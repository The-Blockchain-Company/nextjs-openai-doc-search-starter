# Introduction

> This document, the *PCI Mobile Payments on COTS* (MPoC) standard
> (hereinafter referred to as the "MPoC Standard" or "standard"),
> defines security requirements, test requirements, and guidance for
> entities involved in the development, deployment, and operation of
> merchant operated mobile payment acceptance solutions that use COTS
> devices.
>
> Solutions that do not use COTS devices, use devices that are intended
> for integration into another product, or solutions that are intended
> for use by the cardholder themselves using their own COTS device, are
> not considered by this standard. Similarly, MPoC does not consider or
> allow for solutions that are to be deployed into an environment that
> is not merchant attended.
>
> The security requirements described in this document provide a
> security framework to protect the confidentiality and integrity of
> sensitive payment information captured and processed in MPoC
> Solutions. The test requirements outlined in this document provide
> details of the testing processes performed by the evaluation
> laboratories as part of the validation testing of the solutions.
>
> The MPoC standard allows for an optional modular approach to the
> development of a mobile payment solution. An MPoC Solution is
> considered a monolithic solution if the MPoC Solution does not use or
> integrate any other listed MPoC Products, and instead is assessed as a
> complete implementation. Alternatively, an MPoC Solution may be
> considered a composite solution if it does use and/or integrate one or
> more listed MPoC Products. The following bullets provided below
> outline the different types of MPoC Product that are supported by this
> standard for separate validation and listing:

-   **MPoC Software:** All software that implements the base
    functionality required by the MPoC Solution, including the
    functionality for accepting account data (optionally including the
    cardholder PIN) on COTS devices. The MPoC Software must implement at
    least one form of COTS-native account data entry, either COTS-native
    NFC or COTS-native PIN entry. The MPoC Software scope also includes
    the attestation components, back-end functionality, and any APIs
    offered. The backend may optionally also include the payment
    processing environment and functionality.

> MPoC Software may rely on hardware functions or systems, such as those
> provided by the COTS platform(s) or back-end HSMs. MPoC Software that
> is separately validated and listed on the PCI SSC website is
> considered an MPoC Software Product.

-   **Attestation and Monitoring Service:** The operation of the
    attestation and monitoring functionality of a listed MPoC Software
    Product. An Attestation and Monitoring Service cannot be used by an
    MPoC Solution that is not using an MPoC Software Product supported
    by that Attestation and Monitoring Service.

-   **MPoC Solution:** The set of components and processes that supports
    mobile payment acceptance and protection of account data on a COTS
    device. At a minimum, the solution includes the MPoC Application,
    attestation system, and the back-end systems and environments that
    perform attestation, monitoring, and payment processing.

> The requirements in this standard are organized in five Domains. The
> first two Domains cover the technical and development aspects of the
> software of the MPoC product (the MPoC Software, or equivalent
> functionality in as implemented in a monolithic MPoC Solution (Domain
> 1)),
>
> and the MPoC Application (Domain 2). The last three Domains cover the
> operational aspects of the MPoC Software, Attestation and Monitoring
> Service, and MPoC Solution.

-   **Domain 1: MPoC Software Core Requirements:** The security and test
    requirements that apply specifically to the MPoC Software and MPoC
    Software lifecycle processes. The core Module in this Domain
    includes security requirements such as secure software and secure
    software lifecycle processes, integrity protection, sensitive
    information protection, and secure channels. This Domain includes
    optional Modules and Sections that are applicable only to MPoC
    Software supporting the relevant payment acceptance or cardholder
    verification methods (such as COTS-native NFC, or COTS-native PIN
    entry).

-   **Domain 2: MPoC Application Integration**: The security
    requirements and test procedures that apply to MPoC Applications,
    including those that integrate previously assessed MPoC Software.
    The requirements in this Domain include the secure integration and
    usage of the MPoC Software, and the security of the complete MPoC
    Application.

-   **Domain 3: Attestation and Monitoring**: The security requirements
    and test procedures that apply specifically to a service provider
    operating the back-end attestation and monitoring environment(s).
    This service provider is responsible for maintaining the COTS
    platform baseline, interpreting and responding to data collected
    from the COTS platforms, and the security of attestation and
    monitoring environment.

-   **Domain 4: MPoC Software Management**: The security requirements
    for the operational management of software products and the
    management of cryptographic keys and encryption systems used in the
    MPoC Solution. This includes the security requirements for signing
    and distribution MPoC Software and MPoC Applications, and the key
    management for these software products as well as back-end systems.
    The MPoC Software Management Domain may apply to more than one
    entity within an MPoC Solution.

-   **Domain 5: MPoC Solution**: The security requirements and test
    procedures that apply to MPoC Solution providers who are responsible
    for managing the interaction between all parties in an MPoC
    Solution, and the security of any MPoC specific decryption or
    (payment) switching environments. The MPoC Solution provider is also
    responsible for ensuring that any associated MPoC Applications,
    which are not already listed as part of an MPoC Software Product,
    meet the requirements of this standard and are included as part of
    their MPoC listing.

## Roles and Responsibilities

> There are several stakeholders involved in maintaining and managing
> PCI standards. The following describes the high-level roles and
> responsibilities as they relate to the PCI Mobile Payments on COTS
> standard.

-   **PCI SSC** --- PCI SSC maintains various PCI standards, supporting
    programs, and related documentation. In relation to this standard,
    PCI SSC:

    -   Maintains the Mobile Payments on COTS Security and Test
        > Requirements (this document).

    -   Maintains supporting documentation including reporting
        templates, attestation forms, technical frequently asked
        questions (FAQs), and guidance to assist entities implementing
        and assessing to the standard.

    -   Reviews and monitors Evaluation Reports and related change
        submissions submitted to PCI SSC by PCI Recognized Laboratories
        for completeness and competency with baseline quality, security,
        and security testing standards.

    -   Maintains engagement with the industry security evaluation
        stakeholders to ensure that the evolving threat landscape is
        effectively addressed during the evaluation work.

    brands develop and enforce their respective programs related to
    compliance with PCI standards including, but not limited to:

    -   Requirements, mandates, and deadlines for compliance to PCI
        > standards.

    -   Which organizations are required to comply with PCI standards.

-   **PCI-Recognized Laboratories** --- PCI-recognized laboratories are
    responsible for maintaining the required knowledge, expertise, and
    equipment necessary to execute all test activities, and to perform
    the required evaluation and generate an evaluation report
    documenting the results. Not all PCI-recognized laboratories are
    qualified to perform evaluations using this standard. For further
    information, please consult the *Mobile Payment on COTS Program
    Guide*.

-   **EMVCo** --- EMVCo is the global technical body owned by American
    Express, Discover, JCB, MasterCard, UnionPay, and Visa that
    facilitates the worldwide interoperability and acceptance of secure
    payment transactions by managing and evolving the EMV Specifications
    and related testing processes. Adoption of EMV Specifications and
    associated approval and certification processes promotes a unified
    international payments framework, which supports an advancing range
    of payment methods, technologies, and acceptance environments.

> Additionally, the following entities are identified for the purpose of
> this standard:

-   **MPoC Software vendor** --- The MPoC Software vendor is an optional
    entity developing, distributing, and supporting the MPoC Software.
    An MPoC Software vendor is responsible for ensuring that the MPoC
    Software they develop meets the requirements outlined in *[Domain
    1:](#domain-1-mpoc-software-core-requirements) [MPoC Software Core
    Requirements](#domain-1-mpoc-software-core-requirements)*.

-   **Attestation and monitoring service provider** --- These optional
    entities are involved in the deployment and operation of the
    attestation and monitoring component of the MPoC Software within a
    back-end environment. The entity operating the attestation and
    monitoring (A&M) service is responsible for ensuring that all
    requirements outlined in *[Domain
    3:](#domain-3-attestation-and-monitoring) [Attestation and
    Monitoring](#domain-3-attestation-and-monitoring)* are met.

-   **MPoC Solution provider** --- An MPoC Solution provider is the
    entity that has overall responsibility for the implementation and
    management of an MPoC Solution. The MPoC Solution provider is
    responsible for ensuring that all requirements are met,

> including any requirements fulfilled by other organizations on behalf
> of the MPoC Solution provider (e.g., attestation and monitoring
> service providers). In addition, MPoC Solution providers are
> responsible for ensuring that any MPoC Applications are securely
> integrated with the MPoC Software, and are securely distributed to
> merchants.

# Scope of Mobile Payments on COTS Standard

> In traditional merchant-facing card-based payment scenarios, account
> data (e.g., PAN, PIN, etc.) is entered into a device specifically
> designed for protecting this data, such as a PCI PTS POI approved PIN
> entry device (PED). The payment industry recognizes PEDs that have
> been independently tested and comply with detailed security
> requirements developed by PCI to ensure the confidentiality,
> integrity, and availability of the PIN data. Traditional PEDs rely on
> hardware protections as the primary mechanisms to ensure the security
> of PIN data within the device. Merchants use traditional PEDs to
> support cardholder PIN acceptance.

> Mobile payment acceptance enables the processing of payment
> transactions (e.g., using a smartphone or tablet that performs the
> functions of an electronic point-of-sale terminal). These solutions
> rely on a combination of mechanisms and security controls including,
> but not limited to, COTS device hardware, application software, and
> independent management and oversight of the entire process to ensure
> the security of the transaction and the cardholder verification data.
>
> ***Note:** MPoC Solutions are intended for a merchant-attended
> environment only.*

## Mobile Payments on COTS---Payment Acceptance Channels and Cardholder Verification Methods

> This standard is designed to allow mobile payment solutions to support
> multiple payment-acceptance channels and cardholder verification
> methods. For example, one solution could support a COTS-native NFC
> interface without PIN entry, while another solution could be designed
> to support COTS-native-NFC interfaces for contactless card entry with
> PIN, as well as also supporting PCI PTS SCRP devices.
>
> [Figure
> 2](#figure-2-mobile-payments-on-cots-solution-showing-various-cvm-and-account-data-acceptance-options)
> shows the functional model of the solution that uses a software MPoC
> Application, with the option of additional hardware in the form of PCI
> PTS SCRP or Magnetic Stripe Reader (non-PTS approved MSR), for
> protecting account data.
>
> This standard defines the requirements for assessment to validate
> candidate MPoC Products prior to it being listed on the PCI SSC
> website. For details on compliance programs outlining the use of
> listed MPoC Products, please refer to the relevant payment card
> brands.

> The standard currently supports the following payment acceptance
> channels:

-   COTS-native NFC interface

-   PCI PTS SCRP devices for contact, contactless, and MSR-based
    transactions

-   Non-PTS approved MSR devices validated through the MSR appendix of
    this standard

-   Manually entered account data and cardholder verification methods

-   COTS-native PIN entry

-   No CVM

-   CDCVM

> Support for any of the payment acceptance channels and/or CVMs
> described above is optional -- the only requirement is that an MPoC
> Solution, or MPoC Software Product, must support chip-based payments
> and at least one COTS-native method of entry. As examples, an MPoC
> Solution may support COTS-native NFC and COTS-native PIN entry on the
> same device, it may support COTS-native NFC without PIN, or it may
> support account data entry through external readers only with
> COTS-native PIN.
>
> However, an MPoC Solution (or MPoC Software Product) may not support
> only MSR or manual entry-based payments, or methods of account data
> entry performed exclusively through a PCI PTS SCRP, without any
> COTS-native account data entry methods. Individual transactions are
> exempt from this requirement; any individual transaction may be MSR
> based, or exclusively use a PCI PTS SCRP -- as long as the overall
> MPoC Solution (or MPoC Software Product if that is the MPoC Product
> under assessment) supports at least one COTS-native account data entry
> method.

## Mobile Payments on COTS---Security Model

> The security model of an MPoC Solution relies in large part (but not
> entirely) on mechanisms that support attestation and monitoring (to
> ensure the security mechanisms are intact and operational), detection
> (to notify when anomalies are present), and response (controls to
> alert and take action). The online nature of COTS devices provides
> opportunities to extend these capabilities to back-end monitoring
> systems.
>
> In addition, COTS devices that have specialized hardware-based
> security mechanisms, such as secure element (SE) or trusted execution
> environment, may use these mechanisms for secure storage or processing
> of cryptographic material or account data, or for functions supporting
> the attestation of the COTS device.
>
> There are, however, individual components of a software solution where
> there is limited control (e.g., the underlying COTS platform). Because
> these are COTS devices, there is an assumption that these components
> (e.g., COTS OS, configuration of hardware components of a phone, etc.)
> are unknown or untrusted. It must be assumed that an attacker has full
> access to the software that executes on any unknown or untrusted
> platform where that "software" may be a binary executable, interpreted
> bytecode, etc., as it is loaded onto the platform. Therefore, it
>
> is important for the MPoC Software to provide inherent protections
> that complicate reverse engineering and tampering of the code
> execution flow on the COTS platforms to which it is deployed. This may
> include, but is not limited to, protections using obfuscation of the
> code, internal integrity checks for code and processing flows,
> encryption of code segments, etc.
>
> The architecture of an MPoC Solution relies on the following
> components that combine to provide for protection, attestation,
> detection, and response controls:

-   A COTS device that is operated by the merchant to run the MPoC
    Application. The COTS device may have a TEE or secure element
    built-in, but this is not a requirement.

-   MPoC Application that resides on the COTS device and:

    -   Collects and passes attestation data about any attached hardware
        systems (such as a PCI PTS SCRP or non-PTS approved MSR), COTS
        platform, and MPoC Application to the attestation and monitoring
        back-end systems.

    -   Contains software protection mechanisms to maintain its own
        integrity against attack.

    -   Securely communicates account data (and other sensitive assets
        such as cardholder PINs, where these are supported and used) to
        back-end systems.

    -   (Optional) a secure UI for entry of account data entry methods
        (such as PIN, PAN, or security codes), and encryption of this
        data.

    -   (Optional) a secure method for the entry and encryption of the
        account data acquired through COTS-native NFC read.

-   Set of back-end systems that perform functions for the MPoC Solution
    such as:

    -   Attestation and monitoring systems process attestation data from
        the MPoC Application and enforce pre-established security
        policies as well as provision security controls to detect,
        alert, and mitigate suspected or actual threats and attacks
        against the PCI PTS SCRP, MPoC Application, and the COTS
        device*.*

    -   Processing environment that receives encrypted account data,
        cardholder data and, if applicable, cardholder verification
        method (e.g., PIN data from the PCI PTS SCRP).

-   (Optional) PCI PTS SCRP or non-PTS approved MSR device that supports
    the solution. The PCI PTS SCRP is SRED-enabled and connected to the
    COTS device. The PCI PTS SCRP optionally provides:

    -   Protection of account data

    -   Translation of PIN data for forward processing

    -   Secure random seeding and signing

# MPoC SDKs and MPoC Applications

> All software within an MPoC Software product, or software within a
> monolithic MPoC Solution that provides for the security of MPoC assets
> such as account data or cryptographic keys, must be assessed to
> *[Domain 1:](#domain-1-mpoc-software-core-requirements) [MPoC Software
> Core Requirements.](#domain-1-mpoc-software-core-requirements)* This
> includes any applicable optional Modules corresponding with the
> supported payment acceptance channels and cardholder verification
> methods (such as COTS-native PIN entry, or COTS-native NFC).
>
> The MPoC Software is considered as two separate parts -- the MPoC SDK
> (intended for integration into an MPoC Application) or complete MPoC
> Application itself, and the back-end software including the MPoC
> Attestation and Monitoring software. The MPoC SDK or MPoC Application
> execute on the COTS platform, although they may include remote
> execution components (such as a remote kernel).
>
> Any MPoC Application may optionally support APIs that accept
> non-sensitive payment initiation data, such as an amount, from another
> "calling" application or function. This allows for an MPoC Solution to
> provide for payment initiation from applications outside of the scope
> of MPoC validation and listing -- by providing an API through which an
> MPoC Application may receive non-sensitive payment initiation and
> response data (such as amount).
>
> Therefore, there are three types of COTS software considered in an
> MPoC Solution:

1.  The MPoC SDK, which is designed to be integrated into an MPoC
    Application.

2.  The MPoC Application itself, which may or may not integrate an MPoC
    SDK.

3.  A \'calling application,' which can interface to APIs exposed by the
    MPoC Application to initiate payment acceptance (not in scope of
    MPoC assessment).

> For any MPoC SDK, the following methods of integrating a set of
> pre-developed software as a component of an MPoC Solution have been
> considered in the creation of this standard:

-   Software that is designed and implemented as an entirely separate
    MPoC Application from a "calling application" executed in a
    completely separated execution environment (e.g., SE/TEE).

-   Software that is an entirely separate MPoC Application executed in
    the same runtime environment as a calling application, invoked
    through OS APIs (e.g., Intent on Android) by that calling
    application.

-   Software that is integrated into the MPoC Application as a
    pre-compiled code (e.g., library).

-   Software that is integrated into the MPoC Application as source
    code, which is compiled with the MPoC Application (this is not a
    permitted implementation for an MPoC Software product).

> Due to the risk of modification of the MPoC Software, this standard
> does not allow for an MPoC SDK that is distributed and integrated as
> source code.
>
> ***Note:** An MPoC Application may integrate up to two MPoC SDKs.*

## MPoC SDK Types and MPoC Application Implementations

> An MPoC SDK, where one exists, may be implemented as one of two types:

-   An Isolated MPoC SDK

> An Isolated MPoC SDK must provide for sufficient isolation of its
> memory space and be validated during the laboratory assessment that
> cleartext sensitive assets, such as account data or cryptographic
> keys, are not accessible by an MPoC Application that integrates that
> SDK.

-   A non-Isolated MPoC SDK

> A non-Isolated MPoC SDK is an MPoC SDK that is unable to be validated
> to provide sufficient isolation to the cleartext sensitive assets from
> the MPoC Application.
>
> In each case, the validation of "sufficient isolation" is based on the
> laboratory assessment and costing framework outlined in the MPoC
> standard. Assets that are already sufficiently protected, e.g.,
> through the use of cryptography or truncation (for PANs), are not
> considered in the determination of an Isolated or non-Isolated SDK.
>
> In all cases, an Isolated MPoC SDK cannot allow for sensitive
> cleartext data to be exposed to the MPoC Application, even if that
> functionality is optional or provided by some back-end function
> related to the MPoC Software. This is because the goal of an Isolated
> MPoC SDK is to prevent access to the sensitive assets -- regardless of
> if this access is intended or not -- so that even if the MPoC
> Application is compromised, the sensitive assets remain secure. There
> can be no APIs or methods exposed that would allow for that
> compromised MPoC Application to gain access to those sensitive assets
> in cleartext.
>
> Based on these two types of MPoC SDK, the MPoC standard additionally
> supports the implementation of MPoC Applications in three different
> ways:

1.  Monolithic MPoC Applications that do not integrate an MPoC SDK from
    a listed MPoC Software Product.

> These types of MPoC Applications must be assessed to all relevant
> Domain 1 requirements (only requirements covering account data entry
> methods supported by the MPoC Application are assessed). Monolithic
> MPoC Applications are assessed to Section 2B of the MPoC standard.

2.  MPoC Applications that integrate a non-Isolating MPoC SDK.

> These types of MPoC Applications integrate an MPoC SDK, from a listed
> MPoC Software Product, that has not been validated to provide memory
> and cleartext asset isolation. MPoC Applications that integrate a
> non-Isolating MPoC SDK must be assessed to all requirements of Domain
> 2 of the MPoC standard.

3.  MPoC Applications that correctly integrate Isolating MPoC SDKs only.

> These types of MPoC Applications integrate an MPoC SDK, from a listed
> MPoC Software Product, that has been validated to provide memory and
> cleartext asset isolation. MPoC Applications that correctly integrate
> only Isolating MPoC SDKs may be assessed to the Section 2A
> requirements of Domain 2 of the MPoC standard only.
>
> If the MPoC Application does not correctly integrate an Isolating MPoC
> SDK, or the MPoC Application bypasses, modifies, or supplements the
> payment and/or security features of the Isolating MPoC SDK, then the
> MPoC Application must also be validated against the requirements of
> Section 2B of Domain 2.
>
> An MPoC Application is permitted to integrate up to two MPoC SDKs
> (although this is a not a requirement, and integration of one or no
> MPoC SDKs is also permitted). An MPoC Application that integrates a
> non-Isolating MPoC SDK is always assessed against all requirements of
> Domain 2. Therefore, an MPoC Application that integrates two MPoC
> SDKs, where one is an Isolating SDK and one is a non-Isolating SDK, is
> required to be assessed against all requirements of Domain 2 even
> though one of the MPoC SDKs it integrates is an Isolating SDK.
>
> A monolithic MPoC Application, or MPoC SDK of either type, may be
> implemented in part or whole outside the REE of the COTS device, e.g.,
> as a "trustlet" executed within a TEE, which provides for the GUI and
> other interfaces necessary to provide the required account data
> inputs.
>
> An MPoC Application may be included as part of an MPoC Software
> Product as well as part of an MPoC Solution. For example, an MPoC
> Software product may be listed as providing an Isolating MPoC SDK, a
> non-Isolating MPoC SDK, and/or a complete MPoC Application (which may
> itself integrate an MPoC SDK from the same MPoC Software Product).
>
> MPoC Applications that access account data are to be assessed against
> the requirements of Domain 1, regardless of if they integrate an MPoC
> SDK (or either type) or not.
>
> An Isolated SDK may share some assets or configurations with the
> integrating MPoC Application, such as permissions with determine
> access to underlying COTS Platform systems, as long as those shared
> assets/configurations do not expose cleartext sensitive assets. For
> example, permission to access a hardware-backed keystore that contains
> encryption keys used to protect the sensitive assets could be shared
> between an Isolating MPoC SDK and the integrating MPoC Application, as
> long as those keys could not be used for decryption (as this would
> allow a compromised MPoC Application to remove the protection provided
> by the encryption processes).

# MPoC Domain and Section Applicability

> An MPoC Solution may involve up to three types of Entities -- an MPoC
> Solution provider, an MPoC Software vendor, and an MPoC Attestation
> and Monitoring Service provider. The MPoC requirements applicable to
> each are illustrated below. An MPoC Solution that includes no other
> listed MPoC Products is always considered a monolithic MPoC Solution.
>
> The MPoC standard allows for an entity to take on more than one role
> in an MPoC Solution. For example, an MPoC Software vendor may choose
> to also take the role of an MPoC Solution provider while outsourcing
> the A&M operation to an MPoC Attestation and Monitoring Service
> provider. In this case, the MPoC Solution may consist of an MPoC
> Application that exposes payment APIs for other applications to call,
> rather than an MPoC SDK to be integrated into new MPoC Applications
> (although this would also be possible).
>
> In another example, an MPoC Software vendor may take the role of an
> A&M Service provider themselves, operating their back-end software for
> different MPoC Solution providers. Other possible combinations also
> exist. However, in all cases, the requirements that apply to that role
> will apply to any entity taking on that role. Only validated MPoC
> Solutions are permitted to be deployed for payment acceptance -- it is
> not acceptable to have an MPoC Software Product performing payment
> acceptance without integration into an MPoC Solution, even if that
> MPoC Software Product is listed and includes an MPoC Application.
>
> A monolithic MPoC Solution does not use any other listed MPoC
> Products, and therefore must always use a monolithic MPoC Application,
> and an internally developed and operated Attestation and Monitoring
> system. If an entity wants to create an MPoC Solution with MPoC
> Applications that integrate an MPoC SDK, and/or that uses an
> outsourced Attestation and Monitoring Service, that MPoC Solution must
> be based on a listed MPoC Software Product.
>
> When reviewing the table below, consideration to the divide between
> the development and operational Domains of the MPoC standard is
> important. For example, MPoC Software is required to provide both an
> MPoC SDK component and/or MPoC Application (that executes on the COTS
> platform) and a back-end A&M component. The assessment of the
> technical and development aspects of these MPoC Software components is
> performed in Domain 1. However, the operational aspects of using these
> MPoC Software components is assessed in Domain 3 and 4.

2.  An MPoC Solution or MPoC Software Product must implement one or both
    of COTS-native NFC or COTS-native PIN entry.

3.  This Module is only applicable if MPoC Applications integrating an
    MPoC SDK are supported.

4.  This Module is only applicable to MPoC Applications that integrate a
    non-Isolating MPoC SDK, or that are found to not correctly integrate
    an Isolating MPoC SDK.

5.  This Section only applies to an MPoC Software vendor when an aspect
    of the MPoC Software product is directly distributed to merchants or
    end users.

6.  This Section only applies to an MPoC Software vendor when the MPoC
    Software vendor performs ongoing key management operations, such as
    updates to software protected cryptography.

# Example MPoC Implementations

> This section provides some examples of how an MPoC Solution may be
> realized. The examples provided are non-exhaustive, and other types of
> implementations -- with different combinations of listed MPoC Products
> and MPoC Applications -- may be possible.

## Monolithic MPoC Solution Examples

> A monolithic MPoC Solution is defined by the fact that it does not
> integrate or use any other listed MPoC Products. A monolithic MPoC
> Solution may include or use external card readers, such as a PCI PTS
> SCRP or non-PTS approved MSR. Monolithic MPoC Solutions are assessed
> to all Domains of the MPoC Standard, although some
> Modules/Sections/requirements may not apply where these are scoped
> solely for the integration or assessment of different MPoC Product or
> account data entry types. Refer to Section: [MPoC Domain and
> Section](#mpoc-domain-and-section-applicability)
> [Applicability](#mpoc-domain-and-section-applicability) above for
> details on the specific Modules and Sections that may apply.
>
> A monolithic MPoC Solution may implement multiple MPoC Applications,
> each with different account data entry methods and CVM support. For
> example, a monolithic MPoC Solution may have four MPoC Applications,
> split across two different operating systems. For each operating
> system there may be one MPoC Application that supports COTS-native NFC
> (with optional PIN as CVM), and one MPoC Application that supports
> card reading through a PCI PTS SCRP (with optional PIN as CVM).
>
> Alternatively, this example MPoC Solution may support only two MPoC
> Applications -- with a single MPoC Application on each supported OS
> providing for both PCI PTS SCRP and COTS-native NFC reading (both with
> optional PIN as CVM).
>
> In all cases, a monolithic MPoC Solution will develop its own MPoC
> Applications and implement its own Attestation and Monitoring systems
> to support the MPoC Application(s) it deploys.

## MPoC Solution implementing a single MPoC Software Product with an Attestation and Monitoring Service

> An MPoC Solution that integrates or uses one or more listed MPoC
> Products is no longer considered a monolithic MPoC Solution. In this
> example, an MPoC Solution integrates a single MPoC Software Product --
> integrating the MPoC SDK into one or more MPoC Applications -- and (in
> this example) also relies on the use of a listed Attestation and
> Monitoring Service provider who supports the same MPoC Software
> Product that includes the MPoC SDK that is used.
>
> In this example, the MPoC SDK being integrated supports an external
> non-PTS approved MSR and COTS-native NFC (with optional PIN support
> for the contactless payment channel). The MPoC Solution is deploying
> two MPoC Applications - one of the MPoC Applications implements both
> payment acceptance channels supported by the SDK (COTS-native NFC and
> non-PTS approved MSR), and one implements only the COTS-native NFC
> (with optional PIN) functions of the MPoC SDK.
>
> In this case, the MPoC Solution would not be assessed against Domain 1
> or Domain 3, as it is not implementing its own software or attestation
> and monitoring systems as part of the core of the MPoC Solution (if
> the MPoC Solution were to implement its own attestation and monitoring
> systems, based on the MPoC Software Product used, Domain 3 assessment
> would be included). The MPoC Applications would be assessed against
> Domain 2, either Module 2A only (if the MPoC SDK is an Isolating SDK
> and is found to be correctly implemented), or both Modules 2A and 2B
> (if the MPoC SDK is non-Isolating). The MPoC Solution will also be
> assessed against the requirements of Domain 4 and 5 of the MPoC
> Standard.
>
> The MPoC Software Product will have been assessed to Domain 1, and the
> Attestation and Monitoring Service to Domain 3, prior to listing of
> those MPoC Products.

## MPoC Solution Implemented by MPoC Software Vendor

> An MPoC Software vendor may choose to implement their own MPoC
> Solution, potentially as a completely monolithic MPoC Solution, or
> based on their separately listed MPoC Software Product and MPoC
> Attestation and Monitoring Service. Assessment in this example would
> follow the examples given above, for either a monolithic MPoC
> Solution, or for an MPoC Solution implementing a single MPoC Software
> Product and Attestation and Monitoring Service.

## MPoC Solution Implementing Multiple MPoC Software Products with Multiple Attestation and Monitoring Services

> In another example, an MPoC Solution may integrate multiple MPoC
> Software Products, in conjunction with one or more Attestation and
> Monitoring Services. In this example, the MPoC Solution integrates two
> MPoC Software Products; one of these supports only COTS-native NFC
> entry (with optional PIN for CVM) on a specific COTS OS (designed
> herein as OS(a)), and the other supports external reading of account
> data (using a PCI PTS SCRP) on two COTS OS's (the previously designed
> OS(a) and another COTS OS designed OS(b)) in addition to COTS-native
> NFC reading on OS(b) (both with optional PIN CVM).
>
> The example MPoC Solution deploys two MPoC Applications. The MPoC
> Application deployed on OS(b) integrates a single MPoC SDK. The MPoC
> Application deployed on OS(a) integrates two MPoC SDKs, one MPoC SDK
> to support COTS-native NFC (with optional PIN CVM) and the other MPoC
> SDK to support reading through the PCI PTS SCRP (with optional PIN
> CVM).
>
> The COTS-native PIN entry is separately managed by each MPoC SDK, as
> the PIN (or other sensitive assets) cannot be passed outside of the
> MPoC SDK boundary. Although this may lead to a different user
> experience for PIN entry for the MPoC Application deployed on OS(a),
> COTS-native PIN entry for any transaction must always be managed by
> the MPoC SDK that is used to read the payment card for that
> transaction.
>
> In this example MPoC Solution is not assessed to Domain 1 or Domain 3,
> as it relies on the MPoC Software that it integrates and does not
> implement any monolithic MPoC Applications. Each MPoC Application is
> assessed to Domain 2, with the MPoC Application that targets OS(s)
> being assessed with respect to both of the MPoC SDKs it integrates.
>
> In the case where an MPoC Solution is integrating more than two MPoC
> Software Products, the use of more than two MPoC SDKs within any one
> MPoC Application is not permitted.

# Relationship between This Standard and Other PCI Standards

> Various security requirements in this standard are based on elements
> of, or share similarities with, other PCI standards, as follows:

-   COTS device, attestation, and monitoring security controls to
    protect the security of payment transactions on COTS devices are
    consistent with PCI Software-Based PIN Entry on COTS (SPoC) and PCI
    Contactless Payments on COTS (CPoC).

-   POI devices are approved per PCI PIN Transaction Security (PTS)
    Point of Interaction (POI) requirements.

-   HSMs in the back-end environment used for PIN and account-data
    decryption, and related cryptographic-key operations require
    validation to PCI PTS HSM or FIPS 140-2, or 140-3, Level 3 (or 4).

-   Software used in the solution and software lifecycle practices are
    developed using best practices consistent with the PCI Software
    Security Framework (SSF).

-   The back-end payment-processing environment is required to be PCI
    DSS compliant.

-   The back-end PIN-processing environment is required to be PCI PIN
    Security compliant.

-   The security requirements for back-end attestation and monitoring
    environment are developed from PCI DSS DESV (where the back-end
    attestation and monitoring systems are sufficiently isolated from
    any account data processing).

## Relationship between This Standard and PCI DSS

> There is an independent relationship between this standard and PCI
> DSS. A back-end attestation and monitoring environment could be part
> of a cardholder data environment (CDE) or be completely separate from
> any CDE. If a back-end attestation and monitoring environment contains
> account data, it is subject to PCI DSS DESV in accordance with payment
> brand compliance programs.
>
> If an entity has already applied PCI DSS to protect its back-end
> attestation and monitoring environment as part of its CDE, the entity
> may be able to leverage the results of its PCI DSS assessment to meet
> the security requirements in this standard. For details, refer to
> [*Appendix A*.](#_bookmark102)

## Relationship between This Standard and PCI PTS POI Standard

> The PCI PTS POI standard supports the use of secure hardware and Point
> of Interaction (POI) devices within the payment ecosystem. The use of
> PTS POI devices in the solution to store, process, or transmit account
> data prevents exposure of sensitive assets on COTS devices and
> facilitates the principle of strong isolation of PIN and PAN. For more
> information about the PCI PTS POI, including applicability to
> different types of hardware, refer to the PCI PTS POI Program Guide at
> [*www.pcisecuritystandards.org*](http://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/).

### Use of PCI PTS SCRP Devices

> A PCI PTS SCRP used with an MPoC Solution must be an approved PCI PTS
> device that is listed on the PCI SSC Approved Device website with an
> SCRP Approval Class. This class of devices may optionally support
> contact magnetic stripe reading functionality. When included with an
> MPoC Solution, a PCI PTS SCRP may be used for any method of card data
> presentment that it supports, including for the acceptance of
> contactless payment cards. A PCI PTS SCRP may also be included when a
> COTS-native presentment method is used in place of one supported by
> the PCI PTS SCRP (e.g., a PCI PTS SCRP that supports contactless cards
> could be used with an MPoC Solution that uses COTS-native NFC
> acceptance instead).

### Use of Non-PTS Approved MSR

> When non-PTS approved MSR is supported by the solution, the tester
> must validate the standalone non-PTS approved MSR device against
> specific requirements in *[Appendix F: MSR Security
> Requirements](#appendix-e-msr-security-requirements)* that focuses on
> encryption of account data on the non-PTS approved MSR device.

## Relationship between This Standard and PCI SSC Software Standards

> PCI SSC supports the use of secure payment software within entities'
> cardholder data environments via the PCI Security Software Framework
> (SSF). The SSF consists of the Secure Software Standard and the Secure
> Software Lifecycle (Secure SLC) Standard. Software that is PCI SSC
> validated and listed provides assurance that the software has been
> developed using secure practices and has met a defined set of security
> requirements. Entities that develop their own software are encouraged
> to refer to PCI SSC's security software standards and consider the
> requirements therein as best practices to use in their development
> environments. Secure payment software implemented in a PCI
> DSS-compliant environment will help to minimize the potential for
> security breaches leading to compromises of account data and the
> damaging fraud resulting from these breaches.
>
> The MPoC standard requires developers of MPoC Software (or the
> software components of a monolithic MPoC Solution) are assessed
> against the requirements of the PCI Secure SLC standard. It is not a
> requirement that these entities are listed on the PCI website as
> meeting these requirements.

## Relationship between This Standard and PCI PIN Standard

> MPoC Solutions may be used for the acceptance of cardholder PINs. The
> security of the key management and cryptographic processes used to
> handle customer PINs are covered by the PCI PIN standard, and
> therefore this standard requires compliance to the PCI PIN
> requirements for any back-end systems involved in PIN processing.
> Requirement 1 of the PCI PIN standard outlines a need to have all PIN
> acceptance devices approved to PCI PTS and does not need to be
> assessed as compliant for the MPoC implementation.

## Relationship between This Standard and PCI SPoC Standard and PCI CPoC Standard

> The MPoC standard incorporates and builds upon many of the concepts
> and requirements founded in the PCI SPoC and PCI CPoC standards.
> However, the MPoC standard does not supersede or replace these other
> mobile standards. For details of any migration path from an existing
> SPoC or CPoC Solution to the listing of an MPoC Solution, refer to the
> MPoC Program Guide.

# Security Requirements for Mobile Payments on COTS Solution

## Objective-Based Approach to Requirements

> The security and test requirements of this standard address known
> attack scenarios at the time when the standard was published. Any
> entity responsible for some component of an overall MPoC Solution has
> ongoing responsibility to proactively perform risk assessments to
> identify potential security flaws in transaction scenarios that were
> introduced by changes in technology or by the identification of new
> threats and vulnerabilities.
>
> For an objective-based approach to be successful, entities are
> expected to possess a robust risk-management practice as an integral
> part of their "business-as-usual" operational process. While this
> approach provides the entities with the flexibility to implement
> security controls based on identified risk, the entity needs to be
> able to demonstrate how the implemented controls are supported by the
> results of its risk-identification and risk-management practices.
> Without a robust risk-management practice and evidence to support
> risk-based decision making, adherence to the requirements in this
> standard may be difficult to validate.
>
> If security requirements do not define a specific level, rigor, or
> frequency for periodic or recurring activities (e.g., the maximum
> period in which an entity is required to release a security update to
> fix a known vulnerability), the entity may define the level of rigor
> or frequency that is appropriate. The rigor and frequency defined by
> the entity must be supported by documented risk assessments and the
> resultant risk- management decisions. The entity is expected to be
> able to demonstrate that its implementation provides ongoing assurance
> that the security controls or security activities are effective and
> meet all applicable requirements.

## Requirement Frequency

> Certain security and test requirements have been established with
> specific timeframes for activities that must be performed consistently
> via a regularly scheduled and repeatable process. The intent is that
> the activity is performed at an interval as close to that timeframe as
> possible without exceeding it. The entity has the discretion to
> perform an activity more often than specified (e.g., performing an
> activity monthly where the security requirement specifies it be
> performed every three months).

## Requirements Structure

> The security requirements defined within this standard are presented
> in the following format:

-   **Security Objective**. Identifies the high-level security objective
    that the entity is required to meet. Security objectives are broadly
    stated to enable entities flexibility in determining the best
    methods to achieve the stated security objective. However, it is
    expected that the entity produces clear and unambiguous evidence to
    show that the chosen methods are appropriate, sufficient, and
    properly implemented to satisfy the security objective. Below the
    security objective, additional information has been provided to help
    both entities and laboratories understand the intent behind the
    security objective.

-   **Security Requirements**. Specific security controls or activities
    that must be implemented by the entity to support the overarching
    security objective.

-   **Test Requirements**. Describe the expected testing activities to
    be performed by the laboratory to validate whether an entity has met
    a particular security requirement. The test requirements are
    intended to provide both the entity and the laboratory with a common
    understanding of the assessment activities to be performed. The
    specific methods and items examined, and the personnel interviewed,
    are required to be appropriate for the security objective and
    associated requirements being assessed and for each entity's
    particular implementation.

-   **Guidance**. Additional information to help entities and
    laboratories understand the intent of each requirement. The guidance
    may also include best practices that should be considered as well as
    examples of controls or methods that, when properly implemented, may
    meet the intent of the requirement. This guidance is not intended to
    preclude other methods that an entity may use to meet a requirement,
    nor does it replace or extend the requirements to which it refers.

## Testing Methods

> Entities are expected to produce evidence that they have satisfied the
> security requirements defined in this document. The test requirements
> for each security requirement describe the activities to be performed
> by the tester to demonstrate that the entity has met that security
> requirement. Where the tester finds it necessary to develop
> alternative tests, they must provide appropriate justification for
> their use. Test requirements typically include the following
> activities:

-   **Examination**. The tester critically evaluates evidence. Common
    examples of evidence include software design and architecture
    documents (electronic or physical), source code, configuration, and
    metadata files, bug tracking data, and other output from
    software-development systems, and security-testing results. The
    choice of which evidence may be used to meet an examination
    requirement is deliberately left open for the tester to determine.
    However, it is a requirement of this standard that the source code
    of the MPoC Software and MPoC Application is made available for
    review as part of the assessment. It is not acceptable for an
    evaluation report to be provided where no source code was examined
    or used in the process of performing the testing.

> Where this standard uses the term "document," this is not required to
> be a formal physical document. Other types of managing information may
> be acceptable if they contain the required information and have the
> required utility of purpose.

-   **Testing**. The tester evaluates the solution code or the operation
    of the solution software using a variety of security-testing tools
    and techniques. Examples of such tools and techniques include the
    use of automated static analysis security testing (SAST), dynamic
    analysis security testing (DAST), interactive application security
    testing (IAST), and software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
    Manual techniques, such as manual code reviews, penetration testing,
    side-channel attacks, fault injection, and memory scraping, may need
    to also be considered.

-   **Observation**. The tester watches an action or views something in
    the environment. Examples of observation subjects include personnel
    performing tasks or processes, software or system components
    performing a function or responding to input, system
    configurations/settings, environmental conditions, and physical
    controls. Observation may include the performance of "tests," so
    that the output of those tests may be observed, potentially under
    changing conditions as the input is manipulated by the tester or
    other systems.

> An "observation" test process generally differs from a "testing" test
> process in that it involves some aspect of the normal operation of the
> system under test rather than testing of some subsystem or
> subfunction. For example, a process involving validation of
> protections against Man-in-the-Middle attacks through manipulation of
> a TLS connection from a functioning system would be "observation."
> Side-channel analysis of the cryptography implement during the TLS
> process would be performed as part of "testing."

-   **Interview**. The tester converses with individual personnel. The
    purpose of interviews includes determining how an activity is
    performed, whether an activity is performed as defined, and whether
    personnel have particular knowledge or understanding of applicable
    policies, processes, responsibilities, and concepts.

-   **Document**. The tester provides details or information in the
    evaluation report, which may be used in the same or subsequent
    testing requirements.

> The test requirements provide both entities and testers with a common
> understanding of the validation activities to be performed. The
> specific items or processes to be examined or observed and personnel
> to be interviewed are required to be appropriate for the security
> requirement being validated and for each entity's structure,
> operations and business practices. For example, it is expected that
> not every item of information will be contained in a formal document,
> and not every interview will be conducted in person. It is at the
> discretion of the tester to determine the appropriateness or adequacy
> of the evidence provided by the entity to support each security
> requirement. Where bullets are specified in a security requirement or
> test requirement, each bullet is expected to be tested as part of the
> validation.
>
> When documenting the assessment results, the tester identifies the
> testing activities performed and the result of each activity. While it
> is expected that the tester will perform all the test requirements for
> each security requirement, it may also be possible for a security
> requirement to be validated using different or additional testing
> methods. In such cases, the tester is expected to document why
> alternative testing methods were used that differed from those
> identified in this document, and how those methods provided at least
> the same level of assurance as the documented testing methods. Where
> terms such as "periodic," "appropriate," and "reasonable" are used in
> the test requirement, it is the entity's responsibility to define and
> defend its decisions regarding the frequency, robustness, and maturity
> of the implemented controls or processes.

## Security Objective and Assets

> This standard sets forward various security control objectives for the
> purposes of protecting assets. Within the context of this standard,
> assets are elements of the MPoC Solution that are security sensitive
> or are used to provide security to other security-sensitive elements.
> Examples of assets include data such as account data, cardholder PINs,
> certificates, and cryptographic keys. Software may also be considered
> an asset if the correct operation of that software is required to
> provide security protection to other data assets.
>
> Sensitive assets are a sub-set of the asset class that require
> confidentiality protections.
>
> The specific assets used in a solution are expected to be unique to
> how that solution operates, and therefore a comprehensive list is
> required to be developed as part of the evaluation of any MPoC
> Solution.
>
> The security controls required to protect payment information depend
> on the type of payment acceptance channels and cardholder verification
> methods supported by the MPoC Software. All MPoC Software is required
> to meet the security objective, requirements, and test requirements in
> the Core Module. The objective of these security requirements is to
> ensure the integrity of the COTS device, and to reasonably ensure that
> the solutions provide adequate security mechanisms, controls, and
> mitigations to protect the cardholder's account data and other assets
> such as cryptographic keys. These requirements assist with protection
> from unauthorized disclosure, modification, or misuse by restricting
> the available attack surface and making it cost prohibitive to attack.
>
> It is recognized that an attacker may have other objectives, such as
> self-promotion or nation-state attack, and may expend more resources
> to circumvent established controls than is warranted by the direct
> financial rewards.
>
> For the COTS platform components, the objective of these security
> requirements is to provide reasonable assurance that these components
> are kept up to date and have not been tampered with.
>
> The following table provides examples of MPoC Software assets and
> lists the protection required. This protection may be confidentiality
> (C), integrity (I), and integrity with the addition of auditability
> and authentication (I+). This table does not purport to be an
> exhaustive list of all sensitive assets that may be stored or
> processed by an MPoC Solution. assets not identified in this table may
> exist and may require protection.

# Domain 1: MPoC Software Core Requirements

> The security requirements in this Domain apply to the individual
> components and processes that make up the MPoC Software or the
> equivalent areas of software provided by an MPoC Solution where a
> separately listed MPoC Software is not used. Wherever the terms MPoC
> Software or MPoC SDK are used within this Domain, requirements apply
> equally to the equivalent areas of an MPoC Solution that does not use
> listed MPoC Software.
>
> The functional requirements of the MPoC Software can be further
> organized into the following components assessed under this Domain:

-   A software application or a library that implements payment
    acceptance and optional supported cardholder verification methods
    and/or may influence the security of payment data processing on the
    COTS device (the MPoC SDK or a monolithic MPoC Application). This
    software may be executed, in part or as a whole, on the COTS device
    itself or executed remotely and rendered on the COTS device through
    other means.

-   The back-end attestation and monitoring systems that cannot be
    entirely (logically) accessed from the merchant environment and that
    must be capable of being regularly/rapidly updated to respond to new
    threats and to apply changes or updates to the solutions.

-   An optional API provided by the MPoC SDK that allows other
    third-party developers to interface with the MPoC Solution.

-   All contactless kernels used in the MPoC Software, regardless of
    their implementation within MPoC SDK, residing on the COTS device or
    implemented as a remote component of a contactless kernel (e.g.,
    cloud-based).

> Optional Modules within Domain 1 include additional security
> objectives to protect sensitive assets associated with specific
> payment- acceptance channels and cardholder verification methods such
> as following:

-   **PIN Entry on COTS device.** Includes security requirements to
    ensure the integrity of the PIN entry process on the COTS device.
    These requirements apply only to MPoC Software that supports PIN
    CVM.

-   **Offline Payment Transactions.** Includes requirements to ensure
    that support for Offline Payment processing is performed securely.

-   **Secure Entry and Processing of Account Data.** Although not an
    optional Module, this includes optional Sections that provides
    security requirements for account data entry methods, such as
    COTS-native NFC, manual account data entry, or to ensure secure
    pairing with a PCI PTS SCRP, or non-PTS-approved MSR.

> It is expected that the attestation system monitoring systems will
> integrate both local and remote features to allow for the
> identification of new types of attacks, rapid response, and deployment
> of updated mitigations against such threats. When MPoC Software relies
> on COTS hardware-based security controls or features, such as SE or
> TEE, these must be included in the scope of evaluation and evaluated
> against the applicable security requirement in this Domain.
>
> The test requirements of Domain 1 apply to the software used in
> monolithic MPoC Solutions, as well as software that is designed for
> submission and listing as a separate MPoC Software Product.

## Module 1A: CORE

> These requirements are applicable to the MPoC Software. This includes
> the software executed on the COTS device, any Trusted Applications
> (TA) used, and the back-end systems software (processing, monitoring,
> and attestation).

### 1A-1 Secure Software Requirements

> Software is to be developed and maintained according to a defined
> software-security development and lifecycle process. Software
> developers require knowledge to address software vulnerabilities and
> emerging risks.
>
> Development of secure software requires knowledge of common attack
> techniques and vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can change over
> time; therefore, a continuous process to inform software developers
> about these changes is vital. It is not sufficient to confirm that the
> developers have been provided with documentation, books, and/or
> training on secure software development. There needs to be auditable
> confirmation that developers have knowledge of common vulnerabilities
> in the language and environment in which they develop software.
>
> To facilitate reliable and accurate payment transactions, the systems
> and software used as part of the payment-transaction flow must be
> designed, developed, and maintained in a way that protects the
> integrity of payment transactions and the confidentiality of all
> sensitive assets stored, processed, or transmitted in association with
> payment transactions.

### 1A-2 Random Numbers

> Random numbers are relied upon by many security processes and secure
> communications methods. Generation of random numbers with insufficient
> entropy has been the cause of many high-profile vulnerabilities. This
> makes the quality of the random numbers generated by the MPoC solution
> vital. Random numbers are to be generated using a process that ensures
> sufficient entropy (e.g., as defined in *NIST SP800-22*) and lack of
> statistical correlation.
>
> Any random numbers used for security purposes must be generated using
> a secure method, such as a DRNG seeded from a value that comes from a
> trusted source. A COTS device that has a TEE or SE evaluated as a
> random number generation source directly can be used as a source of
> entropy. Otherwise, a DRNG must be used, seeded from an external
> trusted source such as a PCI PTS SCRP or a back-end system such as an
> HSM, in addition to entropy from the COTS device itself. Combining
> these different entropy sources ensures that even if one is
> compromised it does not automatically invalidate the security of the
> random number generation process as a whole.
>
> This applies to all components and parts of the MPoC Software where
> random numbers are required to be generated for security functions.
> Random numbers that are not relied upon directly for security of the
> account data or attestation data, such as random values used in TLS
> sessions where the data being transmitted is otherwise protected using
> application-level cryptography, are exempt from this Section.
>
> The MPoC SDK should maintain an entropy "pool" that is updated
> regularly from the trusted source and other sources on the COTS
> platform. This pool data is sensitive and should be protected.

### 1A-3 Acceptable Cryptography

> Cryptography is an important factor to ensure confidentiality and
> integrity of data and processes that support the MPoC Solution.
> Therefore, it is important that only industry-recognized standard
> cryptographic algorithms and modes of operation be the basis for any
> security services used in the MPoC Solution.
>
> Sensitive assets are required be encrypted on the COTS device for
> transporting to other components of the MPoC Solution using
> cryptographic algorithms and modes of operation known to provide
> suitable levels of security.
>
> All cryptographic keys are required to be used for a single specific
> purpose. For example, a key used to encrypt account data is not
> permitted to also be used to protect the integrity of the
> tamper-detection data.
>
> This requirement does not apply to cryptographic methods applied by
> the PCI PTS SCRP for onward processing by the payment processing
> environment (e.g., PIN block translation functions performed by the
> PCI PTS SCRP, which have been previously assessed to PCI PTS POI
> standard).

### 1A-4 Key Management Design

> Secure key management is critical to the security of cryptographic
> systems. It is a fundamental factor for ensuring the confidentiality
> and integrity of data and processes that support the MPoC Solution.
> key management practices must conform to the industry-accepted
> practices described in this Section. Cryptographic keys are managed
> securely using recognized industry requirements throughout the
> cryptographic lifecycle including, but not limited to:

-   Generation

-   Distribution/conveyance

-   Storage

-   Established cryptoperiods

-   Replacement/rotation when the cryptoperiod is reached

-   Escrow/backup

-   Key compromise and recovery

-   Emergency procedures to destroy and replace keys

-   Accountability and audit

> Secret and private cryptographic keys that are relied upon for
> security are required to be unique per device/application, with the
> exception of keys protected through software-protected cryptography
> means, which are used to establish an initial trust anchor prior to
> provisioning unique keys to the MPoC Application. Shared public keys
> are acceptable, but methods and procedures for revoking compromised
> public key/private key pairs must be implemented. For additional
> information about public key Infrastructure (PKI), refer to X9.79-4.
>
> Operations that involve secret or private cryptographic keys are to be
> performed using split knowledge. Split knowledge requires that no one
> person can determine any single bit of a secret or private
> cryptographic key. Split knowledge can be provided in the following
> ways:

-   Storing keys on secure cryptographic devices (SCD) approved by
    FIPS140-2 Level 3 (or equivalent in FIPS 140-3) or PCI PTS- HSM that
    will not output the cleartext key.

-   Two or more full-length components during key loading*.*

-   An M-of-N secret-sharing scheme.

### 1A-5 Secure Channels

> A secure channel is a communications connection that protects the data
> and assets communicated across it. Secure channels can be provided by
> physical means using tamper-responsive hardware or by logical means
> using transmission security protocols such as TLS, or application
> layer cryptographic methods. Secure channels are vital to protect all
> communications between the various MPoC components including (where
> present):

-   Between the MPoC SDK and external card reader(s)

-   Between the MPoC SDK and back-end environments

> If internal systems such as a TEE or SE are used, and these provide
> for the use of a secure channel to protect communications between
> itself and the REE, then these protections must be used.

## Module 1B: MPoC SDK Software Protection

> These requirements apply to the MPoC SDK, or the aspects of the MPoC
> Application that provide security and payment features (in the case of
> monolithic MPoC Applications). The requirements of this Module 1B do
> not apply to the back-end aspects of the MPoC Software.

### 1B-1 Software Security Mechanisms

> The security mechanisms that protect the MPoC SDK from attacks, such
> as reverse engineering, modification, and monitoring, also help
> protect the MPoC Solution assets as they are entered into, processed
> by, and transferred from the COTS device. The security mechanisms not
> only have a preventive role in the MPoC Software's security; they also
> work as detection mechanisms where they are tied to the A&M.
>
> Many types of security mechanisms exist, each with different strengths
> and protection goals. It is important that the security design of the
> MPoC Software considers the coverage of the security mechanisms and
> the interaction between them. Furthermore, it is important that the
> level of protection (strength) of the security mechanisms is
> evaluated.

### 1B-2 Software-Protected Cryptography

> Protection of cryptographic operations and assets has been
> traditionally provided by tamper-responsive hardware devices such as
> HSMs or tamper-resistant hardware devices such as a secure element.
> Although use of tamper-resistant hardware components is becoming more
> common in COTS devices, support for them is not universal.
>
> Another way to protect cryptographic operations and sensitive assets
> is through software protections, such as software-protected
> cryptography, where the cryptographic functions and storage methods
> used to protect the cryptographic keys are obfuscated such that
> extraction of the sensitive assets or tracing of the execution flow of
> the cryptographic process is rendered computationally expensive. This
> includes systems such as white-box cryptography, and implementations
> where cryptographic operations are executed in a software-protected
> execution environment, such as a vTEE.
>
> When purely software methods are used to protect cryptographic keys,
> such as with software-protected cryptography, the specific instance
> used in the MPoC SDK is to be changed periodically, where the maximum
> period is less than the estimated time it would take to reverse
> engineer the software protections. It is acceptable to have two sets
> of keys during the changeover period, but all old keys are to be
> invalidated when the new keys are installed. The idea behind the
> update is that the software-protected cryptography implementation is
> updated before the needed time to break it is reached.
>
> Using protection mechanisms that are inherent to the platform on which
> the MPoC SDK runs, such as hardware-backed keystore, are another
> option for protecting cryptographic key storage on the COTS device.
> Combined approaches that use different protection methods for
> different platforms, depending on the security features provided by
> that platform, or hybrid implementations that use combinations of
> hardware-based and software-based protections may also be acceptable.
>
> There are several different methods of software protection that can be
> applied to a cryptographic process. This standard does not mandate,
> require, or endorse any particular method. However, this standard is
> created with the expectation that cryptographic keys used to secure
> the MPoC Solution are securely stored and managed. The tester is
> expected to review the implementation and methods used to inform the
> testing of the robustness of these methods, so that there is
> confidence they provide robust protection of cryptographic process and
> sensitive assets they protect.

## Module 1C: Attestation and Monitoring Software

> Attestation is the interaction between a verifier and a prover to
> determine the current security state/behavior of the prover based on
> data provided through measurements performed by the prover. For the
> purposes of this document, the prover is the MPoC SDK (or aspects of
> the MPoC Application) executing on the COTS device, and the verifier
> may have multiple components executing locally on the COTS device and
> remotely in a back-end attestation and monitoring (A&M).
>
> The attestation data may be determined in various ways, such as
> through a health-check interface that can be accessed by the prover.
> Attestation provides necessary assurance to the verifier that
> established and expected security controls at the prover are in an
> acceptable state and have not been tampered with. Organizations
> developing A&M components are subject to these requirements.
>
> There are two types of attestations in MPoC Solutions, where the goal
> is to assess the integrity of the MPoC SDK and MPoC Application, and
> where the goal is to assess the integrity of the COTS platform.
>
> It is a requirement of this standard that the attestation system and
> monitoring system together form the attestation and monitoring (A&M).
> The attestation and monitoring (A&M) includes a back-end system that
> can interpret and respond to the attestation results (i.e., the
> attestation results are required to be monitored). The MPoC SDK can
> attest to the COTS platform or provide attestation results to be
> examined by an external system (such as the attestation and monitoring
> (A&M)). Additionally, some level of ongoing validation of the MPoC SDK
> and COTS platform is required both to supplement the intermittent
> communication with the remote attestation and monitoring (A&M), as
> well as to support offline payments (where applicable). However, as
> the MPoC SDK may be open to compromise this software cannot attest
> itself at all times.

### 1C-1 Coverage

> The attestation and monitoring (A&M) must cover the COTS platform, the
> MPoC SDK, and MPoC Application aspects present in the COTS device.

### 1C-2 Measurements/Detection

> To perform attestation, the A&M component measures the COTS platform,
> MPoC Application, and MPoC SDK. Some or all of these measurements are
> communicated to the A&M backend for analysis and action. The quality
> and ability of the attestation and monitoring (A&M) to detect
> potential attacks are bound by the type of measurements collected by
> the A&M backend, along with the analysis performed on those
> measurements. A&M systems are expected to incorporate knowledge across
> a population of COTS devices, enhancing the detection methods.

### 1C-4 Anti-Tampering

> The MPoC SDK is protected against tampering through the utility of the
> A&M system. For this reason, the attestation and monitoring (A&M) is a
> high-value target for attackers and becomes a critical target that
> needs to be protected against tampering.

## Module 1D: Secure Entry and Processing of Account Data

> This Module covers the use of external and/or COTS-native systems to
> read payment account data from a payment instrument such as a payment
> card. This Module does not cover the entry of account data not
> obtained from the payment instrument, such as PINs. This Module
> includes requirements for the use of PCI PTS SCRP devices, non-PTS
> approved MSR devices, the use of the COTS-native NFC interface to read
> contactless payment instruments, and manual entry of account data.
>
> Only account data entry systems specifically addressed by this
> standard may be used within an MPoC Solution. Future updates to this
> standard may include or support other methods of account data entry.

### 1D-1 Account Data Entry and Encryption

> This Section covers the requirements for all COTS-native account data
> entry methods, and how this data must be secured as it is entered and
> processed. These requirements do not apply to data captured through a
> PCI PTS SCRP or non-PTS approved MSR device.

### 1D-4 COTS-Native NFC Interface

> Contactless payment instruments may be accepted through the
> COTS-native NFC interface of the COTS device. This interface may be
> open to all applications on the COTS device. Protections must be
> implemented to secure the account data as it is entered and to ensure
> that the data is encrypted as soon as possible after processing within
> any payment kernel.
>
> The contactless kernel has direct access to assets. Therefore, the
> processing, memory, and storage used by this kernel must be protected
> to prevent the assets from being compromised when handled by the
> payment kernel.
>
> The requirements in this Section apply to the COTS-native NFC
> interface only.

## Module 1E: PIN Entry on COTS Device

> This Module covers COTS-native PIN entry, even if the capability can
> be disabled at run-time with configuration options. If the MPoC SDK
> does not support PIN entry (or any other situation where the PIN may
> be exposed) on the COTS devices, this Module is not in scope. It is
> possible that the numeric value of the PIN is not captured by the MPoC
> SDK directly; instead, some interim value may be collected, such as
> touch locations or different numeric values, which must be
> reconstructed into the PIN at a later time by the MPoC SDK. These
> interim values must also meet all requirements of this Section in
> respect to protections prior to the construction of the encrypted PIN
> block. In all cases, values related to the customer PIN, including
> individual digits, touch locations, or numeric values that can be
> mapped back to PIN values, must never leave the MPoC SDK until formed
> into a fully encrypted ISO format 4 PIN block.

### 1E-1 COTS-native PIN Entry

> This Section covers the entry of cardholder PINs on the COTS device.
> When the PIN is entered on the COTS device, regardless of whether the
> PIN entry mechanisms are backed by hardware (e.g., TEE), the MPoC SDK
> is required to comply with this Section.

## Module 1F: Offline Payment Transactions

> This Module is applicable to MPoC Software that supports offline
> transactions, even if the capability can be disabled at run-time with
> configuration options. Offline transactions covered by this Module are
> offline EMV transactions (where the transaction authorization is
> completely offline) and store-and-forward transactions (where the
> terminal approves the transaction, but the authorization is performed
> online after connectivity is regained).
>
> Depending on the type of transaction, different types of data may need
> to be stored on the COTS device for eventual transaction
> authorization. Types of data that may need to be stored and protected
> during an offline transaction includes account data and transaction
> results (cryptograms).
>
> Offline PIN verification (with a contact chip card presented through a
> PCI PTS SCRP) may be used in either online or offline approval
> processes.
>
> Assets stored for offline transactions must be protected according to
> their security needs. This Module covers additional security
> requirements that are needed to provide protection to these assets
> when stored on the COTS device. The protection of assets during the
> processing of a payment is covered by separate Modules.
>
> Support for offline payment processing is not a required feature of an
> MPoC Solution and may not be possible in some payment solutions due to
> local or payment brand specific rules.

### 1F-1 Offline Payment Transactions

> This Section covers the requirements for securing the processing and

### 1F-2 Offline Monitoring

> Solutions providing offline payment processing must implement
> attestation and monitoring functions on the COTS device that are able
> to operate securely without connectivity with the A&M back-end
> component. Although these requirements exist to support MPoC Solution
> where a system is disconnected from both the payment processing
> back-end systems, and the A&M back-end systems, it is noted that
> offline payment processing is a separate consideration and does not
> necessarily require that the back-end A&M systems are unavailable.

## Module 1G: MPoC Software Security Guidance

> MPoC Software includes the COTS-based MPoC SDK, which includes both
> payment and attestation functionality, and the back-end attestation
> and monitoring software.
>
> This Module applies in all cases to MPoC Software that is to be
> separately listed as an MPoC Product. This Module additionally applies
> to solutions that separate the MPoC functionality from other parts of
> an MPoC Application, including those where the MPoC Solution Provider
> and the MPoC Application vendor are the same organization.
>
> Monolithic MPoC Solutions are exempt from this Module as they do not
> use an MPoC SDK, and do not outsource the operation of their
> Attestation and Monitoring services.

### 1G-1 Security Guidance

> The security guidance of a component is a document that defines the
> purpose and usage of the component, the security claims of the
> component, the component dependencies, and contains the required
> information to integrate and use the component in a secure manner.

# Domain 2: MPoC Application Integration

> The security requirements in this Domain apply to MPoC Applications
> that integrate, or interface to, a listed MPoC SDK or are developed as
> part of a monolithic solution. MPoC Applications may be developed by
> an MPoC Software vendor, an MPoC Solution provider, or by another
> party. However, the Entity responsible for the listing of an MPoC
> Product is also responsible for managing the assessment and listing of
> any MPoC Applications associated with that MPoC Product.
>
> An MPoC Solution may have more than one MPoC Application listed as
> part of that MPoC Solution listing.
>
> Further details on the different types of MPoC Applications can be
> found in Section: [*MPoC SDKs and MPoC
> Applications*.](#mpoc-sdks-and-mpoc-applications) Details on the
> applicability of the various Domains and requirements of this standard
> can be found in Section: [*MPoC Domain and Section
> Applicability*.](#mpoc-domain-and-section-applicability) Details on
> the process and requirements for MPoC listings can be found in the
> MPoC Program Guide.

## Module 2A: MPoC Software Integration

> This Module covers the integration of one or more MPoC SDKs, which are
> part of listed MPoC Software Products, into an MPoC Application. Any
> one MPoC Application is not permitted to integrate more than two MPoC
> SDKs. An MPoC Application that integrates both an Isolating and
> non-Isolating MPoC SDK, is assessed against requirement as they apply
> to the integration of a non-Isolating MPoC SDK.

### 2A-1 Secure MPoC SDK Integration and Usage

> An MPoC SDK, when used, must be securely and correctly integrated into
> an overall MPoC Solution that includes the integration into the MPoC
> Application distributed and used by merchants. This integration must
> follow the guidance provided by the MPoC Solution provider, as well as
> ensuring requirements of this standard are met for the integrated
> system.

## Module 3B: Baseline

> This Module contains requirements for the management of the COTS
> platform baseline.
>
> ***Note:** This Module is applicable to all A&M service providers,
> and/or monolithic MPoC Solution providers.*

### 3B-1 COTS Platform Baseline and Vulnerability Management

> The COTS platform baseline represents the COTS platforms (including
> both the physical device and the operating systems used) that are
> considered to provide sufficient security and features to allow for
> the installation and execution of the MPoC Application for the
> purposes of accepting payment transactions. This baseline must be
> managed as new security flaws, as well as updated and more secure
> versions of COTS platforms, are released.

# Domain 4: MPoC Software Management

> The security requirements and test requirements in this Domain cover
> the operational management of the software and key management aspects
> of the MPoC Software. This Domain must be implemented by at least one
> entity in the MPoC Solution, and there may be multiple entities who
> are required to comply with these requirements. For example, a
> monolithic MPoC Solution would require that the MPoC Solution provider
> is solely responsible for meeting the requirements of this Domain.
> Alternatively, an MPoC Solution may implement a separately listed A&M
> service provider that has been separately assessed to the requirements
> of this Domain.

## Module 4A: Software Management

> This Module contains the requirements for the secure operation and
> management of the software used in an MPoC Solution. This includes any
> MPoC SDK, A&M Software, and MPoC Application(s).

### 4A-1 COTS Software Distribution and Updates

> Software that is to be installed and executed on the COTS device for
> an MPoC Solution needs to be compliant to this Section. This includes
> the MPoC Application that integrates the MPoC SDK, or the MPoC SDK
> itself if it is instantiated and distributed as a stand- alone MPoC
> Application. Unlike Domain 2 of this standard, which covers the
> development and software of the MPoC Application, this Section covers
> the operational aspects of distributing and maintaining an MPoC
> Application. This includes any ongoing key management requirements, as
> well as the requirements for the secure distribution of the MPoC
> Application(s).
>
> These requirements do not dictate any specific type of distribution
> method for the MPoC Application, such as a dedicated OS Store, but
> they do outline the minimum requirements that any method used to
> distribute the MPoC Application must meet. This includes any initial
> loading of an MPoC Application to a COTS Platform as part of the
> manufacturing or pre-sales provisioning of that COTS platform.

# Domain 5: MPoC Solution

> The security requirements and test requirements in this Domain cover
> the operational management of the complete MPoC Solution. This
> includes the validation of compliance for the payment-processing
> environment, the PIN-processing environment, the MPoC attestation and
> monitoring environment, and any other systems such as the split kernel
> environment.
>
> Where the payment-processing and PIN processing are not performed by
> the MPoC Solution Provider those aspects may be considered out of
> scope of the assessment. Only those aspects that are included--e.g., a
> payment switch operated by the MPoC Solution provider--are to be
> included in the assessment of this Domain. However, it is not possible
> for an MPoC Solution that allows for PIN entry on the COTS device to
> never include validation of a PIN processing environment. Equally, it
> is also expected that all MPoC Solutions will include decryption or
> key management environments for account data sent from the MPoC
> Applications that are deployed as part of the MPoC Solution.
>
> Although it is not necessary for the MPoC Solution provider to
> develop, implement, or operate all of these systems, it is the
> responsibility of the MPoC Solution provider to ensure that the
> relevant requirements for each are met. This may be achieved through a
> monolithic solution, where the MPoC Solution provider is responsible
> for the assessment and compliance of all aspects of the overall MPoC
> Solution, or through a composite solution where the MPoC Solution
> provider utilizes separately assessed and listed MPoC Products. In all
> cases, the MPoC Solution provider remains responsible for the
> compliance and security of the entire MPoC Solution.

## Module 5A: Third Party Management

> This Module contains the requirements regarding the management of
> third parties.

### 5A-1 Merchant Identification and Communication

> MPoC Solutions are used by merchants to accept payment transactions.
> Initial provisioning of the MPoC Application includes providing for
> the unique identification of the merchant. Ensuring that the merchant
> is informed of changes or requirements of the MPoC Solution as the
> solution changes over time is vital to the security of the solution.

# Appendix A Back-end Environment Security Requirements

> Recognizing that back-end attestation systems that support the MPoC
> Solution may not be in scope of PCI DSS, this appendix defines the
> minimum requirements to ensure fundamental security of the back-end
> monitoring system and back-end attestation component.
>
> This appendix is referenced through test items outlined previously in
> the MPoC standard, where security assurance of those systems is
> required, but assessment to PCI DSS is not otherwise in scope. Where
> assessment against the requirements in this appendix is to be
> performed, the MPoC laboratory must confirm that all relevant systems
> and personnel are included. This may include subsets of all possible
> systems or personnel if sufficient clarity on the systems and
> operations of the environment can be determined. The term "all
> personnel" as used within these requirements refers to all personnel
> deemed to be in scope by the MPoC laboratory.
>
> Assessments to Appendix A are expected to be performed by suitably
> qualified individuals and cannot be performed as a self-assessment.
> Remote assessments may be performed to Appendix A, if in line with
> current PCI SSC guidance on remote assessment processes.

# Appendix B Attack Costing Framework

> This appendix provides the framework for cost calculation of attacks
> on the MPoC Solution and/or its components.
>
> It starts with the description of differences between hardware- and
> software-based tamper-responsive systems, followed by guidelines that
> must be considered for an attack cost calculation framework. The
> considerations include the importance of the attack scalability factor
> as well as its definition, remediation and pre-remediation solutions,
> and their role and construction of a full attack path. The full attack
> path rating is constructed based on the tests conducted during the
> evaluation as per testing requirements.
>
> The rating process is described by listing the steps that the
> laboratory performs when rating a full attack based on the information
> collected by partial attack tests and documentation analysis.
>
> The relevant factors that this costing framework takes into account
> include attack time, attacker expertise, scalability, knowledge of A&M
> back- end systems, equipment required for the attack, and COTS device
> access. The detailed description of all the factors is followed by a
> discussion about ratings, with examples that show the importance of
> different factors.

## Differences between Hardware and Software Tampering

> There are differences between a hardware-based tamper-responsive
> system and a software-based tamper-responsive system that are
> considered as we look at the attack-costing framework. The key
> differences are:

4.  **Physical presence and scalability**. A hardware-based
    tamper-responsive system generally requires an attacker to be
    physically present, while a software-based tamper-responsive system
    could be vulnerable to remote attacks. Additionally, the
    exploitation phase of attacks on software-based tamper-responsive
    systems could require much less time, expertise, and tools,
    increasing the scalability of the attack even if the attack requires
    physical presence.

5.  **Layered security**. Like hardware tamper-response systems,
    software tamper-response systems are based on layered security;
    however, the number of layers and relevance of each level are much
    more prominent for software tamper-response systems. This means that
    multiple levels of protection must be bypassed before an attacker
    can extract an asset. Therefore, full and partial attacks must be
    considered as well as remediation techniques. Additionally, the
    detection approach of a tamper state is much more distributed in
    nature. For example, a tamper state might be detected by the
    back-end attestation and monitoring system with support of the MPoC
    Application.

6.  **Technology**. There are much wider sets of technologies that
    contribute to the layered security in the case of software-based
    tamper- responsive systems, such as software-based protection in
    REE, TEE solutions partially supported by hardware, and SE
    solutions.

7.  **Use of COTS and attack stages**: The use of numerous supporting
    technologies in a layered security architecture leads to a full
    attack necessarily consisting of several stages. The following
    stages are considered:

    a.  **Gaining control of the COTS device (rooting).** Gaining
        control of the platform either by using an OEM supported method
        or based on existing exploits is often the first stage of an
        attack. While it is often the first stage, it could be that the
        MPoC Application itself has an exploitable vulnerability and
        that full control of the COTS is not needed for the full attack
        path. Prevention of remote attacks on platforms includes
        regularly updating the COTS OS.

    b.  **Gaining control of the MPoC Application**. Even for a COTS
        device under full attacker control, several security mechanisms
        have to be circumvented to gain control of the MPoC Application.
        Gaining control of the MPoC Application is usually the second
        stage of the attack. It might be possible to access some of the
        assets by controlling only the COTS device (COTS-native NFC
        data, touch signals); however, there might be additional
        security mechanisms added by the MPoC Application, in which case
        control of the MPoC Application is needed.

    c.  **Asset compromise**. Asset compromise is the goal of the attack
        and usually attainable after the second stage of the attack. It
        could be possible that after getting access to the COTS, the
        assets of the MPoC Application could be extracted from memory
        without necessarily gaining full control of the MPoC
        Application. However, the MPoC Application could protect against
        these attack paths.

> Gaining control of the COTS device or device rooting refers to
> obtaining the necessary privileged level of control on the COTS device
> for a particular attack. Currently, rooting or jail-breaking is
> possible in multiple COTS platforms. Therefore, merchants as well as
> merchant employees could enable root access to a COTS Platform on
> which an MPoC Application is running.
>
> Remote exploits to gain root access for the most common COTS device
> types are available for non-patched versions of those COTS platforms.
> Remote exploits to gain access to updated versions of platforms would
> require development of zero-day exploit. The effort required for such
> activity would require a significant amount of work.
>
> The proactive attestation of the platform is the key aspect of the
> security protection against the attacks that require rooting.
> Attestation of the platform that relays on hardware mechanisms within
> the platform (e.g., TEE, Secure processors) usually provide a
> significant barrier for an attacker.
>
> For attacks that require root privileges, rooting is considered a
> first step of a full attack, and the estimated effort for
> identification and exploitation are accounted for based on public
> knowledge. If sufficiently resistant anti-root mechanisms are present
> or rooting of the COTS device is not possible for other reasons, the
> full attack cannot be executed.

## Considerations for Attack Cost Calculations

> The following considerations exist for this attack framework:

-   Identification and exploitation stages

-   Scalability rating factor

-   Remediation and pre-remediation

-   Partial and full attacks

### Identification and Exploitation Stages

> For an attacker wanting to exploit a vulnerability, the vulnerability
> must first be identified. This may appear to be a trivial separation,
> but it is an important one. To illustrate this, first consider a
> vulnerability that is uncovered following months of analysis by an
> expert, and a simple attack method published on the Internet. Compare
> this to a vulnerability that is well known but requires enormous
> expenditure of time and resources to exploit. Of course, factors such
> as time need to be treated differently in these cases, and therefore
> the "cost" required to identify an exploit is included in the costing
> calculation.
>
> Exploitation involves the actual performance of an attack (partial or
> full) on a live system.

### Scalability Rating Factor

> This factor addresses the attack potential that affects large groups
> of merchants that use the same MPoC Application.
>
> While an attack can be remote, local attacks following a few simple
> pre-described steps could lead to a scalable attack. Even if physical
> access is necessary for an effective pre-described attack, the fraud
> could be performed on multiple merchant COTS devices by an organized
> group of attackers or merchant employees downloading the attack
> description from the internet.
>
> Scalability of an attack could depend on the control of the COTS
> device (usually referred to as "rooting") if that step is required for
> the full attack. In some cases, rooting can be achieved by the phone
> owner; however, anti-rooting mechanisms and attestation functions
> supported by the hardware of different COTS could create a significant
> obstacle to scaling such an attack.
>
> Control of the COTS device with highest privileges could also be
> obtained by exploiting the COTS platform remotely. This can
> potentially lead to scalable attacks for partial attacks that depend
> on the rooting of the COTS. The only way to prevent such scalable
> attacks is to have a sufficiently patched system for all approved COTS
> devices.
>
> As the evaluation laboratory assesses only one version of the MPoC
> Application, the portability of the attack cannot be assessed on the
> level of the MPoC Application.
>
> Scalability of the attack is of high importance for MPoC Solutions, as
> reflected in the number of points given to the scalability factor.

### Remediation and Pre-remediation

> Remediation provides the MPoC vendor with a solution for attacks
> against which the MPoC Application cannot defend in the field and
> renders the solutions sufficiently secure. The remediation step is
> possible only after successful detection of some portion of an attack,
> such as changes to the security configuration of the COTS platform,
> but prior to the exploitation of those changes to expose any assets.
>
> In case of pre-remediation, the product is updated on a regular basis
> to implement proactive mitigations against known attack paths, or so
> that the learning curve for the execution of an attack is reset at
> every update -- thereby necessitating a new identification phase for
> any known attacks. Pre-remediation may resolve the attack attempts
> that cannot be detected by A&M back-end systems or prevent those
> attacks that are already known.
>
> Remediation and pre-remediation are not rated, but they determine
> whether a partial attack is feasible. If an attack requires more time
> than the pre-remediation cycle takes, or if the attack can be detected
> and mitigated before the fraud is performed, the partial attack is not
> considered when constructing the full attack.

### Approach to Attack Calculations

> Where the MPoC standard requires a costing be provided as evidence for
> a testing requirement, the costing is to be provided for the specific
> asset or context of the requirement. For example, a test requirement
> may require that a cryptographic key be exposed by the attack, and
> another may require that a PIN be exposed. Each of these attacks are
> to be considered independently and without consideration for any other
> assets. An attack that requires that a PIN be exposed is considered
> successful even if the attack does not also expose the cardholder data
> associated with that PIN.
>
> When considering an attack, the laboratory may look to chain multiple
> "partial" attacks -- each one used to bypass a specific security
> control -- which can be then chained into a "full" attack that is used
> to compromise the specific asset covered by the test requirement under
> assessment.
>
> Partial attacks provide the lab with a possibility to assess strengths
> of different security measures toward the full attack (i.e., a partial
> attack is to test-specific security mechanism(s), and a full attack is
> to compromise a specific assets). It provides the vendor with the
> analysis of which security measures in the chain are the weakest.
> Circumventing one countermeasure while having five working together
> toward a secure product is not a significant increase of risk.
> Circumventing four out of six reduces the security level significantly
> and increases the risk toward a full attack.

-   **Partial and full attacks**. When the lab assesses a partial
    attack, the rating factors should be noted to have a clear view for
    the full attack (combination of multiple partial attacks). After
    assessing the strength of all security protection features, the
    laboratory needs to analyze the possibility of a full attack. For a
    possible full attack, the laboratory will calculate the rating based
    on the factors determined for all partial attacks as described in
    the next section.

-   **Remediation and pre-remediation**. Remediation and pre-remediation
    can be used to disqualify a partial attack from consideration for
    rating. The tester, however, has to perform the attack to assess the
    time needed for the attack development. The

> attack can be disqualified if the pre-remediation and remediation
> techniques act faster than the time needed for identification and
> exploitation. The learning curve from the previous attacks or
> laboratory expertise must be taken into consideration.

## Rating Procedure

> The security landscape in which MPoC systems operate dictates a
> risk-mitigation approach toward the dynamically developing risk
> landscape. In short, if the security robustness can be circumvented by
> a skilled attacker de-layering the security architecture, the MPoC
> Solution could remediate the risk-pre-remediation and remediation
> techniques discussed in the previous section) and keep the security
> level sufficiently high.
>
> The rating approach, which takes into account the attestation and
> monitoring detection time as well as the remediation time before the
> costing for a full attack is considered, is shown in [Figure
> 4](#figure-4-attack-costing-rating-procedure-for-a-full-attack). The
> laboratory needs to collect sufficient evidence that attack detection
> and remediation together are sufficiently strong to prevent an attack,
> including attacks that use knowledge from any previous attack
> attempts. Where the laboratory finds that a partial attack is
> possible, that is some part of the security controls can be bypassed,
> the laboratory may choose to expose this in their reporting so that
> the vendor may consider if steps can be taken to improve these
> security controls.

> Where the A&M is not explicitly required to be disabled by the test
> requirement, consideration is needed with respect to the ability of
> the A&M to detect and remediate the full attack before it is
> completed. If testing indicates that the full attack fails because it
> is detected and successfully remediated prior to the compromise of any
> assets, then that is not to be considered as a successful attack and
> no rating is to be given to that attack. In such cases, the laboratory
> is expected to consider additional or alternative attack paths that
> would not be detected and remediated.
>
> If the partial attack that circumvents the security protection
> mechanism cannot be detected and remediated or pre-remediated, the
> attack can contribute to the full attack path. Therefore, it is
> necessary to identify the values that different rating factors have so
> that a full attack rating can be calculated. A full attack comprised
> of partial attacks without remediation or pre-remediation should be
> rated. The rating of full attacks based on testing of security
> components is described below.
>
> If a full attack cannot be constructed, but there are several
> successful partial attacks, the remaining risk should be identified by
> the laboratory. Because the security is built from layers of
> protection measures, the fact that some of the measures can be

> As shown in [*Figure
> 4*](#figure-4-attack-costing-rating-procedure-for-a-full-attack),
> partial attacks factors are assessed after the tester performs
> relevant tests. Partial attacks are analyzed and the tester determines
> whether a composition could lead to a full attack. For a possible full
> attack, the laboratory will calculate the rating based on the factors
> determined for all partial attacks with the following approach:

-   **Attack time**: The time taken for that stage of the attack
    (identification or exploitation) to be completed.

-   **Attacker Expertise**: The partial attack with the highest
    expertise determines the expertise of the full attack. The full
    attack would not be possible without all the partial attacks and
    expertise needed for them.

-   **Knowledge back-end systems:** If the knowledge of the back-end
    systems is needed for any of the partial attacks, the rating of the
    full attack is determined by the highest level of knowledge needed.
    The full attack would not be possible without all the partial
    attacks.

-   **Equipment**: The partial attack with the most complex equipment
    determines the equipment of the full attack. The full attack would
    not be possible without all the partial attacks and equipment needed
    for them.

-   **COTS device access**: The partial attack with the most difficult
    category of the COTS device access determines the COTS device access
    of the full attack. The full attack would not be possible without
    all the partial attacks and needed COTS device access for each of
    them.

-   **Scalability**: The scalability of the attack is determined based
    on all the partial attacks that have to be executed. If a step
    cannot scale easily to a simple and effective attack, the full
    attack is not scalable.

> The categories are rated with values as described in the rest of this
> section.

### Attack Time

> The **attack time** is given in the time in hours taken by an attacker
> to identify or exploit an attack. If the attack consists of several
> steps, the attack time can be determined and added to achieve a total
> attack time for each of these steps. Actual labor time must be used
> instead of time expired as long as there is not a minimum attack time
> enforced by the attack method applied (for instance, the time needed
> for performing a side-channel analysis, data collections, or the time
> needed for an epoxy to harden).
>
> In those cases where attendance is not required during part of the
> attack time, the attack time is to be taken as expired time divided by
> 3.

### Attacker Expertise

> The attacker expertise factor determines the needed expertise to
> perform the attack identification and exploitation. The identified
> levels of expertise are as follows:

-   **Layman**. Persons without professional or specialized knowledge in
    > a particular subject. An attacker who is capable of using an
    > exploit in the form of a script or a written procedure prepared by
    > another attacker. Laymen could be capable of minimal modifications
    > dictated by a simple step process. A layman may be capable of
    > developing an attack if it involves the use of existing platform
    > features (e.g., activating a screen recorder function provided by
    > the OS).

-   **Proficient**. Persons who are competent and have the necessary
    > ability, knowledge, and skill to perform customization of attacks
    > successfully. They are familiar with the security functionalities
    > and behavior of the underlying systems. Proficient attackers are
    > capable of flashing OS images and can use root access and
    > management software such as Magisk.

-   **Expert**. Persons who are highly knowledgeable and skillful in one
    > or more areas. They are familiar and knowledgeable regarding
    > needed aspects of the solution that could include the underlying
    > OS, algorithms, protocols, hardware components, and physical and
    > logical architectures implemented in the COTS device or system
    > type. This person is capable of developing or introducing complex
    > modifications of an exploit for a specific vulnerability in the
    > system.

### Scalability

> While the time and expertise required to identify and exploit a
> vulnerability are similar for both hardware and software
> tamper-responsive systems, it should be noted that a software attack
> can be re-used much easier on the same or different platforms, even if
> the local presence is required to initiate the exploitation.
>
> Along with the attack specifics, the following categories are
> identified:

+---------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+
| > **Scalability**   | > **Identification**   | > **Exploitation**    |
+=====================+========================+=======================+
| > Instance Specific | > N/A                  | > 18                  |
+---------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+
| > Scalable with     | > N/A                  | 6                     |
| > physical access   |                        |                       |
+---------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+
| > Remotely scalable | > N/A                  | 0                     |
+---------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+

-   **Instance specific:** The attack is not scalable and needs to be
    > heavily customized for each COTS device (e.g., the attack depends
    > on the extraction of keys from each COTS device, and that
    > extraction process must be performed as a bespoke process for each
    > COTS device attacked).

-   **Scalable with physical access:** The attack can be leveraged
    > against multiple COTS Platforms and/or MPoC Application instances,
    > but requires that the attacker has physical access to the COTS
    > device during the attack. Consideration for if locked or unlocked
    > access is necessary is calculated in the "access" part of the
    > costing.

-   **Remotely scalable:** The attack may be leveraged against multiple
    > COTS Platforms and/or MPoC Application instances, and does not
    > require the attacker to have any physical access to the COTS
    > device during the attack. Scalability of the attack is of a very
    > high importance for the MPoC; therefore, it has a high number of
    > points.

> Scalability scoring only applies to the exploitation phase of the
> attack, and a costing that is instance-specific is mostly likely to
> also require proficient or expert skill during the exploitation stage
> of the attack (as expertise is required to be used during the attack
> to enable its application on the instance under attack).
>
> An MPoC assessment must consider the types of COTS Platforms to which
> the MPoC Application may be deployed, but it is not possible to make
> determinations during the assessment of how many specific COTS
> Platforms may be included in any given MPoC Solution. For this reason,
> the scalability factor is given as two types -- scalable (with or
> without physical access), or instance specific. If an attack is
> scalable across any given subset of the COTS Platforms supported, it
> must be considered a scalable attack.
>
> While attacks can be remote, local attacks following a few simple
> pre-described steps can lead to fraud performed on multiple merchant
> COTS devices by an organized group of attackers or by merchant
> employees downloading the description from the internet. Such attacks
> must also be considered scalable. This type of attack would be costed
> as "Scalable with physical access."
>
> A scalable attack may also be performed remotely by fooling a merchant
> into clicking links or installing malicious application and providing
> the needed privileges to that application. This would be costed as
> "Remotely scalable."
>
> Scalability of an attack could depend on the control of the COTS
> device (rooted device) if that step is required for the full attack.

### Knowledge of the A&M Back-end Systems

> The back-end attestation and monitoring (A&M) is a critical component
> of the overall software tamper-responsive system. This component is
> especially critical in a software-based payment, where depending on
> security and risk management policies, the monitoring system may
> terminate the payment transaction capability of any MPoC Application
> instance immediately when there are signs that the COTS device may be
> compromised. The knowledge of the attestation and monitoring (A&M) can
> be critical for performing certain attacks. It includes information on
> its capabilities and behavior, possibly including the anomaly
> detection algorithms used to interpret the various attestation data
> that comes from the MPoC Application. Identified levels are as
> follows:

-   **Public information** about the back-end monitoring system (or no
    > information): Information is considered public if it can be easily
    > obtained by anyone (e.g., from the Internet) or if it is provided
    > by the vendor to any customer.

-   **Restricted information** concerning the back-end monitoring system
    > (e.g., as gained from vendor technical specifications):
    > Information is considered restricted if it is distributed on

-   **Sensitive information** about the back-end monitoring
    > system---e.g., knowledge of internal design, which may have to be
    > obtained by "social engineering" or exhaustive
    > reverse-engineering.

### Equipment

> Attackers may require the use of equipment in the execution of some
> attack vectors. The type of equipment required to execute an attack
> vector will determine the attack cost associated. The two levels are:

-   **Standard SW/only** includes pre-existing tools which can be easily
    > obtained, such as Frida, Magisk, or jail-breaking scripts and
    > procedures.

-   **Specialized equipment** includes special software that is not
    > readily available and has to be created.

> The COTS device security, including the acceptability of any hardware
> used in the MPoC Solution, is the responsibility of the MPoC Solution
> provider and their risk management system. Hardware-based security
> relies on the fact that such solutions have passed high assurance
> security assessments. The risk management system as well as methods
> used to determine the acceptability of any hardware security level is
> assessed by the MPoC laboratory with the documentation assessment
> based on the relevant security certification as listed in the
> requirements of this document. Therefore, hardware attacks themselves
> and hardware equipment used for such attacks are out of scope of this
> rating system.

### COTS Device Access and Remote Attacks

> While some attack vectors require only remote access to the COTS
> device, other attack vectors require local levels of COTS device
> access. This attack cost factor considers attack vectors that require
> varying degrees of access to the physical COTS device under attack.
>
> Remote attacks for fully patched platforms are rare and require
> significant effort and skills. Unpatched systems as well as possible
> zero- day vulnerabilities could facilitate remote attacks. Zero-day
> vulnerabilities that provide remote access to the platform are
> difficult to find for the whole community, let alone for a laboratory
> during the time of the evaluation. Such attack chains are either very
> difficult to find and require a lot of time or the expertise to
> develop attack chains is not readily available.
>
> The unpatched systems have vulnerabilities that are publicly available
> and it is the responsibility of the evaluation laboratory to assess
> the effort of implementing the exploit depending on the type of
> vulnerabilities as shown in the example ratings within this section.
> Use or support of unpatched systems can be expected to lead to reduced
> time, expertise, or increased scalability for an attack -- potentially
> reducing attack ratings to an unacceptable level.
>
> The assessment should consider recently disclosed vulnerabilities,
> which may lead to potential attacks. It is a requirement of this
> standard that the A&M systems are constantly updated to monitor for
> and/or address vulnerabilities that could affect the security of the
> payment process.
>
> Three types of access are identified:

-   Remote -- where no physical access is required.

-   Local locked -- where physical access is required, but the device
    may be in a locked state.

-   Local unlocked -- where physical access with the device in an
    unlocked state is required.

## Discussion of Ratings with Examples

> In this section, we present the theoretical attacks of different types
> and considerations. The attack costing examples show how the
> assessment of an MPoC Product may differ based on the strength,
> scalability, and modality (local/remote) of the attack. These costings
> are provided as examples only and are not necessarily indicative of
> all costing possibilities for solutions that meet the high-level
> criteria provided.
>
> The examples provided include the following types of MPoC Solutions:

-   A relatively weak MPoC Solution with a scalable attack and one that
    prevents a scalable attack.

-   A relatively strong MPoC Solution with a scalable attack and
    non-scalable attack.

-   An MPoC Solution where there is the ability to use legitimate
    functionality provided by the COTS OS to expose account data, in
    both remote and non-remote attack modes.

### Example of a Weak Solution

> An example of a weak solution has the following evaluation results:

-   Weak attestation functions (bypass possible).

-   Lack of obfuscation.

-   Successful dynamic binary instrumentation (requiring rooted COTS
    > device), which leads to payment assets disclosure.

-   Available remote exploit for several approved platforms as well as
    > possibility for merchant and merchant employee to root the COTS
    > device without being detected by the backend.

> The relevant parameters of this attack if it were scalable are:

### Example of a Strong Solution - Scalable and non-Scalable Examples

> An example of a strong solution has the following evaluation results:

-   It takes an expert 2-3 weeks or more to reverse engineer the
    > solution and circumvent the runtime security mechanisms.

-   Obfuscation is very good.

-   Rooting is not detected (or rooting detections can be easily
    circumvented). The relevant parameters of this attack (for a

### Use and Abuse of Legitimate Functionality Provided by OS

> Different attacks exist that use legitimate functionality provided by
> the OS to gain access to MPoC assets. Examples of such attacks include
> TeaBot, Cloak, or Dagger using an overlay function as well as
> accessibility services or developer controls. This example including
> rating indicates how laboratories should approach such risks during
> the evaluation.
>
> An example of an abuse of legitimate functionality attack has the
> following evaluation results:

-   Merchant security-guidance documents (user guidance) do not prevent
    > merchant, employees, or attackers from installing a malicious
    > application to monitor touch events, turn on developer options,
    > give the malicious application logging privileges, and run
    > applications in the background.

-   The attestation and monitoring mechanism does not provide sufficient
    > information about:

    -   The applications that can monitor touch events.

    -   Whether the developer options are turned on.

    -   Whether malicious applications are running in the background.

-   The attack is scalable either in the sense that:

    -   Anyone can access and perform these actions on the COTS that
        runs the application, deeming this attack scalable in the sense
        of simplified activities that can be performed on multiple
        sites.

    -   The attack can be performed remotely by fooling a merchant into
        installing malicious application and providing the needed
        privileges.

## Detailed Examples

> This section provides rating examples for two attacks to support the
> laboratory in rating full attack paths based on its assessment of
> solution components and construction of the full attack from there.
> Although rating of a full attack on a platform cannot be tested within
> the scope of the MPoC evolution, the attack shows the effort needed,
> as well as the rating that such an attack would receive. Managing
> risks of attacks on the COTS platforms is handled by the MPoC Solution
> vendor risk-management system as assessed with this program. The
> second example is based on testing activities within the scope of this
> program.

### Example of Attack on a Platform - Full Attack - Remote Attack on Platform

> ***Note**: The attack activities are out of scope for testing
> activities within MPoC evaluation process*
>
> The first example describes the attack on the platform that cannot be
> identified during the MPoC Application assessment by the laboratory.
> Nevertheless, this attack is included to provide insight into the
> effort needed for such attacks and show the rating approach. The risk
> of the remote attacks on the platform should be addressed by the MPoC
> Solution provider process that manages risks.
>
> The full attack described here could lead to payment assets disclosure
> by gaining full control of the platform and assuming the MPoC
> Application is weak and trusts the COTS platform. The attack is based
> on the real-world attack presented by Samuel Groß (@5aelo), Project
> Zero in *Full remote attack based on No Clicks Required - Exploiting
> Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Messenger Apps*.
>
> This attack describes what is required to gain remote access and
> privilege escalation on a platform without known vulnerabilities. The
> attack description is publicly available.
>
> **Attack description:** The steps of the attack are:

1.  **Reverse engineering**: A researcher starts with the exploration of
    > the MPoC Application structure and protection measures. Sometimes
    > this knowledge is ported from the community. After extracting the
    > contents of the MPoC Application and exploring it, the researcher
    > finds a vulnerability in the NSUnarchiver API that can be
    > triggered without interaction via iMessage, which includes a
    > Shared key dictionary. The vulnerability is registered as
    > CVE-2019-8641 and it is a type of confusion attack.

2.  **Understanding platform protection**: The researcher analyzed the
    > solution to identify attack countermeasures. The first
    > countermeasure included separating data and execution parts of the
    > memory and preventing writing in execution parts. However, it
    > would be possible to use existing functions and build
    > return-oriented programming by storing pointers to functions
    > instead. To prevent this attack path, the mitigation techniques of
    > ASLR, Pointer Authentication (PAC), and Code signing have been
    > introduced. The ASLR or address space layout randomization is a
    > countermeasure to prevent return-oriented programming and prevent
    > jumping to predefined addresses. Pointer authentication is present
    > to prevent return-oriented programming. It uses a tag in a pointer
    > to sign and verify pointers.

3.  **Building an exploit**: To exploit the vulnerability, the
    > researcher must overcome ASLR as well as PAC. ASLR is overcome by
    > heap spraying with pointers and PAC is handled by creating fake
    > instances of legitimate classes. At this point, the researcher has
    > access to data and camera, and can run code outside the sandbox.

4.  **Privilege escalation**: The next step is "borrowed" from another
    > researcher (published exploit) and consists of expanding the
    > existing attack with the kernel exploit SockPuppet (CVE-2019-8605
    > from JavaScript), which has not been patched. This stage of the
    > attack provides access to platform hardware, FS, disabling of code
    > signing, hiding malware, etc.

5.  **Conclusion**: At the final stage, the attacker has full control
    > over the platform. For a MPoC Application in the COTS device that
    > suffers such a breach, the payment assets could be available in
    > memory or by developing additional code to tailor the attack to
    > access the COTS-native NFC and send the card data to a remote
    > server.

> **Comments and rating process**. Discovering the parts of this attack,
> as some parts have been borrowed from other experts, took about 1-to-2
> people approximately 3 months. Despite the long identification time,
> the scalability of the attack indicates it is a lucrative pursuit for
> attackers. Because the attack is available publicly, if the MPoC
> Application would support a vulnerable platform, it would be weak
> against memory dumping and instrumentation, and the A&M would not
> detect the version and prevent the MPoC Application from working. As a
> result, the tester would have to rate the attack.

### Example - Full Attack - Perform Fake Payments

> This attack describes what is required to perform faked payments for a
> specific MPoC Application with several security measures that have
> been shown to provide limited resistance during laboratory testing.
>
> **Attack description**. An attacker with MPoC Application control can
> modify the MPoC Application to simulate payments when the attacker
> card is detected. The attacker can acquire goods at the attacked
> merchant and the screen of the COTS device being used will behave
> normally, displaying the expected information on the screen; however,
> it will not send the payment to the backend. A merchant with enough
> transactions per day will probably identify the theft as shoplifting,
> as it leaves no trace in the system.
>
> The steps of the attack are:

6.  **Rooting the COTS device**. Older Android versions can run the MPoC
    > Application based on the policy of the MPoC Solution. Therefore,
    > the rooting of a COTS device can be performed with standard
    > tooling by unlocking the bootloader and installing a public
    > rootkit. The attestation system does not detect this partial
    > attack.

> The relevant parameters of this partial attack are:

-   **Elapsed time**: \<1 day

-   **Attacker Expertise**: Laymen

-   **Scalability**: scalable

-   **Knowledge of** A&M **backend**: N/A

-   **Equipment**: Standard software

-   **COTS device access**: local locked

7.  **Running an MPoC Application on a rooted COTS device**. It is
    > possible to run the MPoC Application on a rooted COTS device as
    > anti-instrumentation. Anti-debugging can be circumvented due to
    > the following weakness found during the evaluation:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  **Circumventing runtime protection**. It was identified that runtime
    protection is limited to some parts of the code, leaving the
    possibility for the attacker to modify the unprotected code flow
    relevant for this attack.

b.  **Sensitive information is logged**. The current state of the
    execution flow of the MPoC Application reveals information such as
    messages from security components and the current state of the
    execution flow. This information can aid in attacking the MPoC
    Application flow.

c.  **Monitoring system**. It is possible to circumvent the
    anti-instrumentation because no information is sent to the backend
    about the MPoC Application being compromised. It is possible to
    perform the transaction after the Frida instrumentation script was

> ported. The back-end system does not show any reactions caused by the
> compromise of the MPoC Application or COTS device. User-specific
> information was not removed from the phone due to the compromise.
>
> The relevant parameters of this partial attack are:

-   **Elapsed time**: \<1 week

-   **Attacker Expertise**: Proficient

-   **Scalability**: scalable

-   **Knowledge of** A&M **backend**: N/A

-   **Equipment**: Standard software

-   **COTS device access**: local locked

    1.  **Developing exploit**. Because the obfuscation and run-time
        > integrity are found to be weak during the evaluation, the
        > development of an exploit that modifies the code flow could be
        > performed.

> Circumventing the obfuscation and developing the exploit would require
> the following parameters:

-   **Elapsed time**: \>1 week

-   **Attacker Expertise**: Expert

-   **Scalability**: scalable

-   **Knowledge of** A&M **backend**: N/A

-   **Equipment**: Standard software

-   **COTS device access**: local locked

> Therefore, the full attack would have the following rating:

-   The elapsed time for identification is accumulated for all the steps
    > resulting in the attack time below a month.

-   The elapsed time for exploitation considers only the activities that
    must be repeated for other COTS devices with the same platform \<1
    day.

-   For all other categories, the highest necessary rating is considered
    because it is the minimum for the full attack to be completed. For
    example, if one partial attack requires expert while the rest of the
    partial attacks require only proficient, the full attack cannot be
    completed without an expert.

-   For exploitation, only the activities that must be repeated are
    considered in the rating. The steps of the attack are costed in a
    full attack table below:

## Equivalent Key Sizes

> Key-encipherment keys are to be at least of equal or greater strength
> than any key they protect. This applies to any key-encipherment keys
> used to protect secret or private keys that are stored, keys used to
> encrypt any secret, or private keys for loading or transport. For
> purposes of this requirement, the algorithms and key sizes in each row
> are considered equivalent. In [Table
> 8](#table-8-equivalent-key-sizes):

-   RSA key size refers to the size of the modulus.

-   Elliptic Curve key size refers to the minimum order of the base
    point on the elliptic curve. This order is to be slightly smaller
    than the field size.

-   DSA key sizes refer to the size of the modulus and the minimum size
    of a large subgroup.

For implementations using Diffie-Hellman (DH) or Elliptic Curve
Diffie-Hellman (ECDH):

-   DH implementations entities must generate and distribute the
    system-wide parameters securely: generator g, prime number p and
    parameter q, the large prime factor of (p - 1). Parameter p must be
    at least 2048 bits long and parameter q must be at least 224 bits
    long. Each entity must generate a private key x and a public key y
    using the domain parameters (p, q, g).

-   ECDH implementations entities must securely generate and distribute
    the system-wide parameters. Entities may generate the elliptic curve
    domain parameters or use a recommended curve (see FIPS186-4). The
    elliptic curve specified by the domain parameters must at least be
    as secure as P-224. Each entity must generate a private key d and a
    public key Q using the specified elliptic curve domain parameters.
    (See FIPS 186-4 for methods of generating d and Q.)

-   Each private key is to be statistically unique, unpredictable, and
    created using an approved Random Number Generator (RNG), as
    described in this document. See *[Table
    10](#table-10-random-number-generators)* for more information.

-   Entities are to authenticate the DH or ECDH public keys using DSA,
    ECDSA, a certificate, or a symmetric MAC (see *ISO 16609 -- Banking
    --Requirements for message authentication using symmetric
    techniques*). One of the following should be used:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   MAC algorithm 1 using padding method 3

-   MAC algorithm 5 using padding method 4

> TLS implementations are used to prevent using cipher suites that do
> not enforce the use of cryptographic ciphers, hash functions, and key
> lengths as outlined in this appendix.
>
> KCVs are values used to identify a key without revealing any bits of
> the actual key itself. Some check values are computed by encrypting an
> all-zero block using the key or component as the encryption key by

> The key length of a key or component will be MAC'd using the AES block

> while AES-256 uses 256).

# Appendix D Secure Software Lifecycle Requirements

> This appendix provides a baseline of security requirements with
> corresponding assessment procedures and guidance to help software
> vendors that design, develop, and maintain secure software used in the
> solution throughout the software lifecycle. Vendor's commitment to
> building capability to develop and maintain secure software is
> demonstrated by either:

-   Evaluation per Appendix D by an approved MPoC Laboratory as part of
    its evaluation, or

-   Through an independent assessment of software lifecycle management
    practices assessed by a Secure SLC Assessment performed by a Secure
    SLC Assessor (listed on the PCI SSC website) and confirmed by
    submitting a Secure SLC ROC and Secure SLC AOC.

## Leveraging PCI Secure SLC Standard for Appendix D Security Requirements

> The SSF Secure SLC Standard defines security requirements for
> payment-software vendors to integrate security throughout the entire
> software lifecycle, resulting in software that is secure by design and
> better able to withstand attacks. Software vendors whose development
> processes have been validated as meeting the Secure SLC Standard are
> listed on the PCI SSC website as a Secure SLC Qualified Vendor.
>
> It is possible to validate compliance to the security requirements in
> this appendix by confirming that the following are met:

-   The software lifecycle management practices were assessed by a
    Secure SLC Assessor and confirmed to meet all requirements in the
    Secure SLC Standard with the results documented in a Secure SLC ROC
    and Secure SLC AOC.

-   The software was developed and is being maintained using the
    software lifecycle management practices that were covered by the
    Secure SLC assessment.

-   A full Secure SLC assessment of the software lifecycle management
    practices was completed within the previous 36 months. Additionally,
    if the most recent full Secure SLC assessment occurred more than 12
    months ago, an Annual attestation was provided by the
    developer/vendor within the previous 12 months that confirms
    continued adherence to Secure SLC Standard for the software
    lifecycle management practices in use.

## Software Security Governance

> A formal software security governance program is established to
> reflect the vendor's commitment to build secure software, and protect
> any sensitive assets and resources stored, processed, or transmitted
> by that software.

# Appendix E MSR Security Requirements

> This appendix provides the security requirements for any non-PTS
> approved MSR devices used with an MPoC Solution. The security and
> testing requirements described in this appendix provide a framework
> for protecting the confidentiality and integrity of account data
> captured using a non-PTS approved MSR, used in combination with the
> existing elements of an overall MPoC Solution. Adding optional support
> to process magnetic stripe transactions with a magnetic stripe only
> reader allows merchants to use a single solution to accept payments,
> where magnetic stripe acceptance is desired but the PCI PTS SCRP
> device used with the MPoC Solution does not support MSR functionality.
>
> Only requirements for the non-PTS approved MSR device itself are
> covered in this Appendix. Requirements for the integration and use of
> a non-PTS approved MSR device within an overall MPoC Solution are
> covered within the MPoC requirements listed in the body of this
> document.

## MSR Validation and Testing Requirements

> Magnetic stripe data input to an MPoC Solution must be read by an
> approved device. This device may be a PCI PTS SCRP, tested and
> approved through the PCI PTS POI program, or a non-PTS approved MSR
> tested according to the requirements in this appendix. Regardless of
> validation, magnetic stripe-based transactions may not be used by an
> MPoC Solution with PIN acceptance.
>
> Many of the testing requirements in this appendix are based on, and
> reference, the PCI PTS POI v6.x Derived Test Requirements document.
> However, this appendix references only a subset of the requirements
> that would be tested against a PCI PTS SCRP device and exclude all
> physical security testing requirements. When the PCI PTS POI testing
> requirements require testing for data or implementations that are not
> provided by the MSR device -- such as PIN acceptance and processing,
> or physical security -- these requirements are not to be assessed.

# Appendix F Configuration and Use of the STS Tool

> The NIST STS (Statistical Test Suite) is a reference implementation of
> the statistical tests described in NIST SP 800-22 Revision 1a.
>
> The tester shall use NIST\'s STS tool, version 2.1.2 or later, or its
> mathematical equivalent. The tester shall verify that the compiled
> instance of the STS tool is operating correctly on the testing device
> by testing the NIST-provided sample data and comparing the results
> with those found in NIST SP 800-22 Revision 1a (SP800-22r1a), Appendix
> B. This configuration guidance is for use with STS version 2.1.2,
> though it will likely continue to be applicable to future versions.
>
> The tester should request and obtain a sample of 2^30^ bits from the
> vendor. The tester should exercise care to verify that the
> vendor-supplied data is interpreted correctly by the STS tool (the STS
> tool assumes that binary data is in big-endian formatting on all
> devices).
>
> The STS testing on the data shall be judged as a \"pass\" if it passes
> all of the tests, for both the \"Proportion of Sequences Passing a
> Test\" interpretation approach and \"Uniform Distribution of
> P-Values\" interpretation approach. If the data does not pass all
> tests, and the failure is marginal, the tester should acquire
> additional data from the vendor and repeat the testing, including both
> the initial data and the additional vendor-supplied data.
>
> The STS tool should be configured as per guidance provided in SP
> 800-22 Revision 1a, which is summarized on the next page.
>
> The following settings are consistent with the SP 800-22 Revision 1a
> document:

|               |        | requires n to equal 106. (See SP 800-22r1a |

|               |        | Section 4.2.1.) This value will be 1,073   |
|               |        | for the first test, but any additional     |
|               |        | testing (e.g., further testing to resolve  |
|               |        | test failures) will necessarily include    |

|               |        | should be set to at least 284 prior to     |
