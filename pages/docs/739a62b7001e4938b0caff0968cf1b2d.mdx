## Preface

The fourth edition of *Current Essentials of Medicine* (originally
titled *Essentials of Diagnosis & Treatment*) continues a feature
introduced in the second edition: a Clinical Pearl for each diagnosis.
Pearls are time- less. Learners at every level, and in many countries,
remember them as crucial adjuncts to more detailed information about
disorders of every type. Ideally, a Pearl is succinct, witty, and often
colloquial; it is stated with a certitude suggesting 100% accuracy. Of
course, nothing in med- icine is so, yet a Pearl such as "If you
diagnose multiple sclerosis over the age of ﬁfty, diagnose something
else" is easily committed to memory. Thus, Pearls should be accepted as
offered. Many have been changed since the previous editions, and we urge
readers to come up with Pearls of their own, which may prove to be more
useful than our own.

The fourth edition, like its predecessors, uses a single page to con-
sider each disease, providing the reader with a concise yet usable sum-
mary about most of the common diseases seen in clinical practice. For
readers seeking more detailed information, a current reference has been
provided for each disease. We have expanded the number of diseases from
the previous edition and updated the clinical manifestations, diag-
nostic tests, and treatment considerations with the help of our con-
tributing subject-matter experts.

We hope that you enjoy this edition as much as, if not more than, the
previous ones.

## Cardiovascular Diseases

####  Acute Coronary Syndrome 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Classiﬁed as ST-segment elevation (Q wave) myocardial infarction
        (MI), non--ST-segment elevation (non-Q wave) MI, or unstable
        angina

    -   Prolonged (\> 30 minutes) chest pain, associated with shortness
        of breath, nausea, left arm or neck pain, and diaphoresis; can
        be painless in diabetics

    -   S~4~ common; S~3~, mitral insufﬁciency on occasion

    -   Cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias may complicate

    -   Unrelenting chest pain may mean ongoing jeopardized myocardium

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Stable angina; aortic dissection; pulmonary emboli

    -   Tietze's syndrome (costochondritis)

    -   Cervical or thoracic radiculopathy, including pre-eruptive
        zoster

    -   Esophageal spasm or reﬂux; cholecystitis

    -   Pericarditis; myocarditis; Takotsubo's (stress-induced)
        cardiomy- opathy

    -   Pneumococcal pneumonia; pneumothorax

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Monitoring, oxygen, aspirin, oral beta-blockers, and heparin if
        not contraindicated; consider clopidogrel

    -   Reperfusion by thrombolysis early or percutaneous coronary
        inter- vention (PCI) in selected patients with either ST-segment
        eleva- tion or new left bundle-branch block on ECG

    -   Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors considered for ST-segment ele-
        vation MI in patients undergoing PCI

    -   Nitroglycerin and morphine for recurrent ischemic pain; also
        useful for relieving pulmonary congestion, decreasing sympa-
        thetic tone, and reducing blood pressure

    -   Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II
        receptor blockers, and aldosterone blockers such as eplerenone
        improve ventricular remodeling after infarcts

-   ##### Pearl

####  1 Acute Pericarditis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Inﬂammation of the pericardium due to viral infection, drugs,
        > recent myocardial infarction, autoimmune syndromes, renal
        > fail- ure, cardiac surgery, trauma, or neoplasm

    -   Common symptoms include pleuritic chest pain radiating to the
        > shoulder (trapezius ridge) and dyspnea; pain improves with
        > sit- ting up and expiration

    -   Examination may reveal fever, tachycardia, and an intermittent
        > friction rub; cardiac tamponade may occur in any patient

    -   Electrocardiography usually shows PR depression, diffuse concave
        > ST-segment elevation followed by T-wave inversions; no recip-
        > rocal changes are seen

    -   Echocardiography may reveal pericardial effusion

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Acute myocardial infarction

    -   Aortic dissection

    -   Pulmonary embolism

    -   Pneumothorax

    -   Pneumonia

    -   Cholecystitis and pancreatitis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory agents such as ibupro-
        > fen or indomethacin to relieve symptoms; colchicine has been
        > shown to reduce recurrence; rarely, steroids for recurrent
        > cases

    -   Hospitalization for patients with symptoms suggestive of signif-
        > icant effusions, cardiac tamponade, elevated biomarkers, or
        > recent trauma or surgery

-   ##### Pearl

> *Patients with pericarditis often present with chest pain that is
> worse when lying ﬂat.*

####  Acute Rheumatic Fever 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   A systemic immune process complicating group A beta-hemolytic
        streptococcal pharyngitis

    -   Usually affects children between the ages of 5 and 15; rare
        after 25

    -   Occurs 1--5 weeks after throat infection

    -   Diagnosis based on Jones' criteria (two major or one major and
        two minor) and conﬁrmation of recent streptococcal infection

    -   Major criteria: Erythema marginatum, migratory polyarthritis,
        subcutaneous nodules, carditis, and Sydenham's chorea; the
        latter is the most speciﬁc, least sensitive

    -   Minor criteria: Fever, arthralgias, elevated erythrocyte
        sedimen- tation rate, elevated C-reactive protein, PR
        prolongation on ECG, and history of pharyngitis

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Juvenile or adult rheumatoid arthritis

    -   Endocarditis

    -   Osteomyelitis

    -   Systemic lupus erythematosus

    -   Lyme disease

    -   Disseminated gonococcal infection

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Bed rest until vital signs and ECG become normal

    -   Salicylates and nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs reduce fever
        and joint complaints but do not affect the natural course of the
        dis- ease; rarely, corticosteroids may be used

    -   If streptococcal infection is still present, penicillin is
        indicated

    -   Prevention of recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis until 18 years
        old (a monthly injection of benzathine penicillin is most
        commonly used)

-   ##### Pearl

> *Inappropriate tachycardia in a febrile child with a recent sore
> throat sug- gests this diagnosis.*

####  1 Angina Pectoris 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Generally caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and
        > severe coronary obstruction; cigarette smoking, diabetes
        > mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and family
        > history are estab- lished risk factors

    -   Stable angina characterized by pressure-like episodic precordial
        > chest discomfort, precipitated by exertion or stress, relieved
        > by rest or nitrates; unstable angina can occur with less
        > exertion or at rest

    -   Stable angina is predictable in initiation and termination;
        > unstable angina is not

    -   S~4~, S~3~, mitral murmur, paradoxically split S~2~ may occur
        > transiently with pain

    -   Electrocardiography usually normal between episodes (or may show
        > evidence of old infarction); electrocardiography with pain may
        > show evidence of ischemia, classically ST depression

    -   Diagnosis from history and stress tests; conﬁrmed by coronary
        > arteriography

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Other coronary syndromes (myocardial infarction, vasospasm)

    -   Tietze's syndrome (costochondritis)

    -   Intercostal neuropathy, especially caused by herpes zoster

    -   Cervical or thoracic radiculopathy, including pre-eruptive
        > zoster

    -   Esophageal spasm or reﬂux disease; cholecystitis

    -   Pneumothorax; pulmonary embolism; pneumonia

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Address risk factors; sublingual nitroglycerin for episodes

    -   Ongoing treatment includes aspirin, long-acting nitrates, beta-
        > blockers, and calcium channel blockers

    -   Angioplasty with stenting considered in patients with
        > anatomically suitable stenoses who remain symptomatic on
        > medical therapy

    -   Bypass grafting for patients with refractory angina on medical
        > therapy, three-vessel disease (or two-vessel disease with
        > proximal left anterior descending artery disease) and
        > decreased left ven- tricular function, or left main coronary
        > artery disease

####  Aortic Coarctation 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Elevated blood pressure in the aortic arch and its branches with
        reduced blood pressure distal to the left subclavian artery

    -   Lower extremity claudication or leg weakness with exertion in
        young adults is characteristic

    -   Systolic blood pressure is higher in the arms than in the legs,
        but diastolic pressure is similar compared with radial

    -   Femoral pulses delayed and decreased, with pulsatile collaterals
        in the intercostal areas; a harsh, late systolic murmur may be
        heard in the back; an aortic ejection murmur suggests concomi-
        tant bicuspid aortic valve

    -   Electrocardiography with left ventricular hypertrophy; chest
        x-ray may show rib notching inferiorly due to collaterals

    -   Transesophageal echo with Doppler or MRI is diagnostic; angiog-
        raphy conﬁrms gradient across the coarctation

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Essential hypertension

    -   Renal artery stenosis

    -   Renal parenchymal disease

    -   Pheochromocytoma

    -   Mineralocorticoid excess

    -   Oral contraceptive use

    -   Cushing's syndrome

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Surgery is the mainstay of therapy; balloon angioplasty in
        selected patients

    -   Twenty-ﬁve percent of patients remain hypertensive after surgery

-   ##### Pearl

> should suggest this problem; listen to the back for the characteristic
> murmur.*

####  1 Aortic Dissection 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Most patients between age 50 and 70; risks include hypertension,
        > Marfan's syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the
        > aorta, and pregnancy

    -   Type A involves the ascending aorta or arch; type B does not

    -   Sudden onset of chest pain with interscapular radiation in
        > at-risk patient

    -   Unequal blood pressures in upper extremities, new diastolic
        > murmur of aortic insufﬁciency occasionally seen in type A

    -   Chest x-ray nearly always abnormal; ECG unimpressive unless
        > coronary artery compromised

    -   CT, transesophageal echocardiography, MRI, or aortography usu-
        > ally diagnostic

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Acute myocardial infarction

    -   Angina pectoris

    -   Acute pericarditis

    -   Pneumothorax

    -   Pulmonary embolism

    -   Boerhaave's syndrome

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Nitroprusside and beta-blockers to lower systolic blood pressure
        > to approximately 100 mm Hg, pulse to 60/min

    -   Emergent surgery for type A dissection; medical therapy for type
        > B is reasonable, with surgery or percutaneous intra-aortic
        > stenting reserved for high-risk patients

####  Aortic Regurgitation 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Causes include congenital bicuspid valve, endocarditis,
        rheumatic heart disease, Marfan's syndrome, aortic dissection,
        ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, and syphilis

    -   Acute aortic regurgitation: Abrupt onset of pulmonary edema

    -   Chronic aortic regurgitation: Asymptomatic until middle age,
        when symptoms of left heart failure develop insidiously

    -   Soft, high-pitched, decrescendo holodiastolic murmur in chronic
        aortic regurgitation; occasionally, an accompanying apical low-
        pitched diastolic rumble (Austin Flint murmur) in nonrheumatic
        patients; in acute aortic regurgitation, the diastolic murmur
        can be short (or not even heard) and harsh

    -   Acute aortic regurgitation: Reduced S~1~ and an S~3~; rales

    -   Chronic aortic regurgitation: Reduced S~1~, wide pulse pressure,
        water- hammer pulse, subungual capillary pulsations (Quincke's
        sign), rapid rise and fall of pulse (Corrigan's pulse), and a
        diastolic murmur over a partially compressed femoral artery

    -   ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy

    -   Echo Doppler conﬁrms diagnosis, estimates severity

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Pulmonary hypertension with Graham Steell murmur

    -   Mitral, or rarely, tricuspid stenosis

    -   Left ventricular failure due to other cause

    -   Dock's murmur of left anterior descending artery stenosis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Vasodilators (eg, nifedipine and ACE inhibitors) do not delay
        the progression to valve replacement in patients with mild to
        moder- ate aortic regurgitation

    -   In chronic aortic regurgitation, surgery reserved for patients
        with symptoms or ejection function \< 50% on echocardiography

    -   Acute regurgitation caused by aortic dissection or endocarditis
        requires surgical replacement of the valve

####  1 Aortic Stenosis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Causes include congenital bicuspid valve and progressive calci-
        > ﬁcation with aging of a normal three-leaﬂet valve; rheumatic
        > fever rarely, if ever, causes isolated aortic stenosis

    -   Dyspnea, angina, and syncope singly or in any combination;
        > sudden death in less than 1% of asymptomatic patients

    -   Weak and delayed carotid pulses (pulsus parvus et tardus); a
        > soft, absent, or paradoxically split S~2~; a harsh
        > diamond-shaped sys- tolic ejection murmur to the right of the
        > sternum, often radiating to the neck, but on occasion heard
        > apically (Gallavardin's phe- nomenon)

    -   Left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG and chest x-ray may show
        > calciﬁcation in the aortic valve

    -   Echo conﬁrms diagnosis and estimates valve area and gradient;
        > cardiac catheterization conﬁrms severity if there is
        > discrepancy between physical exam and echo; concomitant
        > coronary athero- sclerotic disease present in 50%

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Mitral regurgitation

    -   Hypertrophic obstructive or dilated cardiomyopathy

    -   Atrial or ventricular septal defect

    -   Syncope due to other causes

    -   Ischemic heart disease without valvular abnormality

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Surgery is indicated for all patients with severe aortic
        > stenosis (mean aortic valve gradient \> 40 mm Hg or valve area
        > ≤ 1.0 cm^2^) and the presence of symptoms or ejection fraction
        > \< 50%

    -   Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty for temporary (6 months)
        > relief of symptoms in poor surgical candidates

-   ##### Pearl

####  Atrial Fibrillation 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   The most common chronic arrhythmia

    -   Causes include mitral valve disease, hypertensive and ischemic
        heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, alcohol use,
        hyperthyroidism, peri- carditis, cardiac surgery; many
        idiopathic ("lone" atrial ﬁbrillation)

    -   Complications include precipitation of cardiac failure, arterial
        embolization

    -   Palpitations, dyspnea, chest pain; commonly asymptomatic

    -   Irregularly irregular heartbeat, variable intensity S~1~,
        occasional S~3~; S~4~ absent in all

    -   Electrocardiography shows ventricular rate of 80--170/min in
        untreated patients; if associated with an accessory pathway (ie,
        Wolff-Parkinson-White), the ventricular rate can be \> 200/min
        with wide QRS and antegrade conduction through the pathway

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Multifocal atrial tachycardia; sinus arrhythmia

    -   Atrial ﬂutter or tachycardia with variable block

    -   Normal sinus rhythm with multiple premature contractions

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Control ventricular response with AV-nodal blockers such as
        digoxin, beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker---choice depend-
        ing on contractile state of left ventricle and blood pressure

    -   Cardioversion in unstable patients with acute atrial
        ﬁbrillation; elective cardioversion in stable patients once a
        left atrial throm- bus has been ruled out or effectively treated

    -   Antiarrhythmic agents (eg, propafenone, procainamide,
        amiodarone, sotalol) for highly symptomatic patients despite
        rate control

    -   Chronic warfarin or aspirin in all patients

    -   With elective cardioversion, documented therapeutic anticoagu-
        lation for 4 weeks prior to the procedure unless transesophageal
        echocardiography excludes a left atrial thrombus; all patients
        require anticoagulation during and after cardioversion

    -   Radiofrequency ablation of pulmonary vein sources of atrial ﬁb-
        rillation increasingly used in symptomatic patients who fail
        antiar- rhythmic therapy

####  1 Atrial Flutter 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Common in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); also
        > seen in dilated cardiomyopathy, especially in alcoholics

    -   Atrial rate between 250 and 350 beats/min with every second,
        > third, or fourth impulse conducted by the ventricle; 2:1 most
        > common

    -   Patients may be asymptomatic, complain of palpitations, or have
        > evidence of congestive heart failure

    -   Flutter (*a*) waves visible in the neck in occasional patients

    -   Electrocardiography shows "sawtooth" P waves in V~1~ and the
        inferior leads; ventricular response usually regular; less com-
        monly, irregular due to variable atrioventricular block

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

> *With regular ventricular rate:*

-   Automatic atrial tachycardia

-   Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia

-   Atrioventricular reentry tachycardia with accessory pathway

-   Sinus tachycardia

> *With irregular ventricular rate:*

-   Atrial ﬁbrillation

-   Multifocal atrial tachycardia

-   Sinus rhythm with frequent premature atrial contractions

```
-   ##### Treatment

    -   Often spontaneously converts to atrial ﬁbrillation

    -   Electrical cardioversion is reliable and safe

    -   Conversion may also be achieved by drugs (eg, ibutilide)

    -   Risk of embolization is lower than for atrial ﬁbrillation, but
        > anti- coagulation still recommended

    -   Radiofrequency ablation is highly successful (\> 90%) in

####  Atrial Myxoma 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Most common cardiac tumor, usually originating in the
        interatrial septum, with 80% growing into the left atrium;
        5--10% bilateral

    -   Symptoms fall into one of three categories: (1)
        systemic---fever, malaise, weight loss; (2)
        obstructive---positional dyspnea and syncope; and (3)
        embolic---acute vascular or neurologic deﬁcit

    -   Diastolic "tumor plop" or mitral stenosis-like murmur; signs of
        congestive heart failure and systemic embolization in many

    -   Episodic pulmonary edema, classically when patient assumes an
        upright position

    -   Leukocytosis, anemia, accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation rate

    -   MRI or echocardiogram demonstrates tumor

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Subacute infective endocarditis

    -   Lymphoma

    -   Autoimmune disease

    -   Mitral stenosis

    -   Cor triatriatum

    -   Parachute mitral valve

####  1 Atrial Septal Defect 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Patients with small defects are usually asymptomatic and have a
        > normal life span

    -   Large shunts symptomatic by age 40, including exertional dysp-
        > nea, fatigue, and palpitations

    -   Paradoxical embolism may occur (ie, upper or lower extremity
        > venous thrombus embolizing to brain or extremity rather than
        > lung) with transient shunt reversal

    -   Right ventricular lift, widened and ﬁxed splitting of S~2~, and
        sys- tolic ﬂow murmur in the pulmonary area

    -   ECG may show right ventricular hypertrophy and right axis devi-
        > ation (in ostium secundum defects), left anterior hemiblock
        > (in ostium primum defects); complete or incomplete right
        > bundle- branch block in 95%

    -   Atrial ﬁbrillation commonly complicates

    -   Echo Doppler with agitated saline contrast injection is diagnos-
        > tic; radionuclide angiogram or cardiac catheterization
        > estimates ratio of pulmonary ﬂow to systemic ﬂow (Q~P~:Q~S~)

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Left ventricular failure

    -   Left-sided valvular disease

    -   Primary pulmonary hypertension

    -   Chronic pulmonary embolism

    -   Sleep apnea

    -   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

    -   Eisenmenger's syndrome

    -   Pulmonary stenosis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Small defects do not require surgical correction

    -   Surgery or percutaneous closure devices indicated for patients
        > with symptoms or Q~P~:Q~S~ \> 1.5

    -   Surgery contraindicated in patients with pulmonary hypertension

####  Atrioventricular Block 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   First-degree block: Delayed conduction at the level of the
        atrio- ventricular node; PR interval \> 0.20 seconds

    -   Second-degree block: Mobitz I---progressive prolongation of the
        PR interval and decreasing R-R interval prior to a blocked sinus
        impulse as well as "group beating"; Mobitz II---ﬁxed PR inter-
        vals before a beat is dropped

    -   Third-degree block: Complete block at or below the node; P waves
        and QRS complexes occur independently of one another, both at
        ﬁxed rates with atrial rate \> ventricular rate

    -   Clinical manifestations of third-degree block include chest
        pain, syncope, and shortness of breath; cannon *a* waves in neck
        veins; ﬁrst heart sound varies in intensity

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

> *Causes of ﬁrst-degree and Mobitz I atrioventricular block:*

-   Increased vagal tone

-   Drugs that prolong atrioventricular conduction

-   All causes of second- and third-degree block

> *Causes of Mobitz II and third-degree atrioventricular block:*

-   Chronic degenerative conduction system disease (Lev's and Lenègre's
    syndromes)

-   Acute myocardial infarction: Inferior myocardial infarction causes
    complete block at the node, anterior myocardial infarction below it

-   Acute myocarditis (eg, Lyme disease, viral myocarditis, rheu- matic
    fever)

-   Digitalis toxicity

-   Aortic valve abscess

-   Congenital

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ##### Treatment

    -   In symptomatic patients with Mobitz I, permanent pacing; asymp-
        tomatic patients with Mobitz I do not need therapy

    -   For some with Mobitz II and all with infranodal third-degree
        atri- oventricular block, permanent pacing unless a reversible
        cause (eg, drug toxicity, inferior myocardial infarction, Lyme
        disease) is present

####  1 Cardiac Tamponade 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Life-threatening disorder occurring when pericardial ﬂuid accu-
        > mulates under pressure; effusions rapidly increasing in size
        > may cause an elevated intrapericardial pressure (\> 15 mm Hg),
        > lead- ing to impaired cardiac ﬁlling and decreased cardiac
        > output

    -   Common causes include metastatic malignancy, uremia, viral or
        > idiopathic pericarditis, and cardiac trauma; however, any
        > cause of pericarditis can cause tamponade

    -   Clinical manifestations include dyspnea, cough, tachycardia,
        > hypotension, pulsus paradoxus, jugular venous distention, and
        > distant heart sounds

    -   Electrocardiography usually shows low QRS voltage and occa-
        > sionally electrical alternans; chest x-ray shows an enlarged
        > cardiac silhouette with a "water-bottle" conﬁguration if a
        > large (\> 250 mL) effu- sion is present---which it need not be
        > if effusion develops rapidly

    -   Echocardiography delineates effusion and its hemodynamic sig-
        > niﬁcance, eg, atrial collapse; cardiac catheterization conﬁrms
        > the diagnosis if equalization of diastolic pressures in all
        > four cham- bers occurs with loss of the normal *y* descent

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Tension pneumothorax

    -   Right ventricular infarction

    -   Severe left ventricular failure

    -   Constrictive pericarditis

    -   Restrictive cardiomyopathy

    -   Pneumonia with septic shock

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Immediate pericardiocentesis if hemodynamic compromise is noted

    -   Volume expansion until pericardiocentesis is performed

    -   Deﬁnitive treatment for reaccumulation may require surgical

####  Congestive Heart Failure 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Two pathophysiologic categories: Systolic dysfunction and dias-
        tolic dysfunction

    -   Systolic: The ability to pump blood is compromised; ejection
        fraction is decreased; causes include coronary artery disease,
        dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, "burned-out" hypertensive
        heart disease, and regurgitant valvular heart disease

    -   Diastolic: Heart unable to relax and allow adequate diastolic
        ﬁll- ing; normal ejection fraction; causes include ischemia,
        hyperten- sion with left ventricular hypertrophy, aortic
        stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive
        cardiomyopathy, and small-vessel disease (especially diabetes)

    -   Evidence of both common in the typical heart failure patient,
        but up to 50% of patients will have isolated diastolic
        dysfunction

    -   Symptoms and signs can result from left-sided failure,
        right-sided failure, or both

    -   Left ventricular failure: Exertional dyspnea, orthopnea,
        paroxys- mal nocturnal dyspnea, pulsus alternans, rales, gallop
        rhythm; pulmonary venous congestion on chest x-ray

    -   Right ventricular failure: Fatigue, malaise, elevated venous
        pres- sure, hepatomegaly, abdominojugular reﬂux, and dependent
        edema

    -   Diagnosis conﬁrmed by echo, pulmonary capillary wedge meas-
        urement, or elevated levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Constrictive pericarditis; nephrosis; cirrhosis

    -   Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism; beriberi

    -   Noncardiogenic causes of pulmonary edema

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Systolic dysfunction: Vasodilators (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin
        II receptor blockers, or combination of hydralazine and
        isosorbide dini- trate), beta-blockers, spironolactone, and
        low-sodium diet; for symp- toms, use diuretics and digoxin;
        anticoagulation perhaps in high-risk patients with apical
        akinesis even with sinus rhythm; look for ischemia, valvular
        disease, alcohol use, or hypothyroidism as causes

    -   Diastolic dysfunction: A negative inotrope (beta-blocker or
        calcium channel blocker), low-sodium diet, and diuretics for
        symptoms

####  1 Constrictive Pericarditis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   A thickened ﬁbrotic pericardium impairing cardiac ﬁlling and
        > decreasing cardiac output

    -   May follow tuberculosis, cardiac surgery, radiation therapy, or
        > viral, uremic, or neoplastic pericarditis

    -   Gradual onset of dyspnea, fatigue, weakness, pedal edema, and
        > abdominal swelling; right-sided heart failure symptoms often
        > pre- dominate, with ascites sometimes disproportionate to
        > pedal edema

    -   Physical examination reveals tachycardia, elevated jugular
        > venous dis- tention with rapid *y* descent, Kussmaul's sign,
        > hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, "pericardial knock" following
        > S~2~, and peripheral edema

    -   Pericardial calciﬁcation on chest ﬁlm in less than half;
        > electro- cardiography may show low QRS voltage; liver function
        > tests abnormal from passive congestion

    -   Echocardiography can demonstrate a thick pericardium and normal
        > left ventricular function; CT or MRI is more sensitive in
        > revealing pericardial pathology; cardiac catheterization
        > demon- strates ventricular discordance with respiration in
        > contrast to restrictive cardiomyopathy

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Cardiac tamponade

    -   Right ventricular infarction

    -   Restrictive cardiomyopathy

    -   Cirrhosis with ascites (most common misdiagnosis)

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Acute treatment usually includes gentle diuresis

    -   Deﬁnitive therapy is surgical stripping of the pericardium;
        > effec- tive in up to half of patients

    -   Evaluation for tuberculosis

####  Cor Pulmonale 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Heart failure resulting from pulmonary disease

    -   Most commonly due to COPD; other causes include pulmonary
        ﬁbrosis, pneumoconioses, recurrent pulmonary emboli, primary
        pulmonary hypertension, sleep apnea, and kyphoscoliosis

    -   Clinical manifestations are due to both the underlying pulmonary
        disease and the right ventricular failure

    -   Chest x-ray reveals an enlarged right ventricle and pulmonary
        artery; electrocardiography may show right axis deviation, right
        ventricular hypertrophy, and tall, peaked P waves (P pulmonale)
        in the face of low QRS voltage

    -   Pulmonary function tests usually conﬁrm the presence of
        underlying lung disease, and echocardiography will show right
        ventricular dilation but normal left ventricular function and
        elevated right ventricular systolic pressures

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

> *Other causes of right ventricular failure:*

-   Left ventricular failure (due to any cause)

-   Pulmonary stenosis

-   Left-to-right shunt causing Eisenmenger's syndrome

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ##### Treatment

    -   Treatment is primarily directed at the pulmonary process causing
        the right heart failure (eg, oxygen if hypoxia is present)

    -   In frank right ventricular failure, include salt restriction,
        diuret- ics, and oxygen

    -   For primary pulmonary hypertension, cautious use of vasodilators
        (calcium channel blockers) or continuous-infusion prostacyclin
        may beneﬁt some patients

####  1 Deep Venous Thrombosis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Dull pain or tight feeling in the calf or thigh

    -   Up to half of patients are asymptomatic in the early stages

    -   Increased risk: Congestive heart failure, recent major surgery,
        > neoplasia, oral contraceptive use by smokers, prolonged
        > inactivity, varicose veins, hypercoagulable states (eg,
        > protein C, protein S, other anticoagulant deﬁciencies,
        > nephrotic syndrome)

    -   Physical signs unreliable

    -   Doppler ultrasound and impedance plethysmography are initial
        > tests of choice (less sensitive in asymptomatic patients);
        > venog- raphy is deﬁnitive but difﬁcult to perform

    -   Pulmonary thromboembolism, especially with proximal, above-
        > the-knee deep vein thrombosis, is a life-threatening
        > complication

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Calf strain or contusion; ruptured Baker's cyst

    -   Cellulitis; lymphatic obstruction

    -   Congestive heart failure, especially right-sided

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Anticoagulation with heparin followed by oral warfarin for 3--6
        > months

    -   Subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin may be substituted for
        > intravenous heparin

    -   NSAIDs for associated pain and swelling

    -   For idiopathic and recurrent cases, hypercoagulable conditions
        > should be considered, although factor V Leiden should be
        > sought on a first episode without risk factors in patients of
        > European ethnicity

    -   Postphlebitic syndrome (chronic venous insufﬁciency) is common

####  Dilated Cardiomyopathy 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   A cause of systolic dysfunction, this represents a group of
        disor- ders that lead to congestive heart failure

    -   Symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure: Exertional dys-
        pnea, cough, fatigue, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, cardiac
        enlargement, rales, gallop rhythm, elevated venous pressure,
        hepatomegaly, and dependent edema

    -   Electrocardiography may show nonspeciﬁc repolarization abnor-
        malities and atrial or ventricular ectopy, but is not diagnostic

    -   Echocardiography reveals depressed contractile function and car-
        diomegaly

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Treat the underlying disorder when identiﬁable

    -   Abstention from alcohol and NSAIDs

    -   Routine management of systolic dysfunction, including with
        vasodilators (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers,
        and/or a combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate),
        beta-blockers, spironolactone, and low-sodium diet; digoxin and
        diuretics for symptoms

    -   Many empirically employ chronic warfarin if apical akinesis is
        noted

    -   In a patient with ischemic or nonischemic heart disease and a
        low left ventricular ejection fraction (\< 35%), an implantable
        cardiac deﬁbrillator (ICD) may be warranted even in the absence
        of doc- umented ventricular tachycardia

[]{#_bookmark22 .anchor} 1 **Hypertension**

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   In most patients (95% of cases), no cause can be found

    -   Chronic elevation in blood pressure (\> 140/90 mm Hg) occurs in
        > 23% of non-Hispanic white adults and 32% of non-Hispanic black
        > adults in the United States; onset is usually between ages 20
        > and 55

    -   The pathogenesis is multifactorial: Environmental, dietary,
        > genetic, and neurohormonal factors all contribute

    -   Most patients are asymptomatic; some, however, complain of
        > headache, epistaxis, or blurred vision if hypertension is
        > severe

    -   Most diagnostic study abnormalities are referable to "target
        > organ" damage: heart, kidney, brain, retina, and peripheral
        > arteries

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

> *Secondary causes of hypertension:*

-   Coarctation of the aorta

-   Renal insufﬁciency

-   Renal artery stenosis

-   Pheochromocytoma

-   Cushing's syndrome

-   Primary hyperaldosteronism

-   Chronic use of oral contraceptive pills or alcohol

```{=html}

```
-   ##### Treatment

    -   Decrease blood pressure with a single agent (if possible) while
        > minimizing side effects; however, those with blood pressure

> \> 160/100 may require combination therapy

-   Many recommend diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, or calcium
    > channel blockers as initial therapy, but considerable lat- itude
    > is allowed for individual patients; these agents can be used alone
    > or in combination; α1-blockers are considered second-line agents

####  Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Asymmetric myocardial hypertrophy causing dynamic obstruction to
        left ventricular outﬂow below the aortic valve

    -   Sporadic or dominantly inherited

    -   Obstruction is worsened by increasing left ventricular
        contractil- ity or decreasing ﬁlling

    -   Symptoms are dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope; a subgroup of
        younger patients is at high risk for sudden cardiac death (1%
        per year), especially with exercise

    -   Sustained, biﬁd (rarely triﬁd) apical impulse, S~4~

    -   Electrocardiography shows exaggerated septal Q waves sugges-
        tive of myocardial infarction; supraventricular and ventricular
        arrhythmias may also be seen

    -   Echocardiography with hypertrophy, evidence of dynamic obstruc-
        tion from abnormal systolic motion of the anterior mitral valve
        leaﬂet

    -   Role for genetic testing including familial screening, but
        current tests only identify 50--60% of mutations

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Hypertensive or ischemic heart disease

    -   Restrictive cardiomyopathy (eg, amyloidosis)

    -   Aortic stenosis; athlete's heart

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers are the initial drugs
        of choice in symptomatic patients

    -   Avoid afterload reducers such as ACE inhibitors

    -   Surgical myectomy, percutaneous transcoronary septal reduction
        with alcohol, or dual-chamber pacing is considered in some

    -   Implantable cardiac deﬁbrillator in patients at high risk for
        sudden death; risk factors include left ventricle thickness \>
        30 mm, family history of sudden death, nonsustained ventricular
        tachycardia on Holter, hypotensive blood pressure response on
        treadmill, previ- ous cardiac arrest, and syncope

    -   Natural history is unpredictable; sports requiring high cardiac
        output should be discouraged

    -   All ﬁrst-degree relatives should be evaluated with
        echocardiography every 5 years if \> 18 years of age; every year
        if \< 18 years of age

####  1 Mitral Regurgitation 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Causes include rheumatic heart disease, infectious endocarditis,
        > mitral valve prolapse, ischemic papillary muscle dysfunction,
        > torn chordae tendineae

    -   Acute: Immediate onset of symptoms of pulmonary edema

    -   Chronic: Asymptomatic for years, then exertional dyspnea and
        > fatigue

    -   S~1~ usually reduced; a blowing, high-pitched apical pansystolic
        > murmur increased by ﬁnger squeeze is characteristic; S~3~
        > common in chronic cases; murmur is not pansystolic and less
        > audible in acute

    -   Left atrial abnormality and often left ventricular hypertrophy
        > on ECG; atrial ﬁbrillation typical with chronicity

    -   Echo Doppler conﬁrms diagnosis, estimates severity

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Aortic stenosis or sclerosis

    -   Tricuspid regurgitation

    -   Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy

    -   Atrial septal defect

    -   Ventricular septal defect

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Acute mitral regurgitation due to endocarditis or torn chordae
        > may require immediate surgical repair

    -   Surgical repair or replacement for severe mitral regurgitation
        > in patients with symptoms, left ventricular dysfunction (eg,
        > ejection fraction \< 60%), or left ventricular systolic
        > dimension \> 40 mm

    -   There are no data supporting the use of vasodilators in patients
        > with asymptomatic chronic mitral regurgitation; digoxin,
        > beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers control
        > ventricular response with atrial ﬁbrillation, and warfarin
        > anticoagulation should be given

####  Mitral Stenosis 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Always caused by rheumatic heart disease, but 30% of patients
        have no history of rheumatic fever

    -   Dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, even hemop-
        tysis---often precipitated by volume overload (pregnancy, salt
        load) or tachycardia

    -   Right ventricular lift in many; opening snap occasionally
        palpable

    -   Crisp S~1~, increased P~2~, opening snap; these sounds often
        easier to appreciate than the characteristic low-pitched apical
        diastolic murmur

    -   Electrocardiography shows left atrial abnormality, and commonly,
        atrial ﬁbrillation; echo conﬁrms diagnosis, quantiﬁes severity

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Left ventricular failure due to any cause

    -   Mitral valve prolapse (if systolic murmur present)

    -   Pulmonary hypertension due to other cause

    -   Left atrial myxoma

    -   Cor triatriatum (in patients under 30)

    -   Tricuspid stenosis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Heart failure symptoms may be treated with diuretics and sodium
        restriction

    -   With atrial ﬁbrillation, ventricular rate controlled with
        beta-block- ers, calcium channel blockers such as verapamil or
        digoxin; long- term anticoagulation instituted with warfarin

    -   Balloon valvuloplasty or surgical valve replacement in patients
        with mitral oriﬁce of \< 1.5 cm^2^ and symptoms or evidence of
        pul- monary hypertension; valvuloplasty preferred in noncalciﬁed
        and pliable valves

####  1 Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Classically seen in patients with severe COPD; electrolyte
        > abnor- malities (especially hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia)
        > occasion- ally responsible

    -   Symptoms include those of the underlying disorder, but some may
        > complain of palpitations

    -   Irregularly irregular heart rate

    -   Electrocardiography shows at least three different P-wave mor-
        > phologies with varying PR intervals

    -   Ventricular rate usually between 100 and 140 beats/min; if \<
        > 100, rhythm is wandering atrial pacemaker

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Normal sinus rhythm with multiple premature atrial contractions

    -   Atrial ﬁbrillation

    -   Atrial ﬂutter with variable block

    -   Reentry tachycardia with variable block

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Treatment of the underlying disorder is most important

    -   Verapamil particularly useful for rate control; digitalis
        > ineffective

    -   Intravenous magnesium and potassium administered slowly may
        > convert some patients to sinus rhythm even if serum levels are
        > within normal range; be sure renal function is normal

    -   Medications causing atrial irritability, such as theophylline,
        > should be avoided

        > rare cases that are highly symptomatic and refractory to

####  Myocarditis 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Focal or diffuse inﬂammation of the myocardium due to various
        infections, toxins, drugs, or immunologic reactions; viral
        infection, particularly with coxsackieviruses, is the most
        common cause

    -   Other infectious causes include Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Q
        fever, Chagas' disease, Lyme disease, HIV, trichinosis, and
        toxoplasmosis

    -   Symptoms include fever, fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, or
        symp- toms of congestive heart failure, often following an upper
        respi- ratory tract infection

    -   Electrocardiography may reveal ST-T wave changes, conduction
        blocks

    -   Echocardiography shows diffusely depressed left ventricular
        func- tion and enlargement

    -   Routine myocardial biopsy usually not recommended since
        inﬂammatory changes are often focal and nonspeciﬁc

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Acute myocardial ischemia or infarction due to coronary artery
        disease

    -   Pneumonia

    -   Congestive heart failure due to other causes

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Bed rest

    -   Speciﬁc antimicrobial treatment if an infectious agent can be
        identiﬁed

    -   Immunosuppressive therapy is controversial

    -   Appropriate treatment of systolic dysfunction: vasodilators (ACE
        inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or combination of
        hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate), beta-blockers,
        spironolac- tone, digoxin, low-sodium diet, and diuretics

    -   Inotropes and cardiac transplant for severe cases

####  1 Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   A group of arrhythmias including atrioventricular nodal reen-
        > trant, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardias, automatic
        > atrial tachycardia, and junctional tachycardia

    -   Attacks usually begin and end abruptly, last seconds to hours

    -   Patients often asymptomatic with transient episodes but may com-
        > plain of palpitations, mild dyspnea, or chest pain

    -   Electrocardiography between attacks normal unless the patient
        > has Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or a very short PR interval

    -   Unless aberrant conduction occurs, the QRS complexes are regular
        > and narrow; P wave location helps determine the origin;
        > electro- physiologic study establishes the exact diagnosis

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

> *No P:*

-   Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia

> *Short RP:*

-   Typical atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia

-   Orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia

-   Atrial tachycardia with 1st degree AV delay

-   Junctional tachycardia

> *Long RP:*

-   Atrial tachycardia

-   Sinus tachycardia

-   Atypical atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia

-   Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Many attacks resolve spontaneously; if not, ﬁrst try vagal
        > maneu- vers such as carotid sinus massage or adenosine to
        > transiently block the AV node and break the reentrant circuit

    -   Prevention of frequent attacks can be achieved by calcium chan-
        > nel blockers, beta-blockers, or antiarrhythmics if necessary

    -   Electrophysiologic study and ablation of the abnormal reentrant
        > circuit or focus, when available, is the treatment of choice

####  Patent Ductus Arteriosus 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Caused by failure of closure of embryonic ductus arteriosus with
        con- tinuous blood ﬂow from aorta to pulmonary artery (ie,
        left-to-right shunt)

    -   Symptoms are those of left ventricular failure or pulmonary
        hyper- tension; many cases are complaint-free

    -   Widened pulse pressure, a loud S~2~, and a continuous,
        "machinery" murmur loudest over the pulmonary area but heard
        posteriorly

    -   Echo Doppler helpful, but contrast or MR aortography is the
        study of choice

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

> *In patients presenting with left heart failure:*

-   Mitral regurgitation

-   Aortic stenosis

-   Ventricular septal defect

> *If pulmonary hypertension dominates the picture:*

-   Primary pulmonary hypertension

-   Chronic pulmonary embolism

-   Eisenmenger's syndrome

```{=html}

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Pharmacologic closure in premature infants, using indomethacin
        or aspirin

    -   Surgical or percutaneous closure in patients with large shunts,
        symptoms, or previous endocarditis; controversial in other

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Caused by intermittent focal spasm of an otherwise normal coro-
        > nary artery

    -   Associated with migraine, Raynaud's phenomenon

    -   The chest pain resembles typical angina, but often is more
        > severe and occurs at rest

    -   Affects women under 50, occurs in the early morning, and typi-
        > cally involves the right coronary artery

        > studies are normal

    -   Diagnosis can be conﬁrmed by ergonovine challenge during cardiac
        > catheterization

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Typical angina pectoris; myocardial infarction; unstable angina

    -   Tietze's syndrome (costochondritis)

    -   Cervical or thoracic radiculopathy, including pre-eruptive
        > zoster

####  Pulmonary Stenosis 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Exertional dyspnea and chest pain due to right ventricular
        ischemia; sudden death occurs in severe cases

    -   Jugular venous distention, parasternal lift, systolic click and
        ejec- tion murmur, delayed and soft pulmonary component of S~2~

    -   Right ventricular hypertrophy on ECG; poststenotic dilation of
        the main and left pulmonary arteries on chest x-ray

    -   Echo Doppler is diagnostic

    -   May be associated with Noonan's syndrome

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Left ventricular failure due to any cause

    -   Left-sided valvular disease

    -   Primary pulmonary hypertension

    -   Chronic pulmonary embolism

    -   Sleep apnea

    -   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

    -   Eisenmenger's syndrome

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Symptomatic patients with peak gradient \> 30 mm Hg:
        Percutaneous balloon or surgical valvuloplasty

    -   Asymptomatic patients with peak gradient \> 40 mm Hg:

####  1 Restrictive Cardiomyopathy 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Characterized by impaired diastolic ﬁlling with preserved left
        > ventricular function

    -   Causes include amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, scle-
        > roderma, carcinoid syndrome, endomyocardial ﬁbrosis, and
        > postradiation or postsurgical ﬁbrosis

    -   Clinical manifestations are those of the underlying disorder;
        > con- gestive heart failure with right-sided symptoms and signs
        > usually predominates

    -   Electrocardiography may show low voltage and nonspeciﬁc ST-T
        > wave abnormalities in amyloidosis; supraventricular and
        > ventric- ular arrhythmias may also be seen

    -   Echo Doppler shows increased wall thickness with preserved con-
        > tractile function and mitral and tricuspid inﬂow velocity
        > patterns consistent with impaired diastolic ﬁlling

    -   Cardiac catheterization shows ventricular concordance with res-
        > piration as compared with constrictive pericarditis

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Constrictive pericarditis

    -   Hypertensive heart disease

    -   Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy

    -   Aortic stenosis

    -   Ischemic heart disease

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Sodium restriction and diuretic therapy for patients with

####  Sudden Cardiac Death 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Death in a well patient within 1 hour of symptom onset

    -   Can be due to cardiac or noncardiac disease

    -   Most common cause (\> 80% of cases) is ventricular ﬁbrillation
        or tachycardia in the setting of coronary artery disease

    -   Ventricular ﬁbrillation is almost always the terminal rhythm

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

> *Noncardiac causes of sudden death:*

-   Pulmonary embolism

-   Asthma

-   Aortic dissection

-   Ruptured aortic aneurysm

-   Intracranial hemorrhage

-   Tension pneumothorax

-   Anaphylaxis

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ##### Treatment

    -   Aggressive approach obligatory if coronary artery disease is
        sus- pected; see below

    -   Electrolyte abnormalities, digitalis toxicity, or implantable
        cardiac deﬁbrillator malfunction can be the precipitant and is
        treated accordingly

    -   Without obvious cause, echocardiography and cardiac catheteri-
        zation are indicated; if normal, electrophysiologic studies
        thereafter

    -   An automatic implantable cardiac deﬁbrillator should be used in
        all patients surviving an episode of sudden cardiac death
        second- ary to ventricular ﬁbrillation or tachycardia without a
        transient or reversible cause

-   ##### Pearl

####  Tricuspid Stenosis 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Usually rheumatic in origin; rarely, seen in carcinoid heart
        disease

    -   Almost always associated with mitral stenosis when rheumatic

    -   Evidence of right-sided failure: Hepatomegaly, ascites,
        peripheral edema, jugular venous distention with prominent (*a*)
        wave

    -   A diastolic rumbling murmur along the left sternal border,
        increas- ing with inspiration

    -   Echo Doppler is diagnostic

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Atypical aortic regurgitation

    -   Mitral stenosis

    -   Pulmonary hypertension due to any cause with right heart failure

    -   Constrictive pericarditis

    -   Liver cirrhosis

    -   Right atrial myxoma

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Valve replacement in severe cases

    -   Balloon valvuloplasty may prove to be useful in many patients

####  1 Unstable Angina 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Spectrum of illness between chronic stable angina and acute
        > myocardial infarction

    -   Characterized by accelerating angina, pain at rest, or pain less
        > responsive to medications

    -   Usually due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, spasm, hemor-
        > rhage, or thrombosis

    -   Chest pain resembles typical angina but is more severe and lasts
        > longer (up to 30 minutes)

    -   ECG may show dynamic ST-segment depression or T-wave changes
        > during pain, but normalizes when symptoms abate; a normal ECG,
        > however, does not exclude the diagnosis

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Typical angina pectoris; myocardial infarction

    -   Coronary vasospasm; aortic dissection

    -   Tietze's syndrome (costochondritis)

    -   Cervical or thoracic radiculopathy, including pre-eruptive
        > zoster

    -   Esophageal spasm or reﬂux disease

    -   Cholecystitis; pneumonia; pericarditis

    -   Pneumothorax

    -   Pulmonary embolism

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Hospitalization with bed rest, telemetry, and treatment similar
        > to acute coronary syndrome

    -   Low-dose aspirin (81--325 mg) immediately on admission for all;
        > intravenous heparin of beneﬁt

    -   Beta-blockers to keep heart rate and blood pressure in the low-
        > normal range

    -   In high-risk patients, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors
        > effective, especially if percutaneous intervention likely

    -   Nitroglycerin, either in paste or intravenously

####  Ventricular Septal Defect 1 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Many congenital ventricular septal defects close spontaneously
        during childhood

    -   Symptoms depend on the size of the defect and the magnitude of
        the left-to-right shunt

    -   Small defects in adults are usually asymptomatic except for com-
        plicating endocarditis, but may be associated with a loud murmur
        (maladie de Roger)

    -   Large defects usually associated with softer murmurs, but com-
        monly lead to Eisenmenger's syndrome

    -   Echo Doppler diagnostic; radionuclide angiogram or cardiac
        catheterization quantiﬁes the ratio of pulmonary ﬂow to systemic
        ﬂow (Q~P~:Q~S~)

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Mitral regurgitation

    -   Aortic stenosis

    -   Cardiomyopathy due to various causes

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Small shunts in asymptomatic patients may not require surgery

    -   Mild dyspnea treatable with diuretics and preload reduction

    -   Q~P~:Q~S~ shunts over 1.5 are repaired to prevent irreversible
        pul- monary vascular disease, but decision to close needs to be
        tailored to individual patient

    -   Surgery if patient has developed shunt reversal (Eisenmenger's
        syndrome) without ﬁxed pulmonary hypertension

####  1 Ventricular Tachycardia 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Three or more consecutive premature ventricular beats; nonsus-
        > tained (lasting \< 30 seconds) or sustained

    -   Mechanisms are reentry or automatic focus; may occur sponta-
        > neously or with myocardial infarction

    -   Other causes include acute or chronic ischemia, cardiomyopa-
        > thy, and drugs (eg, antiarrhythmics)

    -   Most patients symptomatic; syncope, palpitations, shortness of
        > breath, and chest pain are common

    -   S~1~ of variable intensity; S~3~ present

    -   Electrocardiography shows a regular, wide-complex tachycardia
        > (usually between 140 and 220 beats/min); between attacks, the
        > ECG often reveals evidence of prior myocardial infarction

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Any cause of supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduc-
        > tion (but a history of myocardial infarction or low ejection
        > frac- tion indicates ventricular tachycardia until proved
        > otherwise)

    -   Atrial ﬂutter with aberrant conduction

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Depends on whether the patient is stable or unstable

    -   If stable: intravenous lidocaine, procainamide, or amiodarone
        > can be used initially

    -   If unstable (hypotension, congestive heart failure, or angina):
        > immediate synchronized cardioversion

    -   Implantable cardiac deﬁbrillator placement should be strongly
        > considered

    -   In a patient with ischemic or nonischemic heart disease and a
        > low left ventricular ejection fraction (\< 35%), an
        > implantable cardiac deﬁbrillator is warranted, even in the
        > absence of documented ven- tricular tachycardia

    -   Ablation for those with repetitive shocks from deﬁbrillator

## Pulmonary Diseases

####  Acute Bacterial Pneumonia 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Fever, chills, dyspnea, cough with purulent sputum production;
        early pleuritic pain suggests pneumococcal etiology

    -   Tachycardia, tachypnea; bronchial breath sounds with percussive
        dullness and egophony over involved lungs

    -   Leukocytosis; WBC \< 5000 or \> 25,000 worrisome

    -   Patchy or lobar inﬁltrate by chest x-ray

    -   Diagnosis is clinical, but pathogen can be determined from
        proper sputum Gram stain and/or culture of sputum, blood
        (positive in

> \~10%, or pleural ﬂuid; pathogen only determined in 30--60%

-   Principal causes include *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus
    inﬂuenzae*, *Legionella* (elderly, smokers), gram-negative rods
    (alco- holics and aspirators), *Staphylococcus (postviral)*

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Atypical or viral pneumonia

    -   Pulmonary embolism with infarct

    -   Congestive heart failure; acute respiratory distress syndrome
        (ARDS)

    -   Interstitial lung disease

    -   Bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Empiric antibiotics for common organisms after obtaining
        cultures; initial dose given in the emergency department

    -   Hospitalize selected patients: ≥ 2 of the following CURB-65 cri-
        teria: **c**onfusion, blood **u**rea nitrogen \> 20 mg/dL,
        **r**espiratory rate

####  Acute Pulmonary Venous Thromboembolism 

#####  2 ■ Essentials of Diagnosis

-   Seen in immobilized patients, congestive heart failure, malig-
    > nancies, hypercoagulable states, and after pelvic trauma or
    > surgery

-   Abrupt onset of dyspnea and anxiety, with or without pleuritic chest
    > pain, cough with hemoptysis; syncope rare

-   Tachycardia, tachypnea most common; loud P~2~ with right-sided S~3~
    > characteristic but unusual

-   Acute respiratory alkalosis and hypoxemia

-   Elevations in brain natriuretic peptide (eg, BNP \> 100 pg/mL)
    > and/or troponins portend a worse prognosis and should prompt an
    > echocardiographic evaluation of right ventricular function

-   Quantitative D-dimer has excellent negative predictive value in
    > patients with low clinical pretest probability

-   CT angiogram is the new gold standard and essentially rules out
    > clinically signiﬁcant pulmonary embolism

-   A ventilation-perfusion scan can be done in patients who cannot
    > tolerate contrast dye; results rely on pretest probability

-   Lower-extremity ultrasound demonstrates deep venous thrombo- sis
    > (DVT) in half of patients

-   Rarely, pulmonary angiography required

```{=html}

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Pneumonia; myocardial infarction

    -   Any cause of acute respiratory distress

    -   Systemic inﬂammatory response syndrome (SIRS)

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Anticoagulation: Acutely with heparin, start warfarin
        > concurrently and continue for a minimum of 6 months (for
        > reversible cause) to lifelong (unprovoked or irreversible
        > cause)

    -   Thrombolytic therapy in selected patients with hemodynamic

####  Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis 2 

    -   Rapid onset of dyspnea and respiratory distress, commonly in
        setting of trauma, shock, aspiration, or sepsis

    -   Tachypnea, fever; crackles heard by auscultation

    -   Arterial hypoxemia refractory to supplemental oxygen, frequently
        requiring positive pressure ventilation; hypercapnia and
        respiratory acidosis due to increase in dead space fraction and
        decrease in tidal volume (lungs become stiff and difﬁcult to
        expand)

    -   Diffuse alveolar and interstitial inﬁltrates by radiography,
        often sparing costophrenic angles

    -   No clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension; pulmonary cap-
        illary wedge pressure \< 18 mm Hg

    -   Acute lung injury deﬁned by a Pao~2~:Fio~2~ ratio \< 300; ARDS
        is deﬁned by Pao~2~:Fio~2~ ratio \< 200

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Cardiogenic pulmonary edema

    -   Primary pneumonia due to any cause

    -   Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage

    -   Acute interstitial pneumonia (ie, Hamman-Rich syndrome)

    -   Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Mechanical ventilation with supplemental oxygen; positive end-
        expiratory pressure often required

    -   Low-tidal-volume ventilation, using 6 mL/kg predicted body
        weight, may reduce mortality

    -   A conservative ﬂuid strategy targeting an even total body ﬂuid
        bal- ance (requires daily diuretics) decreases both time on the
        venti- lator and time in the ICU

    -   Supportive therapy including adequate nutrition, vigilance for
        other organ dysfunction, and prevention of nosocomial compli-
        cations (eg, catheter-related infection, UTI,
        ventilator-associated pneumonia, venous thromboembolism, stress
        gastritis)

    -   Mortality rate is 30--60%

####  Acute Tracheobronchitis 

#####  2 ■ Essentials of Diagnosis

-   Poorly deﬁned but common condition characterized by inﬂam- mation of
    > the trachea and bronchi

-   Due to infectious agents (bacteria or viruses) or irritants (eg,
    > dust and smoke)

-   Consider nasal swab for inﬂuenza if constitutional symptoms present

-   Cough is most common symptom; purulent sputum production and malaise
    > common; hemoptysis occasionally

-   Variable rhonchi and wheezing; fever often absent but may be
    > prominent in cases caused by *Haemophilus inﬂuenzae*

-   Chest x-ray normal

-   Increased incidence in smokers

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Symptomatic therapy with inhaled bronchodilators, cough sup-

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Caused by allergy to antigens of *Aspergillus* species or other
        fungi colonizing the tracheobronchial tree

    -   Recurrent dyspnea, unmasked by corticosteroid withdrawal, with
        > history of asthma; cough productive of brownish plugs of
        > sputum

    -   Physical examination as in asthma

    -   Peripheral eosinophilia, elevated serum IgE level, precipitating
        > antibody to *Aspergillus* antigen present; positive skin
        > hypersen- sitivity to *Aspergillus* antigen

    -   Inﬁltrate (often ﬂeeting) and central bronchiectasis by chest
        > radi- ography

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Asthma

    -   Bronchiectasis

    -   Invasive aspergillosis

    -   Churg-Strauss syndrome

    -   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Oral corticosteroids often required for several months

    -   Inhaled bronchodilators as for attacks of asthma

    -   Treatment with itraconazole (for 16 weeks) improves disease
        control

    -   Complications include hemoptysis, severe bronchiectasis, and

####  Asbestosis 

#####  2 ■ Essentials of Diagnosis

-   History of exposure to dust containing asbestos particles (eg, from
    > work in mining, insulation, construction, shipbuilding)

-   Progressive dyspnea that appears 20--40 years after exposure, rarely
    > pleuritic chest pain

-   Dry inspiratory crackles and clubbing are common; cyanosis and signs
    > of cor pulmonale occasionally seen

-   Interstitial ﬁbrosis is characteristic (lower lung greater than
    > upper); pleural thickening and diaphragmatic calciﬁcation common
    > but nonspeciﬁc; however, the three together with exposure history
    > establish the diagnosis

-   Exudative pleural effusion develops before parenchymal disease

-   High-resolution CT scan often conﬁrmatory

-   Pulmonary function testing shows a restrictive defect; diminished
    > diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) often the
    > earliest abnormality

####  Asthma 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis 2 

    -   Episodic wheezing, cough, and dyspnea; poorly controlled chronic
        dyspnea or chest tightness; can present as nighttime cough

    -   Triggers include: allergens (pets), irritants (smoke),
        infections (viral), drugs (aspirin), cold air, exercise, stress

    -   Prolonged expiratory time, wheezing; if severe, pulsus paradoxus

    -   Peripheral eosinophilia; mucus casts, eosinophils in sputum

    -   Obstructive pattern by spirometry supports diagnosis, though may
        be normal between attacks

    -   With methacholine challenge, absence of bronchial hyperreac-
        tivity makes diagnosis unlikely

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Congestive heart failure; vocal cord dysfunction

    -   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

    -   Foreign body aspiration

    -   Allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis

    -   Churg-Strauss syndrome

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Avoidance of known precipitants, inhaled corticosteroids in per-
        sistent asthma, inhaled bronchodilators for symptoms

    -   Goal of treatment is to "step up" drug treatment until patient
        has achieved complete control of symptoms then "step down" as
        tolerated

    -   In patients not well controlled on inhaled corticosteroids, add
        a long-acting inhaled β-agonist (eg, salmeterol); do not use
        long- acting β-agonists in patients not using inhaled
        glucocorticoids

    -   Treatment of exacerbations: Oxygen, inhaled bronchodilators
        (β~2~- agonists \> anticholinergics), systemic corticosteroids
        (5 days)

    -   Leukotriene modiﬁers (eg, montelukast) may provide a second
        option for long-term therapy in mild to moderate disease

    -   Nedocromil/cromolyn is effective for exercise-induced asthma

    -   For difﬁcult-to-control asthma, consider exacerbating factors
        such as gastroesophageal reﬂux disease and chronic sinusitis

-   Pathogens include *Legionella*, *Mycoplasma*, *Chlamydia*, viruses

-   Cough with scant sputum, fever, malaise, headache; gastroin-
    > testinal symptoms variable

-   Physical examination of lungs may be unimpressive

-   Mild leukocytosis; cold agglutinins sometimes positive but not
    > diagnostic for *Mycoplasma*

-   Patchy, nonlobar inﬁltrate by chest x-ray often surprisingly
    > extensive

-   Typical and atypical pneumonia are not reliably distinguishable
    > clinically or radiographically

####  Bronchiectasis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis 2 

    -   A congenital or acquired disorder, affecting the large bronchi
        causing permanent abnormal dilation and destruction of bronchial
        walls; may be a consequence of untreated pneumonia

    -   Chronic cough with copious purulent sputum, hemoptysis; weight
        loss, recurrent pneumonias

    -   Coarse, midinspiratory moist crackles; clubbing

    -   Hypoxemia; obstructive pattern by spirometry

    -   Chest x-rays variable, may show tram-tracking (best seen on lat-
        eral ﬁlms) and multiple cystic lesions at bases in advanced
        cases

####  Chronic Cough 

#####  2 ■ Essentials of Diagnosis

-   One of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention

-   Deﬁned as a cough persisting for at least 4 weeks

    -   Fever, dry cough, wheezing, dyspnea, and weight loss---all vari-
        > able from transient to severe and progressive

    -   Wheezing, dry crackles occasionally appreciated by auscultation

    -   Peripheral blood eosinophilia (\> 1000 μL) present in most, but
        > not all

    -   Peripheral pulmonary inﬁltrates on radiographs in many cases

####  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) 

#####  2 ■ Essentials of Diagnosis

-   Primarily consisting of emphysema and chronic bronchitis

-   Dyspnea or chronic productive cough or both are characteristic; COPD
    > is nearly always a disease of heavy smokers (80--90%)

-   Tachypnea, barrel chest, distant breath sounds, wheezes or rhonchi,
    > cyanosis; clubbing unusual

-   Hypoxemia and hypercapnia more pronounced with chronic bron- chitis
    > than with emphysema, whereas pulmonary hypertension is more common
    > in patients with emphysema

-   Hyperexpansion with decreased markings by chest radiography

-   Airﬂow obstruction by spirometry (FEV~1~/FVC ratio \< 0.70); reduced
    diffusing capacity (DLCO) in emphysema

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Asthma

    -   Bronchiectasis

    -   β~1~-Antitrypsin deﬁciency

    -   Bronchiolitis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Stopping smoking is most important intervention

    -   Inhaled anticholinergic agents improve symptoms and decrease
        > exacerbations (inhaled tiotropium may be superior to
        > ipratropium)

    -   Long-acting β-agonists decrease exacerbations

    -   Chronic inhaled glucocorticoids may increase pneumonia risk; use
        > only if patient has clear symptomatic improvement

    -   Pneumococcal vaccination; yearly inﬂuenza vaccination

    -   Supplemental oxygen for hypoxemic patients (Pao~2~ \< 55 mm Hg
        > or O~2~ saturation \< 88%) reduces mortality

    -   For exacerbations, treat with bronchodilators, antibiotics, sys-
        > temic glucocorticoids with taper over 2 weeks

    -   Inpatients with ventilatory failure have a mortality beneﬁt from

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) and idiopathic BOOP are
        synonymous

    -   COP may follow infections (eg, *Mycoplasma*, viral infection),
        may be due to toxic fume inhalation or associated with connec-
        tive tissue disease or organ transplantation

    -   Affects patients of all ages (mean is 50 years), no sex
        predilec- tion, smoking not a precipitant

    -   Presentation often similar to community-acquired pneumonia; up
        to half have abrupt onset of ﬂulike symptoms such as fever,
        malaise, nonproductive cough, fatigue, and dyspnea

    -   Weight loss (often \> 10 lb) commonly observed

    -   Dry crackles by auscultation; wheezing and clubbing are both
        unusual

    -   Restrictive abnormalities with pulmonary function studies;
        hypox- emia typical

    -   Chest radiograph shows patchy alveolar inﬁltrates bilaterally

    -   Open or thoracoscopic lung biopsy necessary for precise
        diagnosis

    -   Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia

    -   Pulmonary toxicity due to drugs or autoimmune disorder

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Corticosteroids effective in two-thirds of cases; cytotoxic
        agents (eg, cyclophosphamide) in steroid failures

    -   Relapse common after short (\< 6 months) steroid courses

####  Cystic Fibrosis 

#####  2 ■ Essentials of Diagnosis

-   A generalized autosomal-recessive disorder of the exocrine glands
    > more common than was once believed

-   Cough, dyspnea, recurrent pulmonary infections often due to

> *Pseudomonas*; symptoms of malabsorption, infertility

-   Distant breath sounds, rhonchi, clubbing, nasal polyps

-   Hypoxemia; obstructive or mixed pattern by spirometry; decreased
    > diffusion capacity

-   Chest radiograph reveals bronchiectasis, upper lobe volume loss, and
    > cystic disease

-   Sweat chloride \> 60 mEq/L is characteristic, but false-negative
    > results can occur

    -   Atypical mycobacterial disease with bronchiectasis

    -   Pancreatic insufﬁciency; other causes of malabsorption

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Comprehensive multidisciplinary therapy required, including
        > genetic and occupational counseling

    -   Inhaled bronchodilators and chest physiotherapy

    -   Antibiotics for recurrent airway infections targeted at
        > resistant

> *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Staphylococcus aureus* species

-   Pneumococcal vaccination; yearly inﬂuenza vaccinations

-   Inhaled recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (a mucolytic agent) and

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Work and environmental history suggesting link between activi-
        > ties and symptoms

    -   Caused by exposure to microbial agents (eg, thermophilic
        > *Actinomyces* in farmer's lung, bagassosis, sequoiosis),
        > animal proteins (eg, bird fancier's lung), with resultant IgG
        > complement deposition, and chemical sensitizers (eg,
        > isocyanates, trimellitic anhydride)

    -   Acute form: 4--12 hours after exposure, cough, dyspnea, fever,
        > chills, myalgias; tachypnea, tachycardia, inspiratory
        > crackles; leuko- cytosis with lymphopenia and neutrophilia;
        > eosinophilia unusual

    -   Subacute or chronic form: Exertional dyspnea, cough, fatigue,
        > anorexia, weight loss; basilar crackles

    -   Presence of IgG precipitating antibodies against above antigens
        > indicates exposure but does not make diagnosis

    -   Skin testing not useful

    -   Pulmonary function tests reveal either airﬂow limitation or a
        > restrictive pattern and decreased DLCO

    -   High-resolution thoracic CT scan reveals upper lobe predomi-
        > nant ﬁne diffuse ground-glass abnormality with centrilobular
        > nod- ules; expiratory images reveal mosaicism

    -   Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals marked lymphocytosis

    -   Transbronchial or thoracoscopic lung biopsy can conﬁrm diag-
        > nosis in unclear cases

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis

    -   Sarcoidosis

    -   Asthma

    -   Atypical pneumonia

    -   Bronchiolitis of alternative etiology

####  Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis 2 

    -   A rare disorder seen primarily in young and middle-aged women

    -   Deﬁned as pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pres-
        sure \> 25 mm Hg) absent lung or left heart disease

    -   Progressive dyspnea, malaise, chest pain, exertional syncope

    -   Tachycardia, right ventricular lift, increased P~2~, pulmonary
        and/or tricuspid regurgitation murmurs, right-sided S~3~;
        evidence of right- sided heart failure (jugular venous
        distention, peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, ascites) common

    -   Right axis deviation, right bundle-branch block, right
        ventricular strain or hypertrophy by electrocardiography

    -   Echocardiographic evidence of elevated right ventricular (RV)
        systolic pressure with or without evidence of RV dilation or
        dysfunction

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Pulmonary venous hypertension (mitral stenosis, left heart
        failure from any etiology)

    -   Sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndromes

    -   Chronic thromboembolic disease

    -   Parenchymal lung disease; autoimmune lung disease

        drug-induced pulmonary hypertension

    -   HIV-associated pulmonary hypertension

    -   Portopulmonary hypertension (cirrhosis and portal hypertension)

-   ##### Treatment

    -   A minority of patients (\~5%) respond well to calcium channel
        blockers over the long term; response seen only in patients who
        respond to vasodilator challenge during right heart
        catheterization

    -   Continuous intravenous prostacyclin analogues are the best stud-
        ied agents and are generally initiated in more severe cases

    -   Endothelin receptor blockers and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors
        improve symptoms in mild or moderately severe cases

    -   Empiric anticoagulation may confer survival beneﬁt

    -   Combinations of agents are generally more beneﬁcial than any
        agent alone: clinical beneﬁt versus side effects must be
        considered

    -   Lung or heart-lung transplantation should be considered

-   Restrictive pattern with decreased total lung capacity and diffus-
    > ing capacity (DLCO)

-   High-resolution thoracic CT scan may conﬁdently establish diag-
    > nosis in many

    -   Patients with periodontal disease, alcoholism, impaired degluti-
        tion (eg, neurologic or esophageal disorder or altered
        conscious- ness) predisposed

    -   Usual cause is mixed aerobic/anaerobic infection

    -   Bronchial breath sounds with dullness and egophony over involved
        lung; succussion splash and amphoric breathing indicate air-ﬂuid
        level

    -   Leukocytosis; hypoxemia

    -   Chest x-ray density, often with central lucency or air-ﬂuid
        level

####  Pandemic H1N1 Inﬂuenza A 

#####  2 ■ Essentials of Diagnosis

-   A novel H1N1 inﬂuenza A virus created by reassortment of two swine,
    > one human, and one avian strain; ﬁrst noted in summer of 2009

-   Unlike seasonal inﬂuenza, pandemic H1N1 strain disproportion- ately
    > causes severe infection in patients aged 20-40

-   Human-to-human transmissibility, primarily through sneezing and
    > coughing, appears higher compared with seasonal inﬂuenza

-   Most common symptoms are those of seasonal inﬂuenza (fever, cough,
    > sore throat, malaise, headache), though nausea, vomiting, and
    > diarrhea may also be present

-   Less than 1% of patients require hospitalization; common risk fac-
    > tors for complications are COPD, immunosuppression, heart dis-
    > ease, pregnancy, diabetes, obesity

-   Diagnostic testing recommended on hospitalized patients and those at
    > risk for complications

-   Rapid antigen testing has poor sensitivity; conﬁrmation of pan-
    > demic infection can only be made by polymerase chain reaction or
    > culture

        ﬂuid protein:serum protein ratio \> 0.5; pleural ﬂuid lactate
        dehydro- genase (LDH):serum LDH ratio \> 0.6; or pleural ﬂuid
        LDH \> two- thirds the upper limit of normal serum LDH

    -   An exudative effusion is considered complicated if any of the
        fol- lowing are present: pH \< 7.20, glucose \< 60 mg/dL, Gram
        stain or cul- ture positive, effusion \> 1/2 hemithorax on chest
        x-ray, loculations or pleural enhancement seen on CT scan,
        pleural ﬂuid LDH \> 3 times upper limit of normal serum LDH

    -   Markedly reduced glucose in empyema, rheumatoid effusion

####  Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis 

#####  2 ■ Essentials of Diagnosis

-   Most cases are acquired; idiopathic or associated with several
    > diseases (eg, postinfection, immunocompromised host, hemato- logic
    > malignancy); congenital also possible (rare)

-   Acquired cases are due to production of autoantibodies that pre-
    > vent granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM- CSF)
    > from binding to its receptor, resulting in decreased surfactant
    > catabolism in alveolar macrophages

-   Congenital cases due to mutations in surfactant B and C

-   Typical age 30 and 50; men outnumber women 3:1

-   Progressive dyspnea on exertion, low-grade fever, weight loss,
    > fatigue, nonproductive cough; asymptomatic patients common

-   Physical examination often normal; rales present in 50%

-   Hypoxemia; bilateral alveolar inﬁltrates suggestive of pulmonary
    > edema on chest radiography; "crazy paving" seen on chest CT scan

-   Serum lactate dehydrogenase is typically elevated and can be used to
    > follow disease activity

-   Measurement of anti--GM-CSF antibodies in serum or bronchial
    > alveolar lavage has excellent sensitivity for diagnosis

-   The gold standard for diagnosis is characteristic intra-alveolar
    > accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material without parenchymal
    > ﬁbrosis seen on surgical lung biopsy, though most diagnoses can be
    > made with a compatible history, CT scan, and bronchoscopy

-   Superinfection with *Nocardia* and mycobacteria is common

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Congestive heart failure

    -   Atypical infection (eg, *P. jiroveci* pneumonia)

    -   Interstitial lung disease

    -   Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Up to 25% remit spontaneously

    -   Periodic whole-lung lavage via double-lumen endotracheal tube
        > reduces exertional dyspnea in those with limiting symptoms

    -   Treat underlying cause in secondary forms

    -   In acquired disease, GM-CSF therapy appears to be beneﬁcial

####  Pulmonary Langerhans' Cell Histiocytosis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis 2 

    -   Uncommon interstitial lung disorder primarily affecting smokers
        > between 20 and 40

    -   The pathologic cell (Langerhans' cell) is a differentiated cell
        > within the monocyte-macrophage line

    -   Mid- to upper-zone lung involvement is common (as opposed to
        > characteristic lower-zone involvement of idiopathic pulmonary
        > ﬁbrosis)

    -   Patients may present asymptomatically on chest radiography or
        > after spontaneous pneumothorax

    -   Symptoms are nonspeciﬁc and may include dry cough, dyspnea,
        > fatigue, pleuritic chest pain, weight loss, fever

    -   Physical exam usually normal; however, clubbing and crackles
        > occasionally occur; labs usually normal; no eosinophilia

    -   Complications include recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, hemop-
        > tysis, bone pain (due to bone cysts), diabetes insipidus,
        > malignancy

    -   Reticulonodular inﬁltrates, stellate nodules, upper zone cysts,
        > absence of pleural effusion, normal lung volume on chest ﬁlm

    -   High-resolution CT especially helpful; pulmonary function tests
        > usually reveal decreased diffusion capacity; some have
        > restrictive or obstructive ﬁndings

    -   Deﬁnitive diagnosis requires tissue via bronchoscopy or video-
        > assisted thoracoscopic surgery; bronchoalveolar lavage may be
        > suggestive if 5% or more Langerhans' cells are found

    -   Some patients remit; others progress to chronic lung disease

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Cystic ﬁbrosis

    -   Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis

    -   Sarcoidosis

    -   Drug-induced or idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis

    -   Hypersensitivity pneumonitis

    -   Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Smoking cessation is most important intervention

####  Pulmonary Tuberculosis 

#####  2 ■ Essentials of Diagnosis

-   Lassitude, weight loss, fever, cough, night sweats, hemoptysis

-   Cachexia in many; posttussive apical rales occasionally present

-   Apical or subapical inﬁltrates with cavities classic in reactivation
    > tuberculosis; pleural effusion in primary tuberculosis, likewise
    > mid-lung inﬁltration, but any radiographic abnormality possible

-   Positive skin test to intradermal puriﬁed protein derivative (PPD)

-   Interferon-gamma release assays have good speciﬁcity for latent
    > tuberculosis

-   *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* by culture of sputum, gastric wash-
    > ing, or pleural biopsy; pleural ﬂuid culture usually sterile

-   Nucleic acid ampliﬁcation can rapidly distinguish between *M.
    > tuberculosis* and nontuberculous mycobacterium to guide treat-
    > ment decisions but culture still needed for susceptibility testing

-   Increasingly encountered antibiotic-resistant strains

-   Granuloma on pleural biopsy in patients with effusions; mesothe-
    > lial cells usually absent from ﬂuid

-   Miliary tuberculosis (widespread hematogenous spread of organism)
    > has diverse clinical presentations including failure to thrive,
    > fever of unknown origin, multiorgan system failure, ARDS; nearly
    > all have overt pulmonary involvement with numerous small nodules

    -   Lung carcinoma; fungal infection

    -   Bacterial pneumonia or lung abscess; other mycobacterial
        > infections

    -   Sarcoidosis; pneumoconiosis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Combination antituberculous therapy for 6--9 months; all regi-
        > mens include isoniazid, but rifampin, ethambutol,
        > pyrazinamide, and streptomycin all have activity

    -   Avoid empiric treatment for community-acquired pneumonia with
        > ﬂuoroquinolones if *M. tuberculosis* is suspected as transient
        > use may facilitate development of resistance

    -   All cases of suspected *M. tuberculosis* infection should be
        > reported to local health departments

####  Sarcoidosis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis 2 

    -   A disease of unknown cause with an increased incidence in North
        American blacks, Northern European whites, and Japanese

    -   Malaise, fever, dyspnea of insidious onset; symptoms referable
        to eyes, skin, nervous system, liver, joints, or heart
        encountered; often presents asymptomatically

    -   Iritis, erythema nodosum or granulomatous skin lesions, parotid
        enlargement, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly

    -   Hypercalcemia (5%) less common than hypercalciuria (20%)

    -   Pulmonary function testing may show evidence of obstruction, but
        restriction with decreased DLCO is more common

    -   Symmetric hilar and right paratracheal adenopathy, interstitial
        inﬁltrates, or both seen on chest x-ray

    -   Tissue reveals noncaseating granuloma; transbronchial biopsy
        sensitive, even without parenchymal disease on chest ﬁlm

    -   Increased angiotensin-converting enzyme levels are neither sen-
        sitive nor speciﬁc; cutaneous anergy in 70%

    -   ECG may show heart block of varying degrees

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Tuberculosis

    -   Lymphoma, including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis

    -   Histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis

    -   Idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis

    -   Pneumoconiosis

    -   Berylliosis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Systemic corticosteroid therapy for symptomatic pulmonary dis-
        ease, cardiac involvement, iritis unresponsive to local therapy,
        hypercalcemia, central nervous system involvement, arthritis,
        nodular skin lesions

    -   Asymptomatic patients with normal pulmonary function may not
        require corticosteroids---they should receive close clinical
        follow-up

####  Silicosis 

#####  2 ■ Essentials of Diagnosis

-   A chronic ﬁbrotic lung disease caused by inhalation of dusts con-
    > taining crystalline silicon dioxide in foundry work, sandblasting,
    > and hard rock mining

-   Progressive dyspnea, often over months to years

-   Dry inspiratory crackles by auscultation

-   Characteristic changes on chest radiograph with bilateral, pre-
    > dominantly upper lobe ﬁbrosis, nodules, and hilar lym-
    > phadenopathy with "eggshell" calciﬁcation

-   Pulmonary function studies yield mixed obstructive and restric- tive
    > pattern

-   Superimposed mycobacterial disease (tuberculosis and nontu-
    > berculous) common in patients with silicosis and should be ruled
    > out if there is any clinical or radiographic suspicion

-   Connective tissue diseases commonly (\~10%) complicate the clinical
    > course

    -   Tuberculosis (often complicates silicosis)

    -   Sarcoidosis

    -   Histoplasmosis

    -   Coccidioidomycosis

####  Sleep Apnea 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis 2 

    -   Excessive daytime somnolence or fatigue, morning headache,
        weight gain, erectile dysfunction; bed partner may report
        restless sleep, loud snoring, and witnessed apneic episodes

    -   Obesity, systemic hypertension common; signs of pulmonary
        hypertension or cor pulmonale may develop over time

    -   Erythrocytosis common

    -   Diagnosis conﬁrmed by formal polysomnography

    -   Most cases of central apnea also have an obstructive component;
        pure central sleep apnea is rare

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Alcohol or sedative abuse

    -   Narcolepsy

    -   Seizure disorder

    -   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

    -   Hypothyroidism

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Weight loss and avoidance of hypnotic medications mandatory

    -   Nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and supple-
        mental oxygen frequently abolish obstructive apnea

    -   Oral appliances improve symptoms and reduce apnea-hypopnea
        episodes, but are not as effective as CPAP; use in patients
        unable to tolerate CPAP

    -   Modaﬁnil may be beneﬁcial as adjunctive therapy for excessive
        daytime sleepiness that persists despite adequate conventional
        therapy

    -   Surgical approaches (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, nasal septo-
        plasty, tracheostomy) reserved for selected cases

####  Solitary Pulmonary Nodule 

#####  2 ■ Essentials of Diagnosis

-   A round or oval circumscribed lesion \< 3 cm in diameter amid normal
    > lung tissue

-   Twenty-ﬁve percent of cases of bronchogenic carcinoma present as
    > such; the 5-year survival rate so detected is 50%

-   Factors favoring benign lesion: Age \< 35 years, asymptomatic, size

> \< 2 cm, diffuse calciﬁcation, and smooth margins

-   Factors suggesting malignancy: Age \> 45, symptoms, smoking history,
    > size \> 2 cm, lack of calcification, indistinct margins
    > (spiculation)

-   Skin tests, serologies, cytology rarely helpful

-   Comparison with earlier radiographs essential, if available; follow-
    > up with serial plain ﬁlms or CT scans helpful in appropriate
    > patients

-   Positron emission tomography (PET) scans help distinguish malig-
    > nancy from benign causes in lesions \> 8 mm; sensitivity limited
    > by rare slow-growing malignant lesions (bronchioalveolar cell
    > carcinoma and carcinoid tumors), and speciﬁcity limited by inﬂam-

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Benign causes: Granuloma (eg, tuberculosis or fungal infection),
        > arteriovenous malformation, pseudotumor, lipoma, hamartoma

    -   Malignant causes: Primary or metastatic malignancy

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, bronchoscopic biopsy,
        > surgical resection, or radiographic follow-up over 2 years;
        > negative FNA or bronchoscopic biopsy does not exclude
        > malignancy due to a high per- centage of false negatives

    -   Thoracic CT scan (with thin cuts through nodule) to look for
        > benign-appearing calciﬁcations and evaluate mediastinum for
        > lymphadenopathy

    -   With high-risk clinical or radiographic features, surgical

####  Spontaneous Pneumothorax 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis 2 

    -   Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in the absence of clin-
        ical pulmonary disease; secondary pneumothorax complicates a
        preexisting disease (eg, asthma, COPD)

    -   Primary spontaneous pneumothorax generally occurs in tall, thin
        boys and young men who smoke

    -   Abrupt onset of ipsilateral chest/shoulder pain and dyspnea

    -   Decreased breath sounds over involved hemithorax, which may be
        bronchial but distant in 100% pneumothorax; hyperresonance,
        tachycardia, hypotension, and mediastinal shift toward
        contralat- eral side if tension is present

    -   Chest x-ray diagnostic with retraction of lung from parietal
        pleura

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Myocardial infarction; pulmonary emboli

    -   Pericarditis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Assessment for cause, eg, *P. jiroveci* pneumonia, lung cancer,
        COPD, cystic lung disease

    -   Immediate decompression by needle if tension suspected

    -   Spontaneous pneumothoraces of \< 15% (\< 3 cm from pleura to
        chest wall on upright chest x-ray) followed by serial
        radiographs and 6 hours of observation in the hospital for
        stability; if \> 15%, treat by aspirating pleural air through a
        small catheter; if unsuc- cessful, insert chest tube

    -   100% humidiﬁed oxygen therapy replaces nitrogen with oxygen in
        the pleural space and markedly decreases re-absorption time

    -   Secondary pneumothoraces (eg, due to COPD, cystic ﬁbrosis)
        usually require chest tube

    -   Recurrence high (up to 50%) in primary spontaneous pneumothorax;
        smoking cessation decreases rate of recurrence

    -   In patients whose jobs or hobbies (eg, pilots and deep sea
        divers) put them or others at risk of death, consider
        pleurodesis after the ﬁrst event

    -   Therapy for recurrent pneumothorax includes surgical pleurode-
        sis or stapling of the ruptured blebs

####  Acute Colonic Pseudo-Obstruction (Ogilvie's Syndrome)

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Often seen in elderly hospitalized patients

    -   Associated with a history of trauma, fractures, cardiac disease,
        3

> infection, or the use of opioids, antidepressants, and anticholin-
> ergics

-   Often detected as a distended, tympanitic abdomen with abdom- inal
    x-ray revealing gross colonic dilation (usually right sided, with
    cecum \> 10 cm), scant air-ﬂuid levels, a gradual transition to col-
    lapsed bowel, and air and stool present in the rectum

-   May mimic true obstruction, and obstruction should be evaluated with
    radiologic studies using diatrizoate (Hypaque) enema

-   Fevers, marked abdominal tenderness, leukocytosis, and acidosis may
    be present in advanced cases with impending perforation

        intra- venous ﬂuids

    -   Correction of electrolyte abnormalities (Ca^2+^, Mg^2+^, K^+^,
        PO4)

    -   Discontinue offending medications and treat underlying infec-
        tions

    -   Tap water enemas and patient repositioning may be of beneﬁt

    -   Neostigmine (2 mg intravenously), in patients failing conserva-
        tive therapy, can be very effective for decompression. Main side
        effect is bradycardia.

    -   Colonoscopic decompression for patients failing neostigmine or
        in whom neostigmine therapy is contraindicated

    -   Surgical consultation for patients with peritoneal signs or

####  Barrett's Esophagus 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Barrett's esophagus is asymptomatic, but many patients present

3 with symptoms of gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (GERD):

> Dysphagia, heartburn, regurgitation in supine position

-   Upper endoscopy with biopsy reveals columnar epithelium replac- ing
    > squamous epithelium

-   Risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma is 0.5% per year

```{=html}

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   GERD

    -   Achalasia

    -   Esophageal or mediastinal tumor

    -   Esophageal web

    -   Benign stricture

    -   Left atrial enlargement or pericardial effusion

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Acid suppression (pH \> 4) with proton pump inhibitors

    -   Surgical fundoplication in selected patients (for therapy of
        > chronic reﬂux symptoms)

    -   In patients with neoplastic Barrett's, consider endoscopic
        > mucosal resections (for nodular lesions) and mucosal ablation
        > (for ﬂat neo- plasia) using radiofrequency ablation,
        > photodynamic therapy, cryoablation, or argon plasma
        > coagulation. Patients with isolated low- or high-grade
        > dysplasia may be treated with endoscopic ther- apy alone.
        > However, all those with invasive cancers should be considered
        > for surgery.

####  Celiac Sprue 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Caused by an immune reaction to gluten in diet in genetically

3 susceptible individuals

-   The prevalence of celiac disease in the United States is approxi-
    > mately 1:100 (1%)

-   Main manifestations are of malabsorption: Bulky, pale, frothy,
    > greasy stools (steatorrhea); abdominal distention, ﬂatulence,
    > weight loss, and evidence of fat-soluble vitamin deﬁciencies; labs
    > may be notable for a hypochromic or megaloblastic anemia; abnormal
    > D-xylose absorption; increased fecal fat on quantitative studies

-   However, clinical manifestations are variable. Patients may present
    > with abdominal pain, constipation, iron deﬁciency anemia, weight
    > loss, or elevated liver enzymes of unknown etiology.
    > Nongastrointestinal manifestations include neuropsychiatric
    > disease, arthritis, metabolic bone disease, and infertility

-   IgA endomysial antibody and tissue transglutaminase antibody are
    > positive in disease; and if negative, can help exclude the
    > diagnosis.

####  Chronic Pancreatitis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   The three main clinical features are abdominal pain,
        maldigestion,

> and diabetes. 3

-   Pancreatic calciﬁcation by radiographic study

-   Causes: Alcoholism (most common), hereditary pancreatitis,
    autoimmune pancreatitis, tropical pancreatitis, untreated hyper-
    parathyroidism, cystic ﬁbrosis, secondary to ductal obstruction or
    after abdominal trauma

-   Diagnostic studies include endoscopic ultrasound, magnetic resonance
    cholangiopancreatography, and an abnormal secretin pancreatic
    stimulation test. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is
    usually reserved for cases requiring therapeutic intervention.
    Lipase and amylase are usually normal.

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Low-fat diet, pancreatic enzyme supplements, avoidance of
        alcohol

    -   Pain management includes opioids and amitriptyline

    -   Endoscopic sphincterotomy and pancreatic duct stenting, as well
        as endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac block for pain manage-
        ment, have yielded disappointing results

    -   Treatment of hyperlipidemia if present

    -   Intravenous ﬂuid and electrolyte replacement for acute exacer-
        bations

    -   Surgical therapy to restore free ﬂow of bile or to treat

    -   Lymphoma, other tumors of small intestine

-   ##### Treatment

    -   High protein, low-residue, and lactose-free diet during acute
        ﬂares

    -   Consider 5-ASA for mild colonic disease and budesonide for mild
        ileal and right colonic disease.

    -   Corticosteroids can be used during acute ﬂares, but if a patient
        requires steroids, then the treatment strategy should include a
        maintenance regimen (such as an immunomodulator, like
        6-merpcatopurine/ azathioprine or methotrexate). In the case of
        severe, refractory, or ﬁstulous disease, consider a biologic
        agent (anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibodies)

    -   Perianal abscess requires surgical drainage prior to treatment.
        For nonsuppurative ﬁstulizing and perianal disease, consider
        antibi- otics, immunomodulators, and inﬂiximab.

####  Intestinal Tuberculosis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Chronic abdominal pain, anorexia, bloating; weight loss, fever,

> diarrhea, new-onset ascites in many 3

-   Mild right lower quadrant tenderness, as ileocecal area is the most
    commonly involved intestinal site; ﬁstula-in-ano sometimes seen

-   Barium study may reveal mucosal ulcerations or scarring and ﬁbrosis
    with narrowing of the small or large intestine

-   In peritonitis, ascitic ﬂuid has high protein and mononuclear pleo-
    cytosis; peritoneal biopsy with granulomas is more sensitive than
    ascites AFB culture; high adenosine deaminase levels in ascitic ﬂuid
    may suggest the diagnosis; TB peritonitis more common in those with
    immune compromise

-   Complications include intestinal obstruction, hemorrhage, ﬁstula
    formation, and bacterial overgrowth with malabsorption

####  Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Chronic functional disorder characterized by abdominal pain or

3 discomfort associated with altered bowel habits, occurring for at

> least 3 months

-   Variable abdominal tenderness

-   More common in women and if a history of physical abuse

-   Evaluation: History and physical exam, colonoscopy in patients over
    > age 50; further testing as indicated for alarm symptoms or
    > physical exam ﬁndings

-   Studies (such as complete blood count, ova and parasite, thyroid-

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Hematemesis of bright red blood, often after prolonged or force-
        3

> ful vomiting or retching; majority lack this history

-   Because many patients are hypovolemic, portal pressure is low and
    bleeding unimpressive

-   More impressive in alcoholics with brisk bleeding because of
    associated coagulopathy and may involve esophageal varices

-   Endoscopic demonstration of vertical mucosal tear at cardioe-
    sophageal junction or proximal stomach

-   Hiatal hernia often associated

    -   Esophageal varices

    -   Gastritis

    -   Reﬂux, infectious, or pill esophagitis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Usually none required; spontaneous resolution of bleeding unless
        concomitant varices present

    -   Endoscopic hemostatic intervention with epinephrine injection,
        thermal coaptation, banding or endoscopic clipping for active
        bleeding; rarely, balloon tamponade, embolization, or surgery is
        required for uncontrolled bleeding

    -   Antibiotic-associated diarrhea

    -   Radiation colitis or collagenous colitis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   High-protein, low-residue, lactose-free diet during ﬂares

    -   Mild or moderate UC can be treated with oral 5-ASA or topical
        mesalamine (by enema or suppository) to induce and maintain a
        remission; can add corticosteroid enemas or suppositories for
        additional symptomatic relief

    -   Corticosteroids for acute ﬂare refractory to maximal dose
        oral/rectal 5-ASA; consider addition of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)
        or aza- thioprine in patients who cannot achieve steroid-free
        remission.

    -   Consider inﬂiximab in patients who are steroid refractory or
        steroid dependent despite therapy with 6-MP or azathioprine

    -   For a severe ﬂare requiring hospitalization, IV corticosteroids
        should be given; patients failing to respond within 3--5 days
        should be considered for colectomy versus a trial of
        cyclosporine or inﬂiximab.

    -   Colectomy for toxic megacolon unresponsive to medical therapy

####  Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (Gastrinoma) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Severe, recurrent, intractable peptic ulcer disease, often
        associated

> with concomitant esophagitis; ulcers may be in atypical locations, 3
>
> like jejunum, but most occur in usual sites

-   Eighty percent of cases are sporadic; the rest are associated with
    multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)

-   Fasting serum gastrin \> 150 pg/mL (often much higher) in the set-
    ting of a low gastric pH; elevated serum chromogranin A; renal
    insufﬁciency; proton pump inhibitors can also raise serum gastrin

-   Diarrhea common, caused by inactivation of pancreatic enzymes;
    relieved by nasogastric tube suctioning immediately

-   Gastrinomas may arise in pancreas, duodenum, or lymph nodes;

## Hepatobiliary Disorders

####  Acute Liver Failure 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Severe liver injury in a person with previously normal liver
        > func- tion, associated with development of hepatic
        > encephalopathy and evidence of hepatic synthetic dysfunction

        > nausea, vomiting, ﬂulike symptoms, or altered mental status

    -   Etiologies include acetaminophen overdose, idiosyncratic drug
        > reaction, acute viral hepatitis, exposure to hepatotoxins,
        > autoim- mune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, complications of
        > pregnancy, and vascular disorders

    -   Markedly abnormal liver function tests: Elevated bilirubin,
        > AST/ALT \> 1000, elevated international normalized ratio.

    -   Prognosis depends on etiology, rapidity of onset and degree of
        > encephalopathy, and development of complications

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Acute decompensation of chronic liver disease

    -   Acute viral hepatitis; alcoholic hepatitis; sepsis

    -   Idiopathic drug reaction

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Prompt recognition of acute liver failure key

        > failure, not just patients with acetaminophen overdose

    -   After resuscitation and stabilization, transfer to a transplant
        center

    -   Surveillance for infection; consider prophylactic antibiotics in
        > patients with advanced encephalopathy, systemic inﬂammatory
        > response syndrome, or awaiting liver transplantation

    -   Management of complications: hepatic encephalopathy, cerebral
        > edema, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress
        > syndrome, cardiovascular compromise, metabolic disturbances,
        > bleeding

        4

> (ALT \> AST); serologic tests for hepatitis A (HAV IgM), hepati- tis B
> (HBsAg, HB core ab IGM), or hepatitis C (HCV RNA) may be positive

-   Liver biopsy shows characteristic hepatocellular necrosis and
    mononuclear inﬁltrates

-   Hepatitis A: Fecal-oral transmission, short incubation period; good
    prognosis, but rare cases of fulminant hepatic failure

-   Hepatitis B and hepatitis C: Parenteral transmission, longer incu-
    bation period, progression to chronic disease more likely

-   Hepatitis E: Fecal-oral transmission, usually by contaminated water
    in endemic regions, although other transmission routes probable;
    during pregnancy, infection can lead to fulminant hep- atitis with
    mortality rates of 15--25%

####  Choledocholithiasis/Cholangitis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Often a history of biliary tract disease; episodic attacks of
        > right abdominal or epigastric pain that may radiate to the
        > right scapula or shoulder; occasionally painless jaundice

4 • Pain, fever, and jaundice (Charcot's triad), associated with nausea,

> vomiting, hypothermia, shock, and leukocytosis with a left shift

-   Elevated liver function tests, especially bilirubin and alkaline
    > phosphatase; during acute impaction, there may be a rapid rise of
    > serum AST/ALT due to hepatocellular injury

-   Abdominal imaging studies may reveal gallstones. Ultrasound or CT
    > scan shows dilated biliary tree and can sometimes identify stones
    > within the bile duct.

-   Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), endoscopic retrograde cholan-
    > giopancreatography (ERCP), or magnetic resonance cholan-
    > giopancreatography (MRCP) localizes the degree and location of
    > obstruction

        veins from a variety of causes; more common in women

    -   Acute or chronic onset of tender, painful hepatic enlargement,

> jaundice, splenomegaly, and ascites 4

-   Doppler ultrasound or venography demonstrates occlusion of the
    hepatic veins; CT and MRI can also be helpful

-   Liver scintigraphy may show a prominent caudate lobe because its
    venous drainage may not be occluded; liver biopsy reveals
    characteristic central lobular congestion

-   Underlying causes include hypercoagulable states (both inher- ited
    and acquired), caval webs, polycythemia, right-sided heart failure,
    malignancy, "bush teas" (pyrrolizidine alkaloids), parox- ysmal
    nocturnal hemoglobinuria, birth control pills, pregnancy, Behçet's

####  Sclerosing Cholangitis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Progressively obstructive jaundice, pruritus, malaise, and
        anorexia; most common in young men aged 20--40 years

    -   60--80% of cases have associated IBD, predominantly ulcerative

> colitis; some may be asymptomatic 4

-   Positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody found in 70%; ele-
    vated total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase common

-   Imaging by MRCP or ERCP; MRCP demonstrates multifocal stric- tures
    and segmental dilations ("beading") and is the diagnostic modal- ity
    of choice for suspected primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); ERCP
    is more invasive, results in hospitalizations due to complica- tions

        major impact on the prevention of complications (cholangitis,
        obstruction, cholangiocarcinoma and hepatic failure) or survival

    -   Ursodeoxycholic acid may improve liver function tests but does
        not alter symptoms or natural history

    -   Fat-soluble vitamin and calcium supplementation

    -   Stenting or balloon dilation of symptomatic obstruction due to
        dominant strictures by ERCP

    -   At diagnosis, all patients with PSC should be evaluated for IBD
        with colonoscopy and biopsy; these patients are at signiﬁcantly
        increased risk of IBD-associated colorectal cancer, and surveil-
        lance colonoscopy is recommended at 1--2-year intervals from
        time of diagnosis

####  Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Symptoms variable; often diagnosed by examination or blood count
        done for unrelated reasons

    -   Leukocytosis, typically striking; immature white cells in
        periph- eral blood and bone marrow; thrombocytosis,
        eosinophilia,

> basophilia common 5

    (bcr-abl fusion gene) by conventional cytogenetics, reverse
    transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of peripheral blood or bone
    marrow, or ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization

-   Low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase level, markedly elevated serum
    vitamin B~12~ due to high B~12~ binding transcobalamins

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Leukemoid reactions associated with infection, inﬂammation, or
        cancer

    -   Other myeloproliferative disorders

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib mesylate \[Gleevec\])
        targeting speciﬁc molecular defect in CML cells (bcr-abl fusion
        gene) is ﬁrst-line therapy; imatinib-resistant patients who are
        not trans- plantation candidates can be treated with other
        tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib, nilotinib)

    -   Combination of cytarabine and interferon leads to cytogeneti-
        cally complete remissions in a small minority of patients

    -   Due to its signiﬁcant toxicity, allogeneic bone marrow
        transplan- tation is often reserved for imatinib-resistant
        disease, but can be applied earlier for younger patients with
        matched sibling donors because it remains the only curative
        modality

####  Arthritis Associated with Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Peripheral arthritis: Asymmetric oligoarthritis that typically
        > involves the knees, ankles, and occasionally the upper
        > extremities; in some patients with ulcerative colitis,
        > severity of ﬁndings can parallel bowel disease activity

####  Carpal Tunnel Syndrome 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   The most common entrapment neuropathy, caused by compres- sion
        > of the median nerve (which innervates the ﬂexor muscles of the
        > wrist and ﬁngers)

    -   Middle-aged women and those with a history of repetitive use of

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Subacute, recurrent, and under-appreciated cause of chronic
        arthri- tis, usually involving large joints (especially knees,
        shoulders, and wrists) and almost always accompanied by
        chondrocalcinosis of the affected joints

    -   May be hereditary, idiopathic, or associated with metabolic
        disorders, including hemochromatosis, hypoparathyroidism,
        osteoarthritis,

> ochronosis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, Wilson's disease, 6
>
> and gout

-   Identiﬁcation of calcium pyrophosphate rhomboidal crystals (strong
    positive birefringence) in the joint ﬂuid is diagnostic; how- ever,

    -   Most frequent in women ages 20--50

    -   Chronic aching pain and stiffness of trunk and extremities,
        > espe- cially around the neck, shoulder, low back, and hips

    -   Elicit pain with mild palpation (enough pressure to blanch your
        > ﬁngernail) at 11 of 18 bilateral tender points: Occiput, low
        > cervi- cal, trapezius, supraspinatus, second rib at

        > infection; despite the pain, this is a nonlethal disease

    -   Patients who improve are those who identify some physical
        > activity they enjoy and can do without exertion

    -   Aspirin, other NSAIDs

    -   Tricyclics offer transient relief related to anti-insomniac

####  Gonococcal Arthritis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Two clinical scenarios: (1) Septic joint with mono- or
        oligoarticular involvement and no skin changes; or (2) a
        systemic process with oligoarticular arthritis, tenosynovitis,
        and characteristic purpuric or pustular skin lesions on the
        distal extremities (commonly called disseminated gonococcal
        infection \[DGI\])

    -   Septic joint variant: White cell count in synovial ﬂuid
        20,000--50,000/μL; synovial ﬂuid Gram's stain and culture more

> likely to be positive 6

-   Systemic presentation variant: Lower synovial cell counts, nega-
    tive Gram stain and culture of joint ﬂuid because signs second- ary
    to inﬂammation due to bacterial debris, not direct infection

-   Urethral, cervical, throat, skin lesion, and rectal cultures on
    > choco- late or Thayer-Martin agar for *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* have
    > higher yield, may be positive in the absence of symptoms

-   Recurrent disseminated gonococcal infection seen with congenital
    complement component deﬁciencies

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Nongonococcal bacterial arthritis

    -   Reactive arthritis; Lyme disease; viral hepatitis

    -   Sarcoidosis; infective endocarditis

    -   Meningococcemia with arthritis

    -   Seronegative spondyloarthropathy

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Obtain Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test and HIV
        testing

    -   Intravenous ceftriaxone or ceftizoxime for 7 days followed by
        oral ceﬁxime or ciproﬂoxacin

    -   Perform washout of joints exhibiting mono-articular septic
        picture.

    -   Avoid NSAIDs early in treatment of DGI. If the arthritis
        improves within 72 hours after initiating antibiotics, the
        diagnosis is DGI; if you treat with both NSAIDs and antibiotics
        you will not know if the improving patient had reactive
        arthritis or DGI

####  Gout 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Especially common among native Paciﬁc Islanders

    -   Broad spectrum of disease, including recurrent arthritic
        > attacks, tophi, interstitial nephropathy, and uric acid
        > nephrolithiasis

    -   First attack typically nocturnal and usually monarticular 90% of
        > time involving the foot, ankle, or knee, with pain "worsened
        > by the weight of the bedsheet"; may become polyarticular with
        > repeated attacks

    -   Affects in descending order of frequency: The ﬁrst metatarsopha-

6 langeal joint (podagra), mid foot, ankle, knee, wrist, elbow; hips

> and shoulders typically spared

-   Hyperuricemia may be primary (caused by overproduction \[10%\] or
    > underexcretion \[90%\] of uric acid) or secondary to diuretic use,
    > cyclosporine, myeloproliferative disorders, multiple myeloma,
    > chronic renal disease

-   After long periods of untreated gout, tophi (monosodium urate
    > deposits with an associated foreign body reaction) develop in sub-
    > cutaneous tissues, cartilage, ears, and other tissues

-   Identiﬁcation of weakly negatively birefringent, needlelike sodium
    > urate crystals in joint ﬂuid or tophi is diagnostic

-   Radiographs early in the course are often negative, but periosti-
    > tis may be detected 2--3 weeks into the course, followed by peri-
    > articular demineralization and erosion of bone

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Rheumatoid arthritis

    -   Ankylosing spondylitis

    -   Arthritis associated with inﬂammatory bowel disease

    -   Reactive arthritis

    -   Juvenile spondyloarthropathy

-   ##### Treatment

    -   NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily)

    -   Sulfasalazine reportedly effective in patients with symmetric
        pol- yarthritis

    -   Intra-articular corticosteroid injection; sterilize skin
        carefully as psoriatic lesions are colonized with staphylococci
        and streptococci

    -   Avoid systemic corticosteroids, which when tapered can trigger a
        ﬂare of pustular psoriasis

    -   Methotrexate useful; institute early

    -   Anti-TNF agents very effective

    -   Treatment of psoriasis helpful in many but not in sacroiliitis

####  Reactive Arthritis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Predominantly diagnosed in young men but also occurs in women
        > (painless vaginal mucosal lesions often not appreciated)

    -   Triad of urethritis, conjunctivitis (or uveitis), and arthritis
        > occur synchronously in 10% of cases (Reiter's syndrome);
        > conjunctivi- tis may be subtle and evanescent

    -   Follows invasive dysenteric infection (with *Shigella,
        > Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter*) or sexually transmitted
        > infection (with

6 *Chlamydia*)

-   Asymmetric, oligoarticular arthritis typically involving the knees
    > and ankles; look for tendinitis and plantar fasciitis

-   Associated with fever, mucocutaneous lesions, stomatitis, optic
    > neuritis, circinate balanitis, prostatitis, keratoderma
    > blennorrhag- icum (nearly indistinguishable from psoriatic
    > lesions), pericardi- tis, and aortic regurgitation

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Severe pain and tenderness, most commonly of the hand or foot,
        associated with vasomotor instability, skin atrophy, edema, and
        hyper- hidrosis; atrophic, nonfunctional hand or foot seen late
        in disease

    -   Usually follows direct trauma to the hand, foot, or knee;
        stroke; peripheral nerve injury; or arthroscopic knee surgery

    -   Shoulder-hand variant with restricted ipsilateral shoulder
        movement

> common after neck or shoulder injuries or after myocardial infarction
> 6

-   Characteristic disparity between degree of injury (usually modest)
    and degree of pain (debilitating)

-   Triple-phase bone scan reveals increased uptake in the early phases
    of the disease; radiographs show severe osteopenia (Sudeck's
    atrophy) late in the course

####  Rheumatoid Arthritis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Disproportionately affects women of child-bearing age

    -   Symmetric, inﬂammatory, destructive polyarthritis of peripheral
        > joints, often involving wrists and hands; ulnar deviation
        > common

    -   Symptoms of stiffness worse with disuse (eg, morning stiffness)

    -   Rheumatoid factor present in up to 85%; 20% of seropositive
        > patients have subcutaneous nodules; presence of antibodies to

6 • Extra-articular manifestations, most common among strongly

> seropositive patients with nodules, include systemic vasculitis, pleu-
> ral exudative effusion (low in glucose), scleritis, sicca symptoms

-   Radiographic ﬁndings include juxta-articular and sometimes gen-

####  Septic Arthritis (Nongonococcal Acute Bacterial Arthritis) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Acute pain, swelling, erythema, warmth, and limited movement of
        joints

    -   Typically monarticular; knee, hip, wrist, shoulder, or ankle
        most often involved

    -   Infection usually occurs via hematogenous seeding of the
        synovium

    -   Previous joint damage (eg, degenerative joint disease, erosive
        arthritis) and intravenous drug abuse predispose

    -   Most common organisms: *Staphylococcus aureus,* group A strepto-
        6

> cocci, *Escherichia coli,* and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Haemophilus
> inﬂuenzae* in children under 5 years of age; *Staphylococcus epi-
> dermidis* after arthroscopy or joint surgery

-   White cell count in synovial ﬂuid \> 25,000/μL; synovial ﬂuid
    culture positive in 50--75%, blood culture in 50%; cell count and
    culture results affected by use of antibiotics by patients before
    presentation

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Gonococcal arthritis

    -   Microcrystalline synovitis

    -   Rheumatoid arthritis

    -   Still's disease

    -   Infective endocarditis (may be associated)

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Intravenous antibiotics should be administered empirically;
        tailor antibiotic selection with culture results to complete
        4--6 weeks of therapy

    -   When orthopedic surgery is available, each septic joint requires
        irrigation and drainage in the operating room; if orthopedic
        sur- gery support unavailable, joint will require serial
        draining proce- dures by needle aspiration

    -   Rest, immobilization, and elevation

    -   Removal of prosthetic joint or other foreign implants to prevent
        development of osteomyelitis

        > neuropsychiatric

6 dysfunction, transverse myelitis, polyneuropathy, interstitial pneu-

> monitis, thyroiditis, cardiac conduction defects

-   More than 50% have cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-Ro (SS-A), and
    > anti-La (SS-B)

-   Decreased lacrimation measured by Schirmer's ﬁlter paper test;
    > biopsy of minor salivary glands of lower lip conﬁrms diagnosis

####  Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Diffuse systemic sclerosis (20%): Proximal skin thickening;
        > inter- stitial lung disease; greater risk of hypertensive
        > renal crisis

    -   Limited disease (80%) or CREST syndrome (calcinosis cutis,

-   ANA abnormal 60% of cases; anticentromere antibody positive in 1% of
    > patients with diffuse scleroderma and 50% of those with limited
    > form; antitopoisomerase I (Scl-70) in one-third of patients with

####  Wegener's Granulomatosis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Vasculitis associated with glomerulonephritis and necrotizing
        granulomas of upper and lower respiratory tracts

    -   Slight male predominance with peak incidence in fourth and ﬁfth
        decades

    -   Ninety percent present with upper or lower respiratory tract
        symp- toms, including perforation of nasal septum, chronic
        sinusitis, otitis media, mastoiditis, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis

    -   Proptosis, scleritis, arthritis, purpura, or neuropathy
        (mononeuri- 6

> tis multiplex) may also be present

-   Cytoplasmic ANCA (C-ANCA) in 90% correlates with anti-- proteinase 3
    antibodies

-   Biopsy in the correct clinical setting yields the diagnosis: Sinus,
    nonspeciﬁc; lung, granulomatous necrotizing vasculitis; renal, focal
    glomerulonephritis

-   Eosinophilia not a feature

-   Chest ﬁlm may reveal large nodular densities; urinalysis may show

    -   Heavy intranasal cocaine use

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Corticosteroids

    -   Primarily oral cyclophosphamide or methotrexate; chronic
        cyclophosphamide therapy predisposes to bladder cancer, and
        therefore signiﬁcant ﬂuid intake during therapy to irrigate the
        bladder is important

####  Hyperosmotic Nonketotic Diabetic Coma 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Gradual onset of polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, and
        weakness; in severe cases, may progress to obtundation and coma

    -   Occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes, typically in elderly
        patients with reduced ﬂuid intake or precipitating factors

    -   Profound hyperglycemia (\> 600 mg/dL), hyperosmolality (\> 310

        > galactorrhea, infertility

    -   Men: Hypogonadism; decreased libido and erectile dysfunction;
        > galactorrhea; infertility

    -   May be caused by primary hypothyroidism or dopamine antagonist

        bruit and exoph- thalmos in Graves' disease

    -   Serum FT~4~ and FT~3~ increased; TSH low or undetectable

    -   Radioiodine uptake scan will differentiate Graves' disease,
        toxic nodule, and thyroiditis; may also be useful in identifying
        rare ectopic thyroid tissue (ovarian teratoma)

        with Graves' disease; chance of remission greater for milder
        cases/smaller goiters, whereas more severe cases may eventually
        require radioactive iodine treatment

    -   Radioactive iodine ablation provides deﬁnitive therapy and is
        indicated for refractory Graves' disease and in patients with
        toxic nodular disease; in older patients or those with severe
        hyperthy- roidism, treat ﬁrst with antithyroid drugs

    -   Subtotal thyroidectomy for failure of medical therapy if
        radioac- tive iodine is contraindicated (eg, pregnancy) or for
        very large nodular goiters; euthyroid state should be achieved
        medically before surgery

    -   Jaundice, pruritus, anorexia, right upper quadrant pain

    -   Hepatomegaly, ascites, right upper quadrant tenderness

    -   Dilated intrahepatic bile ducts by ultrasound or CT scan

    -   Retrograde endoscopic cholangiogram characteristic; tissue
        > biopsy is diagnostic

    -   Hyperbilirubinemia (conjugated), markedly elevated alkaline

####  Bladder Cancer (Transitional Cell Carcinoma) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   More common in men over 40 years of age; predisposing factors
        include smoking, alcohol, occupational exposure to aromatic
        amines, aniline dyes or previous cyclophosphamide therapy; in
        the Middle East and Egypt, chronic *Schistosoma haematobium*
        infec- tion can lead to squamous cell carcinomas of the bladder

    -   Microscopic or gross hematuria with no other symptoms is the
        most common presentation

    -   Suprapubic pain, urgency, and frequency when concurrent infec-
        tion present

    -   Occasional uremia if both ureterovesical oriﬁces obstructed

    -   Tumor visible by cystoscopy

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Other urinary tract tumor

    -   Acute cystitis 9

    -   Renal tuberculosis

    -   Urinary calculi

    -   Glomerulonephritis or interstitial nephritis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Endoscopic transurethral resection for superﬁcial or submucosal
        tumors; intravesical chemotherapy reduces the likelihood of
        recurrence

    -   Radical cystectomy standard with muscle-invasive tumors with
        increasing use of neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy;
        bladder-sparing approaches can be applied to select cases or
        patients unﬁt for surgery

    -   Adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation for completely resected
        patients is generally offered to those at high risk of
        recurrence, though data is conﬂicting on clinical beneﬁt

    -   Combination cisplatin-based chemotherapy for metastatic disease
        has a high response rate and may be curative in a small
        percentage of patients

####  Breast Cancer in Men 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Rare disease but incidence is rising

    -   Men with Klinefelter's syndrome, family history of breast cancer
        > in a female relative, or chest wall irradiation have an
        > increased risk for breast cancer

    -   Painless lump or skin changes of breast

    -   Nipple discharge, bleeding, retraction or ulceration, palpable
        > mass, gynecomastia

    -   Staging as in women

    -   90% express estrogen receptor, and 80% express progesterone
        > receptor; higher rates than in women; but fewer overexpress
        > her2/neu oncogene

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Gynecomastia due to other causes (seen in up to 30% of healthy

9 men)

-   Benign tumor

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ##### Treatment

    -   Modiﬁed radical mastectomy with staging as in women, as well as
        > axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy
        > (for clinically negative nodal disease)

    -   As in female breast cancer, adjuvant hormonal therapy is recom-
        > mended for many with completely resected disease; adjuvant
        > chemotherapy is added for higher-risk disease, including node-
        > positive disease

    -   For metastatic disease, endocrine manipulation (physical or
        > chem- ical castration) with tamoxifen or related compounds,
        > amino- glutethimide, or corticosteroids often quite effective

####  Breast Cancer in Women 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Increased incidence in those with a family history of breast
        cancer and in nulliparous or late-childbearing women

    -   Painless lump, often found by the patient; nipple or skin
        changes over breast (peau d'orange, redness, ulceration) later
        ﬁndings; axillary mass, malaise, or weight loss even later
        ﬁndings

    -   Minority found by mammography

    -   Metastatic disease to lung, bone, or central nervous system may
        dominate clinical picture

    -   Staging based on size of tumor, involvement of lymph nodes, and
        presence of metastases

    -   Extent of involvement of axillary lymph nodes is most powerful
        prognostic indicator in localized disease

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Mammary dysplasia (ﬁbrocystic disease) 9

    -   Benign tumor (ﬁbroadenoma, ductal papilloma)

    -   Fat necrosis

    -   Mastitis

    -   Thrombophlebitis (Mondor's disease) of superﬁcial chest vein

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Resection (lumpectomy plus radiation therapy versus modiﬁed
        radical mastectomy) in early-stage disease

    -   Sentinel lymph node biopsy is preferred over axillary lymph node
        dissection if no clinically positive nodes

    -   Menopausal status, hormone receptor (estrogen and progesterone)
        status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) status
        dictate best adjuvant therapy

    -   Adjuvant hormonal therapy is recommended for many with com-
        pletely resected disease except those at very low risk for
        recur- rence; adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for
        node-positive disease and subset of node-negative disease with
        high-risk features

    -   Metastatic disease is incurable, but treatment with hormonal
        manipulation, chemotherapy, radiation, and monoclonal antibody
        therapy (trastuzumab for HER2-positive disease) may provide
        long-term remission or stabilization

####  Central Nervous System Tumors (Intracranial Tumors) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Prognosis depends on histology; half are gliomas

    -   Most present with generalized or focal disturbances of cerebral
        > function: Generalized symptoms include nocturnal headache,
        > seizures, and projectile vomiting; focal deﬁcits relate to
        > location of the tumor

    -   CT or MRI with gadolinium enhancement deﬁnes the lesion; pos-
        > terior fossa tumors are better visualized by MRI

    -   Biopsy is the deﬁnitive diagnostic procedure, distinguishes
        > primary brain tumors from brain abscess or metastasis

    -   Glioblastoma multiforme: In strictest sense an astrocytoma, but
        > rapidly progressive with a poor prognosis

    -   Astrocytoma: More chronic course than glioblastoma, with a
        > variable prognosis

    -   Medulloblastoma: Seen primarily in children and arises from roof

9 of fourth ventricle

-   Cerebellar hemangioblastoma: Patients usually present with dis-
    > equilibrium and ataxia and occasional erythrocytosis

-   Meningioma: Compresses rather than invades; benign

-   CNS lymphoma: Usually in HIV/AIDS, though may occur rarely in
    > immunocompetent individuals

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ##### Treatment

    -   Treatment depends on the type and site of the tumor and the con-
        > dition of the patient

    -   Maximal resection predicts outcome in most

    -   Radiation postsurgery is mainstay of therapy; newer conformal
        > radiation techniques decrease toxicity to normal brain;
        > temozolomide can be given concurrently

    -   Combination chemotherapy or single-agent temozolomide active in
        > some cases

    -   Herniation treated with intravenous corticosteroids, mannitol,

####  Cervical Cancer 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in almost
        all cases

    -   Abnormal uterine bleeding, vaginal discharge, pelvic or
        abdominal pain

    -   Cervical lesion may be visible on inspection as tumor or
        ulceration

    -   Vaginal cytology is usually positive; must be conﬁrmed by biopsy

    -   CT or MRI of abdomen and pelvis, examination under anesthesia
        useful for staging disease

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Cervicitis

    -   Chronic vaginitis or infection (tuberculosis, actinomycosis)

    -   Sexually transmitted diseases (syphilis, lymphogranuloma
        venereum, chancroid, granuloma inguinale)

    -   Aborted cervical pregnancy 9

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Stage-dependent and requires input of surgeons, medical oncol-
        ogists, and radiation oncologists

    -   Radical or extended hysterectomy curative in patients with
        early- stage disease

    -   For young patients who wish to preserve their fertility, newer
        fertility-sparing surgical approaches are acceptable
        alternatives

    -   Combination of radiation therapy and radiosensitizing chemother-
        apy is curative in majority of patients with localized disease
        not amenable to primary resection

    -   Role of surgery after chemotherapy and radiotherapy still being
        deﬁned

    -   Combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease has signiﬁcant
        response rate, but unclear magnitude of beneﬁt on survival

####  Colorectal Carcinoma 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Risk factors include colonic polyposis, Lynch syndrome (hered-
        itary nonpolyposis colon cancer), and ulcerative colitis

    -   Altered bowel habits, rectal bleeding from left-sided carcinoma;
        occult blood in bowel movements; iron deﬁciency anemia in right-
        sided lesions

    -   Palpable abdominal or rectal mass in minority

    -   Characteristic barium enema or colonoscopic appearance; tissue
        biopsy is diagnostic

    -   Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) useful as marker of dis-
        ease recurrence in patients with elevated CEA at diagnosis but
        is not useful as a diagnostic tool

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Hemorrhoids

    -   Diverticular disease

    -   Benign colonic polyps 9

    -   Peptic ulcer disease

    -   Ameboma

    -   Functional bowel disease

    -   Iron deﬁciency anemia due to other causes

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Surgical resection for cure; can also be done for palliation

    -   Adjuvant chemotherapy recommended for those with signiﬁcant risk
        of recurrence, mainly lymph node positive disease, after surgery

    -   Combination chemotherapy is palliative for distant metastatic
        dis- ease; adding novel agents targeting angiogenesis and growth
        factor pathways has improved response and survival rates

    -   If only limited liver or lung metastasis, resection is
        recommended if feasible, followed by combination chemotherapy

    -   For patients with rectal cancer with high risk features,
        radiation with chemotherapy is given before, and chemotherapy
        alone is given after, surgery

    -   Concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy curative in majority of
        localized anal cancers without need for surgery

    -   The American Gastroenterological Association and US Preventive
        Services Task Force strongly recommend colonoscopy for screening
        due to increasing incidence of right-sided tumors

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Progressive dysphagia initially during ingestion of solid foods,
        later with liquids; progressive weight loss and inanition
        ominous

####  Hepatocellular Carcinoma 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Most common visceral malignancy worldwide; usually asymp-
        tomatic until disease advanced

        matosis are risk factors

    -   Abdominal enlargement, pain, jaundice, weight loss

    -   Hepatomegaly, abdominal mass; rub or bruit heard over right
        upper quadrant in some

    -   Anemia or erythrocytosis; liver function test abnormalities

    -   Dramatic elevation in alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) helpful in
        diagnosis, though signiﬁcant percentage have normal AFPs

    -   Tendency to ascend hepatic vein and inferior vena cava

    -   Angiography (though rarely performed) with characteristic
        abnormality; CT or MRI suggests diagnosis; tissue biopsy for
        conﬁrmation

9

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Benign liver tumors: hemangioma, adenoma, focal nodular
        hyperplasia

    -   Bacterial hepatic abscess

    -   Amebic liver cyst

    -   Metastatic tumor

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Therapeutic options often limited by severe underlying liver
        disease; no surgical option if cirrhosis is present in remainder
        of liver

    -   Surgical resection thought best curative option if lesions are
        resectable and patient is operative candidate

    -   Liver transplant may be curative in small percentage of highly
        selected patients

    -   For unresectable but localized disease, various approaches are
        applied, including radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol
        ablation, transarterial chemoembolization and cryoablation

    -   Sorafenib (multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor) has shown
        modest survival beneﬁt in advanced disease

    -   Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in post-
        > menopausal women, or premenopausal women with resectable
        > disease not candidates for more conservative surgery

    -   Adjuvant chemotherapy for most patients with resected disease

    -   Cytoreductive surgery followed by combination chemotherapy for
        women with advanced disease without distant metastases;
        intraperitoneal and intravenous chemotherapy for patients with

    -   Palpable gallbladder or abdominal mass in some

    -   Elevated amylase with liver function abnormalities; anemia,
        > hyperglycemia, or frank diabetes in minority

    -   Dilated common hepatic ducts by ultrasound or endoscopic ret-

####  Pleural Mesothelioma 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Insidious dyspnea, nonpleuritic chest pain, weight loss

    -   Dullness to percussion, diminished breath sounds, pleural
        friction rub, clubbing

    -   Nodular or irregular unilateral pleural thickening, often with
        effusion by chest radiograph; CT scan often helpful

    -   Pleural biopsy usually necessary for diagnosis, though malignant
        nature of tumor only conﬁrmed by natural history; pleural ﬂuid
        exudative and usually hemorrhagic

    -   Strong association with asbestos exposure, with usual latency
        from time of exposure of 20 years or more

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Empyema

    -   Benign pleural inﬂammatory conditions (posttraumatic,
        asbestosis) 9

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Surgical approaches for localized disease range from palliative
        pleurodesis to attempted curative resection of involved lung and
        pleura

    -   For highly select patients, extrapleural pneumonectomy
        (involving en-bloc resection of lung, pleura, ipsilateral
        diaphragm, and peri- cardium) can be considered along with
        adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy, but entails signiﬁcant risk
        for complications and toxicity

    -   Combination chemotherapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin has
        signiﬁcant response rate and improvement in survival time, but
        response duration still short

    -   One-year mortality rate \> 75%

    -   Polycystic kidney disease; simple cyst

    -   Single complex renal cyst; 70% of these are malignant 9

    -   Renal tuberculosis, calculi, or infarction

    -   Endocarditis

    -   Poor response to traditional chemotherapy or radiation in
        metastatic disease

    -   Low response rate to high-dose interleukin 2, but if achieve
        complete response, long duration of remission; however, toxic
        and only for select good performance status patients

    -   Novel agents, such as antiangiogenesis agents and mammalian
        target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, have improved response
        rate and survival times for metastatic cases

    -   Resection of primary lesion has been documented to result in
        regression of metastases on rare occasions and may improve
        response to subsequent immunotherapy

    tively for selected patients with iodine-avid metastases;
    combination chemotherapy in anaplastic tumors

-   Sorafenib (multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor) showing promise
    in relapsed or refractory metastatic cases

-   Prognosis related to cell type and histology; papillary carcinoma
    offers excellent outlook, anaplastic the worst

-   Medullary thyroid cancer is typically refractory to chemotherapy and
    radiation; associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)
    syndromes; diagnosable by calcitonin elevation

## Genitourinary and Renal Disorders

### GENITOURINARY DISORDERS

####  Bacterial Prostatitis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Acute bacterial prostatitis: Fever, dysuria, urgency, frequency,
        perineal or suprapubic pain; tender prostate; leukocytosis,
        pyuria, bacteriuria, hematuria; caused by *Escherichia coli*
        most com- monly, also *Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia
        trachomatis, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus*

    -   Digital rectal exam essential; avoid vigorous prostatic massage

    -   Chronic prostatitis: Usually in older men, may be asymptomatic;
        in some, urgency and frequency, dysuria, perineal or suprapubic
        pain; prostate boggy, not tender

    -   Expressed prostatic secretions demonstrate increased numbers of
        leukocytes; culture often sterile

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Urethritis; cystitis; prostatodynia

    -   Epididymitis; perirectal abscess; nonbacterial prostatitis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Urinary Gram stain can guide initial therapy; if no Gram stain
        available then treat as outlined below, but urine culture
        results should modify initial treatment

    -   For acute bacterial prostatitis in men under 35 years of age,
        treat for *N. gonorrhoeae* and *C. trachomatis* infection

    -   For acute bacterial prostatitis in men over age 35 years or
        homo- sexual men, treat for Enterobacteriaceae with systemic
        antibiotics

    -   For chronic bacterial prostatitis, treat for Enterobacteriaceae
        with oral antibiotics

    -   Treat symptoms with hot sitz baths, NSAIDs, stool softeners

        > mic- turition, reduced force and caliber of the urinary
        > stream, nocturia, frequency, urgency

    -   Palpably enlarged prostate

    -   Urinalysis and serum creatinine should be obtained

    -   High postvoid residual volume as determined by ultrasonography
        > or excretory urography; not always prognostic of outcome

    -   May be complicated by acute urinary retention or azotemia after
        > prolonged obstruction

        > azole is usually best

    -   Minimize evening ﬂuid intake

    -   Alpha~1~-blockers for symptom relief; 5-α-reductase inhibitors
        (eg, ﬁnasteride) in patients with marked prostatic enlargement

    -   Utilization of symptom scoring instruments to follow success of
        > treatment

    -   Transurethral resection for intolerable symptoms, refractory
        > uri- nary retention, recurrent gross hematuria, and
        > progressive renal insufﬁciency with demonstrated obstruction

-   ##### Pearl

####  Urinary Calculi 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Most common in the stone belt, extending from central Ohio
        > through mid-Florida

    -   Sudden, severe colicky pain localized to the ﬂank, commonly
        > associated with nausea, vomiting, and fever; marked urinary
        > urgency and frequency if stone lodged at ureterovesical
        > junction

    -   Occasionally asymptomatic

    -   Hematuria in 90%, pyuria with concurrent infection; presence of
        > crystals in urine may be diagnostically helpful

    -   Plain ﬁlms of the abdomen (stone seen in 90%), spiral CT, or
        > sonography may be used to visualize location of stone

    -   Depending on the metabolic abnormality (ie, hypercalcemia,
        > hyper- calciuria, hyperuricosuria, hypocitraturia,
        > hyperoxaluria), stones can be composed of calcium oxalate or
        > phosphate (\> 80%), struvite, uric acid, or cystine; more than

        > present with fever, maculopapular rash, eosinophilia, ﬂank
        > pain

    -   Hematuria, pyuria, proteinuria, white blood cell casts, and
        > occa- sionally eosinophils in urine (seen with Hansel's or
        > Wright's stain)

    -   Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis characterized by polyuria
        > and nocturia, salt wasting, small kidneys, isosthenuria; mild
        > protein- uria and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis may also
        > be present

    -   Chronic form may result from prolonged obstruction, analgesic
        > abuse, sickle cell trait, chronic hypercalcemia, uric acid
        > nephropa- thy, or exposure to heavy metals

        with azotemia in severe cases

    -   Urine reveals: Hematuria (with or without dysmorphic red cells
        and red cell casts), proteinuria (usually mild)

    -   Depending on clinical situation, further tests include
        complement levels, antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer,
        antideoxyribonuclease B (anti-DNA B) titer, antinuclear antibody
        (ANA) titers, anti- glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody
        levels, anti- neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA),
        hepatitis B and C antibodies, cryoglobulins, blood cultures;
        renal biopsy establishes the cause

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   IgA nephropathy and Henoch-Schönlein purpura

    -   Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

    -   Goodpasture syndrome (anti-GBM antibody syndrome)

#####  11 

-   ANCA-associated vasculitides (eg, Wegener's granulomatosis,
    microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome)

-   Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis

-   Hepatitis B-- or C--associated glomerulonephritis, other postin-
    fectious glomerulonephritides

-   Infective endocarditis; tubulointerstitial disease

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ##### Treatment

    -   Start with therapy for underlying cause if possible; supportive
        therapy with ﬂuid and sodium restriction, diuretics as needed;
        lower blood pressure slowly to prevent sudden decrease in renal
        perfusion

    -   Steroids and cytotoxic agents are used for rapidly progressive
        glomerulonephritis, more effective at higher GFRs

    -   Plasmapheresis occasionally of value in anti-GBM and ANCA-
        related disease

####  Acute Kidney Injury 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Most commonly caused by acute tubular necrosis (ATN)

    -   Nausea, vomiting, mental status changes, edema, hypertension

    -   History can include exposure to nephrotoxic agents, sepsis,
        > trauma, surgery, shock, or hemorrhage

    -   Oliguria is a poor prognostic sign

    -   Pericardial friction rub, asterixis may be present with uremia

    -   Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, decreased serum bicarbonate

    -   Kidneys of normal size or enlarged on imaging studies; small
        > kidneys or renal osteodystrophy suggests chronic renal failure

    -   Urinalysis with manual microscopy can guide diagnostic approach;
        > ATN with pigmented granular casts; acute glomeru- lonephritis
        > and interstitial nephritis as previously described

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Prerenal azotemia (eg, hypovolemia, heart failure, cirrhosis)

    -   Intrinsic causes (eg, tubulointerstitial, glomerular, vascular)

    -   Postrenal azotemia (eg, obstructive uropathy)

11

-   #####  Treatment

    -   Volume resuscitation with isotonic ﬂuid for hypovolemia

    -   Ultrasonography to rule out obstructive process

    -   Renal biopsy (when glomerulonephritis suspected or etiology
        > unknown)

    -   Supportive care for uncomplicated cases: Minimize ﬂuid intake,
        > follow potassium, phosphorus, and bicarbonate levels

    -   Oliguric kidney injury with worse prognosis than a nonoliguric
        > process; role of diuretics to convert to latter process
        > unproven

    -   Dialysis for ﬂuid overload, hyperkalemia, pericarditis, uremia

    -   Adjust dosage of renally metabolized medications

    -   Avoid contrast exposure; volume repletion and N-acetylcysteine

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Triad of pulmonary hemorrhage with hemoptysis, circulating anti-
        GBM antibody, and glomerulonephritis due to anti-GBM

    -   Most common in young (18--30) and middle-aged (50--60s) white
        men; smokers also have a predilection

    -   Extrarenal manifestations may be absent

    -   On immunoﬂuorescence, renal biopsy reveals linear deposition of
        IgG with or without C3 deposition along the GBM

    -   Serum anti-GBM antibody is pathognomonic

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Wegener's granulomatosis

    -   Polyarteritis nodosa

    -   SLE

    -   Endocarditis

    -   Postinfectious glomerulonephritis

    -   Primary pulmonary hemorrhage

-   ##### Treatment

> 11

-   Plasmapheresis to remove circulating anti-GBM antibody

-   Prednisone and cyclophosphamide for at least 3 months

-   Recovery of renal function more likely if treatment is begun before
    serum creatinine reaches 6--7 mg/dL; hemodialysis as necessary

-   Renal transplant delayed for 12 months after disappearance of anti-
    body from the serum

####  Asymptomatic Bacteriuria 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   History of recurring urinary tract infections may be present

    -   Bacteriuria with absence of symptoms or signs referable to the
        > uri- nary tract

    -   May be associated with obstruction, anatomic or neurologic
        > abnor- malities, pregnancy, indwelling catheter, urologic
        > procedures, diverted urinary stream (eg, ileal loop conduit),
        > diabetes mellitus, or old age

    -   Usually caused by Enterobacteriaceae, *Pseudomonas,* or
        > enterococci

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Drug-induced nephropathy, especially analgesics

    -   Contaminated urine specimen

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Indications for treatment include pregnancy, persistent
        > bacteriuria in certain patients and before urologic procedures

    -   Urine culture to guide antimicrobial therapy if treatment war-
        > ranted

####  Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Numerous causes, especially diabetes, hypertension; asympto-
        matic early

    -   National Kidney Foundation classiﬁcation is useful: Stage I: GFR
        \> 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2^ plus kidney damage

> Stage II: GFR 60--89 mL/min/1.73 m^2^ plus kidney damage Stage III:
> GFR 30--59 mL/min/1.73 m^2^
>
> Stage IV: GFR 15--29 mL/min/1.73 m^2^ Stage V: GFR \< 15 mL/min/1.73
> m^2^

-   Advanced dysfunction with volume overload, hypertension, meta- bolic
    acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, anemia,
    CKD-related mineral and bone disorder

-   Uremia: anorexia, nausea, hiccups, confusion, pericarditis

-   Benign urinary sediment; bilateral shrunken kidneys in most

-   Attention to comorbid factors, especially cardiovascular disease, as
    well as hyperlipidemia, anemia, and bone disease

-   Low-protein diet, salt and water restriction for patients with
    hyper- tension and edema

-   Potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium restriction once GFR is below
    30--60 mL/min; phosphorus binders for associated hyper- phosphatemia
    with avoidance of chronic aluminum hydroxide if possible; calcium
    and vitamin D supplements to prevent osteodystrophy

-   Erythropoietin after iron repletion and excluding other causes of
    anemia; bicarbonate therapy for chronic metabolic acidosis

-   In progressive disease, referral for dialysis or renal
    transplantation

####  Diabetic Nephropathy 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   20--30% of diabetics have microalbuminuria approximately 15
        > years after diabetes mellitus ﬁrst diagnosed

    -   Diabetic retinopathy often present

    -   GFR increases initially, returns to normal as further renal
        > damage occurs, then continues to fall

    -   Proteinuria \> 1 g/d, often nephrotic range

    -   Normal to enlarged kidneys on ultrasound

    -   Biopsy can show mesangial matrix expansion, diffuse glomeru-
        > losclerosis, and nodular intercapillary glomerulosclerosis,
        > the latter pathognomonic

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Nephrotic syndrome due to other cause, especially amyloidosis

    -   Glomerulonephritis with nephrotic features such as that seen in

####  Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   May be primary (idiopathic) or secondary (physiologic response
        to hyperﬁltration or glomerular hypertrophy as in disorders with
        decreased renal mass such as unilateral renal agenesis, after
        nephrectomy, massive obesity, reﬂux nephropathy; or nonspeciﬁc
        healing from prior inﬂammatory injury)

    -   Other causes include familial forms, toxin related (heroin),
        infec- tions (HIV)

    -   Along with membranous nephropathy, most common cause of
        nephrotic syndrome in nondiabetic adults

    -   Primary form often presents with acute nephrotic syndrome:
        Proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, hyperlipidemia

    -   Secondary forms often asymptomatic, presenting with non-
        nephrotic proteinuria and slowly progressive kidney disease

    -   Depending on the history, further tests may include serologies
        (HIV), renal ultrasound, and renal biopsy

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Membranous nephropathy; diabetic nephropathy

    -   Minimal change disease; amyloid; IgA nephropathy

#####  11 

-   Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (later stages)

-   Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ##### Treatment

    -   General measures similar to those for nephrotic syndrome, espe-
        cially use of ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker for
        pro- teinuria and lipid-lowering agents for hyperlipidemia

    -   Steroid treatment initially for symptomatic idiopathic focal
        seg- mental glomerulosclerosis; favorable prognosis for complete
        or partial responders

    -   Steroid resistance associated with poor renal prognosis; addi-
        tional therapy with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate
        mofetil, cytotoxic agents (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil), or
        plasmapheresis

####  IgA Nephropathy (Berger's Disease) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Most common form of acute and chronic glomerulonephritis in
        Caucasians and Asians

    -   Secondary causes include hepatic cirrhosis, celiac disease,
        inﬂam- matory bowel disease, dermatitis herpetiformis,
        psoriasis, mini- mal change disease

    -   First episode: Macroscopic hematuria, often associated with a
        viral infection, with or without upper respiratory ("synpharyn-
        gitic") and gastrointestinal symptoms

    -   Malaise, fatigue, myalgias, hypertension, edema may be present

    -   Recurrent hematuria and mild proteinuria over decades, with same
        precipitants

    -   Often detected incidentally with microscopic hematuria

    -   Serum IgA increased in 30--50%; renal biopsy reveals inﬂamma-
        tion and deposition of IgA with or without C3 and IgM in the
        mesangium of all glomeruli

    -   Usually indolent; 20--30% of patients progress to end-stage
        renal disease over 2--3 decades

    -   Can be the initial presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus

    -   WHO classiﬁcation of renal biopsy: Normal renal biopsy (class
        > I); mesangial proliferation (class II); focal proliferation
        > (class III); dif- fuse proliferation (class IV); membranous
        > (class V)

    -   Proteinuria or hematuria of glomerular origin; hypocomple-
        > mentemia common

    -   Glomerular ﬁltration rate need not be depressed

    -   Chronic tubulointerstitial changes on biopsy portend a worse
        > prognosis

    -   Steroids and cytotoxic agents for severe class III or any class
        > IV; treatment for class V is still debatable

    -   Early treatment of renal relapses may prevent severe ﬂare

    -   Repeat biopsy for ﬂare of renal disease; lupus nephritis can

        rheuma- toid arthritis; systemic infections such as hepatitis B
        or C)

    -   Anorexia, dyspnea, foamy urine; anasarca

    -   Proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia

    -   Hypercoagulability due to anticoagulant urinary loss; hematuria
        in half

    -   Renal ultrasound; renal biopsy to establish diagnosis

    -   Limit malignancy evaluation to age-appropriate screening or
        eval- uation of abnormalities from history and physical

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis

    -   Diabetic nephropathy

    -   Minimal change disease

    -   Amyloidosis

    -   Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis

-   ##### Treatment

> 11

-   General measures similar to those for nephrotic syndrome, further
    therapies reserved for idiopathic cases only

-   Spontaneous or partial (≤ 2 g/d proteinuria) remission in 70%; thus
    if nonnephrotic proteinuria and asymptomatic, or symptoms of edema
    easily controlled, observe without treatment

-   Risk factors for progressive disease: Men \> age 50 years, pro-
    teinuria \> 6 g/d, abnormal renal function at presentation, and
    tubulointerstitial disease on biopsy; active therapy with steroids
    and cytotoxic agent (cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil)

-   Alternative agents in selected cases: Cyclosporine, mycophenolate
    mofetil, azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulin

-   Good long-term prognosis after spontaneous or drug-induced
    remission, although relapses may occur in one-quarter of cases

####  Obstructive Nephropathy 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Most cases are postvesical and usually of prostatic origin

    -   A few cases result from bilateral ureteral obstruction, usually
        > from stones, which can present with sudden pain

    -   Obstruction may be acute or chronic, partial or complete

    -   Postvesical obstruction presents with nocturia, incontinence,
        > malaise, nausea, with normal 24-hour urine output, but in
        > swings

    -   Palpable bladder, suprapubic pain

    -   Renal insufﬁciency, hypertension may be present

    -   Renal ultrasound localizes site of obstruction with proximal
        > tract dilation and hydronephrosis

    -   Spectrum of causes includes anatomic abnormalities, stricture,
        > retroperitoneal or pelvic tumor, prostatic hypertrophy,
        > bilateral renal stones, drug effect (eg, anticholinergics,
        > opioids), and neu- romuscular disorders

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Prerenal azotemia

    -   Interstitial nephritis

11

-   Acute or chronic kidney disease due to any cause

    -   ##### Treatment

        -   Urinary catheter or ultrasonography to rule out obstruction
            > sec- ondary to enlarged prostate

        -   Nephrostomy tubes if signiﬁcant bilateral hydronephrosis
            > present with bilateral ureteral obstruction

        -   Treatment of concurrent infection if present

        -   Observe for postobstructive diuresis; can be brisk

    -   ##### Pearl

####  Polycystic Kidney Disease 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Autosomal-dominant inheritance and nearly complete penetrance,
        thus strikingly positive family history (autosomal-recessive
        form rare, usually discovered in childhood)

    -   Abdominal or ﬂank pain associated with hematuria, frequent uri-
        nary tract infections, nephrolithiasis

    -   Hypertension, large palpable kidneys, positive family history

    -   Renal insufﬁciency in 50% of patients by age 70 years; unlikely
        to develop renal disease if no cystic renal lesions by age 30
        years

    -   Normal or elevated hematocrit common: Interstitial cells near
        cysts may elaborate erythropoietin

    -   Diagnosis conﬁrmed by multiple renal cysts on ultrasonography or
        CT scan

    -   Increased incidence of cerebral aneurysms (10% of affected
        patients), aortic aneurysms, and abnormalities of the mitral
        valve; 40--50% have concomitant hepatic cysts; colonic
        diverticula; abdominal wall hernias

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Renal cell carcinoma

#####  11 

-   Simple renal cysts

-   Other causes of chronic kidney disease

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ##### Treatment

    -   Treat hypertension and nephrolithiasis

    -   Observe for urinary tract infection; if present, may require
        pro- longed treatment

    -   Avoid high-protein diet

    -   Patients with family history of cerebral aneurysm should have
        screening cerebral CT or MR angiography

    -   Occasional nephrectomy required for repeated episodes of pain
        and infection or before transplant for very large kidneys

    -   Excellent outcome with transplant

####  Renal Tubular Acidosis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Unexplained metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap

    -   Type I (distal): Impaired urinary acidiﬁcation, plasma bicarbon-
        > ate may be \< 10--15 mEq/L, hypokalemia, abnormal (positive)
        > uri- nary anion gap; may be familial or secondary to
        > autoimmune disease, obstructive uropathy, drugs (eg,
        > amphotericin B), hyper- globulinemia, hypercalciuria, renal
        > transplantation, or sickle cell anemia

    -   Type II (proximal): Bicarbonaturia with serum bicarbonate usu-
        > ally 12--20 mEq/L, hypokalemia, often with Fanconi's syndrome
        > (glycosuria, aminoaciduria, phosphaturia, uricosuria, and
        > tubular proteinuria); may be secondary to myeloma, drugs, or
        > renal trans- plant

    -   Type IV: Low renin and aldosterone; impaired ammoniagenesis with
        > serum bicarbonate usually \> 17 mEq/L; hyperkalemia, abnor-
        > mal (positive) urinary anion gap; typical of renal
        > insufﬁciency; others due to diabetes mellitus, drugs (eg, ACE
        > inhibitors, NSAIDs, cyclosporine), tubulointerstitial disease,
        > or nephroscle- rosis

11

-   #####  Differential Diagnosis

    -   Diarrhea

    -   Ileal loop constriction after surgery for bladder cancer

    -   Hypokalemia or hyperkalemia from other causes

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Discontinue offending drug or treat underlying disease if
        > present

    -   Bicarbonate or citrate and potassium replacement for types I and
        > II

    -   Vitamin D and phosphate supplementation for type I to prevent
        > osteomalacia, not type II because of possible hypercalcemia
        > and further damage to the distal tubule

    -   Thiazides may increase bicarbonate reabsorption for type II

    -   Fludrocortisone for type IV only if volume repletion is difﬁcult

####  Uric Acid and Kidney Disease 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Three distinct syndromes, as described below; terminology
        confusing

    -   Uric acid nephrolithiasis: Radiolucent urate stones in 3% of
        patients with gout

    -   Gouty kidney (chronic urate nephropathy): Interstitial sodium
        urate crystals of uncertain signiﬁcance in patients with gout
        and interstitial nephropathy; no clear correlation with degree
        of ele- vation of serum uric acid

    -   Uric acid nephropathy: Uric acid sludge within nephron due to
        cel- lular necrosis, typically after chemotherapy or radiation
        has induced rapid cell lysis

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Kidney disease due to other cause

    -   Hypertensive nephrosclerosis

    -   Nephrolithiasis due to other cause

    -   Myeloma kidney

-   ##### Treatment

> 11

-   Depends on syndrome

-   Intravenous hydration and alkalinization of urine for uric acid
    stones

-   Pretreatment with allopurinol and intravenous hydration for selected
    patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome; maintain urine pH \> 6.5
    and urine output \> 2 L/d

-   In patients with gout, allopurinol and colchicine adjusted for renal
    function; NSAID use minimized in patients with renal dysfunction

-   Uricase prophylaxis in high-risk patients or treatment of acute uric
    acid nephropathy

## Neurologic Diseases

####  Arteriovenous Malformations 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Congenital vascular malformations that consist of arteriovenous
        communications without intervening capillaries

    -   Patients typically under age 30 years and normotensive

    -   Unruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) present inci-
        dentally or with headache or seizure; ruptured AVMs present with
        acute headache, seizure, hemiparesis, or coma

    -   May also present as transverse myelopathy (spinal cord
        arteriove- nous malformation)

    -   Non-contrast CT of the brain will show blood in cases of
        > rupture; CT or MRI with contrast will show tangle of blood
        > vessels; angiography characteristically diagnostic

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Dural arteriovenous ﬁstulas

    -   Cavernous malformation

    -   Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage

    -   Ruptured intracranial aneurysm

    -   Intracranial tumor

    -   Brain abscess

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Ruptured AVMs have a high risk of re-rupture and are usually
        > excised; treatment of patients with unruptured AVMs depends on
        > symptoms and neurologic risk of surgery

    -   Endovascular embolization in selected malformations

    -   Radiosurgery for small malformations

    -   Ongoing clinical trial is comparing surgery with watchful wait-

> ing for unruptured AVMs (study name is "ARUBA")

####  Bell's Palsy (Idiopathic Facial Paresis) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   An idiopathic facial paresis

    -   Abrupt onset of hemifacial weakness including the forehead, dif-
        ﬁculty closing eye; ipsilateral ear pain may precede or
        accompany weakness

    -   Examination shows unilateral peripheral seventh nerve palsy;
        taste lost on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, eye
        irritation due to decreased lacrimation and hyperacusis may
        occur; absence of other neurologic signs

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Basilar meningitis, especially that associated with sarcoidosis

    -   Lyme disease

    -   First of multiple cranial neuropathies

    -   Guillain-Barré syndrome

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Treatment with corticosteroids is beneﬁcial when initiated early
        (48--72 hours)

    -   Antiviral agents (eg, acyclovir, valacyclovir) probably not
        helpful

#####  12 

-   Supportive measures with frequent eye lubrication and nocturnal eye
    patching

-   Only 10% of patients are dissatisﬁed with the ﬁnal outcome of their
    disability or disﬁgurement

####  Brain Abscess 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   History of sinusitis, otitis, endocarditis, chronic pulmonary
        infec- tion, or congenital heart defect common

    -   Headache, focal neurologic symptoms, seizures may occur

    -   Examination may show hemiparesis, sensory loss, visual ﬁeld cut,
        aphasia, ataxia depending on location of lesion

    -   The most common organisms are streptococci, staphylococci, and
        anaerobes; *Toxoplasma* in AIDS patients; commonly polymicrobial

    -   Tuberculosis can also cause an isolated ring-enhancing lesion

    -   Ring-enhancing lesion on CT scan or MRI; lumbar puncture

####  Combined System Disease (Posterolateral Sclerosis) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Numbness (pins and needles), tenderness, weakness; feeling of
        heaviness in toes, feet, ﬁngers, and hands

    -   Stocking and glove distribution of sensory loss in some patients

    -   Extensor plantar response and hyperreﬂexia typical, as is loss
        of position and vibratory senses

    -   May develop myelopathy in severe cases

    -   Serum vitamin B~12~ level low; methylmalonic acid and homocys-
        teine levels high

    -   Megaloblastic anemia may be present but does not parallel neu-
        rologic dysfunction

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Approximately two-thirds of cases are preceded by a respiratory
        tract or gastrointestinal infection, often *Campylobacter
        jejuni* enteritis

    -   Pathophysiology thought to be molecular mimicry with antibodies
        > raised against an infectious organism cross reacting with
        > nerve tissue

    -   Progressive, usually ascending, symmetric weakness with are-
        > ﬂexia and variable paresthesia or dysesthesia; autonomic
        > involve- ment (eg, cardiac irregularities, hypertension, or
        > hypotension) may be prominent

    -   Spinal imaging (both of cervical and lumbar spine) is often nec-
        essary to rule out myelopathy or cauda equina syndrome, espe-
        cially if there is bowel or bladder involvement

    -   Electromyography consistent with demyelinating injury; also a
        > less common axonal form with worse prognosis for full recovery

    -   Lumbar puncture shows high protein, normal cell count

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Myelopathy or cauda equina syndrome of any cause

####  Hemorrhagic Stroke 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Risk factors: Hypertension, excessive alcohol use, cocaine and
        methamphetamine abuse, antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy

    -   Sudden onset of neurologic deﬁcit, variably including focal
        > weak- ness, sensory abnormalities, visual ﬁeld cut, aphasia,
        > or altered mentation; often with headache

    -   CT of the head will show intracranial hemorrhage immediately;
        MRI, MR angiogram, or catheter angiogram is often necessary to
        exclude an arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, or underlying
        tumor

    -   Check prothrombin time and platelet count immediately

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Head trauma

    -   If present, reversal of coagulopathy should be considered with
        factor IX complex or fresh-frozen plasma and vitamin K;
        platelets can be transfused if thrombocytopenic

    -   Neurosurgical decompression often indicated for cerebellar
        hemorrhage

    -   An external ventricular drain may be necessary for hydrocephalus
        or intracranial pressure monitoring

    -   Blood pressure is usually lowered acutely

####  Huntington's Disease 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Family history usually present (autosomal dominant with antici-
        > pation)

    -   Onset at age 30--50 years, with gradual progressive chorea and
        > dementia; death usually occurs within 20 years after onset

    -   Caused by a CAG trinucleotide-repeat expansion in a gene located
        on the short arm of chromosome 4 that encodes the pro- tein
        huntingtin

    -   The earliest mental changes are often behavioral, including
        depres- sion, emotional lability, delusions and hypersexuality

    -   CT/MRI scan shows cerebral atrophy, particularly in the caudate

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

####  Idiopathic Epilepsy 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Epilepsy is the tendency toward recurrent seizures

    -   Seizures are paroxysmal, transitory alterations of central
        nervous system function; may be generalized or focal with or
        without alter- ation of consciousness

    -   Metabolic panel to rule out sodium, glucose, or calcium
        disorders; urine toxicology screen; antiepileptic drug levels
        may be helpful

    -   CT or MRI important to rule out structural lesion; lumbar punc-
        > ture important to rule out meningitis or encephalitis

    -   Characteristic electroencephalography during seizures; often
        abnormal during interictal periods

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Syncope; migraine; narcolepsy; hypoglycemia

    -   Stroke (when patient ﬁrst seen postictally) or transient
        > ischemic attack (TIA); psychiatric abnormalities
        > (pseudoseizures, panic attack)

-   ##### Treatment

    -   For newly diagnosed epilepsy, multiple options (eg,
        carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, for initial monotherapy)

    -   Other newer-generation anticonvulsants and phenobarbital may be

> helpful in patients unresponsive to other medications

#####  12 

-   Valproic acid should be avoided in women considering pregnancy

-   Status epilepticus is treated as a medical emergency with intra-
    > venous diazepam or lorazepam and fosphenytoin

####  Intracranial Aneurysms and Subarachnoid Hemorrhage 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Synonymous with berry aneurysm

    -   Asymptomatic until expansion or rupture; sometimes preceded by
        abrupt onset of headaches that resolve (sentinel leaks)

    -   Rupture characterized by sudden, severe headache ("the worst
        > headache of my life"), confusion, photophobia, and vomiting

    -   Focal neurologic signs unusual except for third nerve palsy with
        posterior communicating artery aneurysm

    -   CT scan is 95% sensitive for subarachnoid blood in the ﬁrst 24
        hours, less sensitive thereafter; a lumbar puncture looking for
        blood is the deﬁnitive test; cerebral catheter angiography indi-
        cates size, location, and number of aneurysms

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage

    -   Ruptured arteriovenous malformation

    -   Ruptured mycotic aneurysm; brain tumor

    -   Vasculitis; migraine headache; meningitis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Deﬁnitive therapy with surgical clipping or endovascular coil

12

embolization of aneurysm to prevent re-rupture; re-rupture asso-

> ciated with high mortality

-   Nimodipine (calcium channel blocker) may improve outcome

-   Aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation, induced hypertension, and intracra-
    > nial angioplasty may be useful for treating vasospasm after sub-
    > arachnoid hemorrhage

-   An external ventricular drain is often necessary to treat
    > hydrocephalus

-   Monitor sodium closely for cerebral salt wasting; fluid restric-
    tion is contraindicated in subarachnoid hemorrhage so hypona- tremia
    is treated with hypertonic saline or sodium tablets

-   Small unruptured aneurysms may not require treatment

        terolemia, carotid atherosclerosis, valvular heart disease,
        atrial ﬁbrillation

    -   Sudden onset of neurologic deﬁcit, may include focal weakness,
        sensory defects, visual ﬁeld cut, aphasia, confusion

    -   If stroke-like symptoms resolve in \< 24 hours, deﬁned as a
        tran- sient ischemic attack (TIA)

    -   CT of the head is necessary to rule out hemorrhage; may not show
        ischemia in the ﬁrst 24 hours but hemorrhage visible
        immediately; MRI a superior imaging modality, especially in
        posterior fossa

    -   Etiology may be cardioembolic, artery-to-artery embolus, or
        > thrombotic

    -   ECG or telemetry to rule out atrial ﬁbrillation; carotid imaging
        to rule out stenosis; echo to rule out patent foramen ovale

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Hemorrhagic stroke; subarachnoid hemorrhage

    -   Seizure (and postictal state); migraine; vasculitis

    -   Subdural or epidural hematoma

    -   Primary or metastatic brain tumor

    -   Multiple sclerosis; neurosyphilis

#####  12 

-   Any metabolic abnormality, especially hypoglycemia

```
-   ##### Treatment

    -   Tissue plasminogen activator for selected patients with ischemic
        stroke who can be treated within 4.5 hours after onset

    -   Secondary prevention with aspirin, clopidogrel, or the combina-
        tion of dipyridamole and aspirin for all ischemic stroke or TIA
        without an indication for anticoagulation

    -   Anticoagulation for stroke or TIA due to atrial ﬁbrillation,
        metal heart valve

    -   Control of risk factors, especially hypertension, hypercholes-
        terolemia, and tobacco use

####  Migraine Headache 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Onset usually in adolescence or early adulthood

    -   May be triggered by stress, foods (chocolate, red wine), smells
        (eg, perfume, car exhaust), dehydration, lack of sleep, menses

    -   Common migraine: Lasts 4--72 hours, unilateral, throbbing, mod-
        > erate to severe intensity, aggravated by routine physical
        > activity, associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia,
        > phonophobia

    -   Classic migraine (only approximately 20% of cases): Same symp-
        > toms as common migraine with a prodrome (aura) that includes a
        > homonymous visual disturbance, unilateral numbness, pares-
        > thesias, or weakness

    -   Basilar variant: Brainstem and cerebellar ﬁndings followed by
        > occipital headache

    -   Ophthalmic variant: Painless loss of vision, scotomas, usually
        > unilateral

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Cluster headache or other trigeminal autonomic cephalgia

    -   Giant cell arteritis

    -   Subarachnoid hemorrhage

    -   Mass lesion (eg, tumor or abscess)

12

-   Meningitis

    -   Increased intracranial pressure of other cause

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ##### Treatment

    -   Avoidance of triggers

    -   Acute treatment: Triptans, ergotamine with caffeine, NSAIDs
        > (preferably at onset of prodrome)

    -   Prophylaxis should be considered for more than three migraines
        per month and includes propranolol, amitriptyline, verapamil,
        valproic acid, and many others

####  Multiple Sclerosis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Patient usually under 50 years of age at onset

    -   Episodic symptoms that may include sensory abnormalities,
        blurred vision due to optic neuritis, urinary sphincter
        disturbances, and upper motor neuron weakness; 15% are steadily
        progressive from onset (primary progressive)

    -   Diagnosis can be made if there are two clinical deﬁcits
        > separated by time and space with supportive imaging data;
        > multiple foci in white matter best demonstrated
        > radiographically by MRI

    -   Finding of oligoclonal bands or elevated IgG index on lumbar
        > puncture is a nonspeciﬁc marker of inﬂammation

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Vasculitis or systemic lupus erythematosus

    -   Small vessel ischemic disease; B~12~ deﬁciency

    -   Neurosyphilis, Lyme disease, HIV-related illness, human
        T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)

    -   Primary or metastatic central nervous system neoplasm

    -   Optic neuritis due to other causes

    -   Cord compression, radiculopathy due to mechanical compression

-   ##### Treatment

> 12

-   Beta-interferon and glatiramer acetate reduce exacerbation rate

-   Natalizumab also reduces exacerbation rate but carries risk of
    > progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy

-   Other immunosuppressants, including mitoxantrone, may be effective

-   Steroids may hasten recovery from relapses, but do not change
    > long-term disability

-   Symptomatic treatment of spasticity and bladder dysfunction

####  Myasthenia Gravis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Due to autoimmune destruction of acetylcholine receptors at the
        > neuromuscular junction; often associated with other autoimmune
        > conditions such as Graves' disease

    -   Fatigable weakness of most-commonly used muscles: Diplopia,
        dysphagia, ptosis, facial weakness with chewing and speaking;
        sensation and reﬂexes are preserved

    -   Electromyography and nerve conduction studies demonstrate
        > decremental muscle response with repetitive stimulation at 3
        > Hz

    -   Elevated acetylcholine receptor antibody assay conﬁrmatory but
        > not completely sensitive; some have antibodies to MuSK

    -   Chest CT is necessary to rule out thymoma

    -   Any infection and some medications can exacerbate myasthenia and
        > precipitate myasthenic crisis, characterized by neuromuscu-
        > lar respiratory failure

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Botulism; Lambert-Eaton syndrome

    -   Drug-induced myasthenia (penicillamine)

    -   Motor neuropathy due to other causes

    -   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

12

-   Primary myopathy (eg, polymyositis)

    -   Bulbar poliomyelitis; thyrotoxicosis

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ##### Treatment

    -   Avoid medications that are known to worsen myasthenia (eg,
        aminoglycosides)

    -   Anticholinesterase drugs (eg, pyridostigmine) provide sympto-
        > matic beneﬁt

    -   Consider thymectomy in an otherwise healthy patient under age 60
        > years if weakness not restricted to extraocular muscles

    -   Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants if response to above
        measures not ideal

####  Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Subacute loss of higher cognitive function

    -   Urinary incontinence

    -   Gait apraxia

    -   In some, history of head trauma or meningitis

    -   Normal opening pressure on lumbar puncture

    -   Enlarged ventricles without atrophy by CT or MRI

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   High pressure hydrocephalus

    -   Alzheimer's or other dementia

    -   Parkinson's disease

    -   Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration

    -   Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome

    -   Chronic meningitis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Lumbar puncture provides temporary amelioration of symptoms

    -   Ventriculoperitoneal shunting, most effective when precipitating
        event is identiﬁed and recent; gait is most likely symptom to
        improve

12

-   ##### Pearl

####  Parkinson's Disease 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Insidious onset in older patient of pill-rolling tremor (3--5
        > Hz), rigidity, bradykinesia, and progressive postural
        > instability; tremor is the least disabling feature

    -   Masklike facies, cogwheeling of extremities on passive motion;
        > cutaneous seborrhea characteristic

    -   Absence of tremor---not uncommon---may delay diagnosis

    -   Mild intellectual deterioration often noted, but concurrent
        Alzheimer's disease may account for this in many

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Essential tremor; hypothyroidism; depression

    -   Phenothiazine, metoclopramide toxicity; also carbon monoxide,
        > manganese poisoning

    -   Multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy

    -   Dementia with Lewy bodies; small-vessel ischemic disease

    -   Repeated head trauma; normal pressure hydrocephalus

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Carbidopa-levodopa, dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropini-
        > role), or MAO-B inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline) are all
        > reason-

12

able as ﬁrst-line therapy

-   No treatment necessary in early disease if symptoms not bother- some
    > or disabling

-   Carbidopa-levodopa is most effective treatment for disabling
    > symptoms; dopamine agonists and MAO-B inhibitors may permit
    > reduction of carbidopa-levodopa dose; anticholinergics and aman-
    > tadine also useful adjuncts

-   Catechol *O*-methyl transferase inhibitors (entacapone) are useful
    > to extend the duration of carbidopa-levodopa effect

-   Selected patients with good cognitive function who have a good
    > response to levodopa but have dose-limiting side effects are

####  Periodic Paralysis Syndromes 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Episodes of ﬂaccid weakness or paralysis with strength normal
        between attacks

    -   Hypokalemic variety: Infrequent, prolonged, severe attacks; usu-
        ally upon awakening, during rest after exercise, or after
        carbohy- drate meals; typically autosomal dominant but can be
        associated with hyperthyroidism, especially in Asian men

    -   Hyperkalemic or normokalemic variety: Frequent, short-duration,
        less severe attacks often with rest after exercise or during
        fasting; autosomal dominant

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Myasthenia gravis

    -   Polyneuropathies due to other causes, especially Guillain-Barré
        syndrome

    -   Seizure

    -   Myopathy, especially metabolic myopathies

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Hypokalemic variant: Potassium replacement for acute episode;
        low-carbohydrate, low-salt diet chronically, acetazolamide pro-

> phylactically; treatment of hyperthyroidism, when associated,

#####  12 

reduces attacks, as does therapy with propranolol

-   Hyperkalemic-normokalemic variant: Intravenous calcium, intra-
    venous diuretics useful for acute therapy; prophylactic acetazo-
    lamide beneﬁcial

####  Peripheral Neuropathy 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Exam shows sensory loss, lower motor neuron weakness, atrophy,
        > and normal to decreased tone; diminished reﬂexes dependant on
        > the nerves involved

    -   Polyneuropathies: Distal, symmetric (often subacute, slowly pro-
        gressive) abnormalities of sensation, strength, or both usually
        sec- ondary to metabolic, toxic, or inherited disorders

    -   Mononeuropathies: Dysfunction of a single nerve (eg, carpal
        > tunnel syndrome) usually secondary to focal nerve compression
        > or stretch

    -   Mononeuritis multiplex: Multiple individual nerves affected
        > asym- metrically either at the same time or stepwise, usually
        > secondary to inﬂammatory disorders; requires workup for
        > vasculitis

    -   Electromyography and nerve conduction studies can be helpful
        > extension of neurologic exam

####  Syringomyelia 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Expansion of the central canal of the spinal cord results in
        destruc- tion or degeneration of the adjacent gray and white
        matter

    -   Initial loss of pain and temperature sense with preservation of
        other sensory function, often in a cape-like distribution over
        the shoulders and lateral arms and hands; unrecognized burning
        or injury of hands a characteristic presentation

    -   Weakness, hyporeﬂexia or areﬂexia, atrophy of muscles at level
        > of spinal cord involvement (usually upper limbs and hands);

####  Trigeminal Neuralgia (Tic Douloureux) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Characterized by momentary episodes of lancinating facial pain
        in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, usually the second
        or third division

    -   Commonly affects women more than men in middle and later life

    -   Triggered by touch, movement, and eating

    -   Occasionally caused by multiple sclerosis or a brainstem tumor;
        thus MRI is often obtained

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   In presence of slow transit constipation, use osmotic agents
        > such as sorbitol and lactulose

    -   Docusate stool softeners may help some but generally are limited
        > in efﬁcacy

    -   In refractory cases or with opioid use, stimulant laxatives (eg,
        > senna) may be necessary

    -   In presence of anorectal dysfunction, suppositories often
        necessary

####  Delirium 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Acute-onset confusional state, usually lasting less than 1 week

    -   Fluctuating mental status with marked deﬁcit of short-term
        memory

    -   Inability to concentrate, maintain attention, or sustain
        purposeful behavior

    -   Increased anxiety and irritability or withdrawal

    -   Risk factors include dementia, organic brain lesion, alcohol
        dependence, medications, and various medical problems

    -   Mild to moderate delirium at night ("sundowning") is often
        precipitated by hospitalization, drugs, or sensory deprivation

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Depression or other psychiatric disorder

    -   Alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal

    -   Medication side effect

    -   Subclinical status epilepticus

    -   Pain

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Identify and treat underlying cause

    -   Manage pain; undertreatment or overtreatment of pain may con-
        tribute to delirium

    -   Promote restful sleep; keep patient up and interactive during
        day

#####  13 

-   Frequent reorientation by staff, family, clocks, calendars

-   When medication needed, low-dose haloperidol or atypical
    antipsychotic; avoid benzodiazepines except in alcohol and ben-
    zodiazepine withdrawal

-   Avoid potentially offending medications, particularly anticholin-
    ergic and psychoactive medications

-   Avoid restraints, lines, and tubes

####  Dementia 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Persistent and progressive impairment in intellectual function,
        > including loss of short-term memory, word-ﬁnding difﬁculties,
        > apraxia (inability to perform previously learned tasks),
        > agnosia (inability to recognize objects), and visuospatial
        > problems (becom- ing lost in familiar surroundings)

    -   Impaired function in activities of daily living

    -   Behavioral disturbances or psychiatric symptoms can be common

    -   Alzheimer's disease accounts for more than half of cases; vascu-
        > lar dementia second most common; other causes include Lewy
        > body and frontotemporal dementia

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Normal age-related cognitive changes or drug effects

    -   Depression or other psychiatric disorder

    -   Delirium

        > roidism, or vitamin B~12~ deﬁciency)

    -   Sensory impairment

    -   Parkinson's disease

    -   Rare CNS process such as chronic subdural hematoma, meningioma,
        > metastasis; or neurologic process such as temporal lobe
        > epilepsy

-   ##### Treatment

13

-   Correct sensory deﬁcits, treat underlying disease, remove offend-

> ing medications, and treat depression, when present

-   Caregiver education, referral to Alzheimer's Association, advanced
    > care planning early

-   Consider anticholinesterase inhibitors (eg, donepezil) in
    > Alzheimer's type dementia, vascular dementia, or dementia with
    > Lewy bodies

-   Consider memantine in more advanced Alzheimer's type dementia

-   Treat behavioral problems (eg, agitation) with environmental and
    > behavioral interventions; use medications for targeted symptoms
    > that are disturbing to the patient or endanger the patient or
    > others

-   Advanced dementia can beneﬁt from a palliative approach

####  Falls 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Frequently not mentioned to physicians

    -   Evidence of trauma or fractures, but this may be subtle, espe-
        cially in the hip

    -   Decreased activity, social isolation

    -   Fear of falling

    -   Functional decline

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Visual impairment

    -   Gait impairment due to muscular weakness, podiatric disorder, or
        neurologic dysfunction

    -   Environmental hazards such as poor lighting, stairways, rugs,
        warped ﬂoors

    -   Polypharmacy (especially with use of sedative-hypnotics)

    -   Postural hypotension, particularly postprandial hypotension

    -   Presyncope, vertigo, disequilibrium, and syncope

-   ##### Treatment

####  Hearing Impairment 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Difﬁculty understanding speech, difﬁculty listening to
        > television or talking on the telephone, tinnitus, hearing loss
        > limiting personal or social life

    -   "Whisper test": Patient is unable to repeat numbers whispered

    > activities of daily living

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Sensorineural hearing loss (presbycusis, ototoxicity due to med-
        > ications, tumors or infections of cranial nerve VIII, injury
        > by vas- cular events)

    -   Conductive hearing loss (cerumen impaction, otosclerosis,
        > chronic otitis media, Ménière's disease, trauma, tumors)

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Cerumen removal if impaction present (carbamide peroxide drops,
        > gentle irrigation with warm water)

    -   Consider assistive listening devices (ampliﬁers, ampliﬁed tele-
        > phone, low-frequency doorbells, closed-captioned television

####  Inappropriate Prescribing and Polypharmacy 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Risk factors: Older age, cognitive impairment, taking ﬁve or
        more medications, multiple prescribing physicians, and recent
        discharge from a hospital

    -   A medical regimen that includes unnecessary or inappropriate
        medications, such that the likelihood of adverse effects (from
        the number or type of medications) exceeds the likelihood of
        beneﬁt

    -   Medications used to prevent illness without improving symptoms
        have increasingly marginal risk-beneﬁt proﬁles in patients with
        limited life expectancies

    -   Over-the-counter drugs and supplements often added on by a
        patient without physician's awareness

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Appropriate use of multiple medications to treat older adults
        for multiple comorbid conditions

    -   Underuse of potentially useful medications is also common among
        older patients

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Regularly review all medications, instructions, and indications
        (including prescriptions from other providers)

    -   Involve pharmacists in medication review, especially for medica-

> tion reconciliation during transitions of care

#####  13 

-   Keep dosing regimens as simple as possible

-   Avoid managing an adverse drug reaction with another drug

-   Select medications that can treat more than one problem

-   Consider if beneﬁts of adding a medication justiﬁes the increase in
    complexity of the regimen and risk of side effects

####  Insomnia 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Difﬁculty in initiating or maintaining sleep or nonrestorative
        > sleep lasting at least 1 month and causing impairment of
        > social or occu- pational functioning

    -   For acute insomnia (\< 3 weeks), presence of recent life stress,
        > new symptoms (such as cough, pain, acid reﬂux), or new
        > medications

    -   Related to psychiatric disorder, such as major depression or
        > post- traumatic stress disorder

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Primary sleep disorders (sleep apnea, restless legs)

    -   Psychiatric illness (depression, anxiety, mania, psychoses,
        > stress, panic attacks, posttraumatic stress disorder)

    -   Comorbid disease causing chronic pain, dyspnea, urinary fre-
        > quency, reﬂux esophagitis, or delirium

    -   Drug effect (beta-blockers, bronchodilators, caffeine, corticos-
        > teroids, theophylline, selective serotonin reuptake
        > inhibitors, diuretics, others); withdrawal from
        > sedative-hypnotic medica- tions or alcohol

    -   Noisy environment, excessive daytime napping

    -   Disordered circadian rhythms (jet lag, shift work, dementia)

-   ##### Treatment

13

-   Treat underlying cause of insomnia by removing or modifying mit-

> igating factors

-   Maintain good sleep hygiene (avoid stimulants, minimize noise, keep
    > regular sleep schedule, avoid daytime naps, exercise regularly)

-   Refer for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia

-   Refer for polysomnography if a primary sleep disorder, such as sleep
    > apnea, is suspected

-   Consider short-term (\< 4 weeks) intermittent use of ramelteon
    > (melatonin receptor agonist), zolpidem, or eszopiclone (non-
    > benzodiazepine)

-   Avoid diphenhydramine because of anticholinergic effects

        (partial- thickness skin loss involving the epidermis or
        dermis); stage III (full-thickness skin loss extending to the
        deep fascia); stage IV (full-thickness skin loss involving
        muscle or bone)

    -   Risk factors: Immobility, incontinence, malnutrition, cognitive
        impairment, older age, impaired sensory perception

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Herpes simplex virus ulcers

    -   Venous insufﬁciency ulcers

    -   Underlying osteomyelitis

    -   Ulcerated skin cancer

    -   Pyoderma gangrenosum

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Reduce pressure (reposition patient every 2 hours, use special
        support mattress)

    -   Treat underlying conditions that may prevent wound healing
        (infection, malnutrition, poor functional status, incontinence,
        comorbid illnesses)

    -   Control pain

    -   Select dressing to keep the wound moist and the surrounding

#####  13 

> tissue intact (hydrocolloids, silver sulfadiazine, or, if heavy exu-

-   Debridement if necrotic tissue present (sharp debridement with
    scalpel, enzymatic debridement with collagenase, bio-debride- ment
    with maggot therapy, or autolytic debridement with occlu- sive
    dressings)

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Weight loss exceeding 5% in 1 month or 10% in 6 months

    -   Weight should be measured regularly

    -   The cause of weight loss is usually diagnosed by history and
        > physical examination

    -   Most useful tests for further evaluation: Chest x-ray, complete
        > blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel (including glucose
        > and calcium), thyroid-stimulating hormone, urinalysis, and
        > fecal occult blood testing

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Physiologic changes of aging (reduced smell, taste, and chewing
        > efﬁciency; slower gastric emptying; reduced ability to recover
        > from acute undernutrition)

    -   Medical disorders (congestive heart failure, chronic lung
        > disease, chronic renal failure, peptic ulcers, dementia,
        > dysphagia, malig- nancy, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism,
        > malabsorption, sys- temic infections, hospitalization)

    -   Social problems (poverty, isolation, inability to obtain food,
        > alco- holism, abuse and neglect, dietary restrictions)

    -   Psychiatric disorders (depression, schizophrenia, bereavement,
        > anorexia nervosa, bulimia)

    -   Drug effects (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, NSAIDs,
        > digoxin, antibiotics, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors)

13

-   #####  Treatment

    -   Direct at underlying etiology---usually multifactorial

    -   Frequent meals, protein-calorie supplements, multivitamins,
        > enhancement of food ﬂavor

    -   Family-style dining (rather than eating alone), hand-feeding,
        > and occupational and swallow therapy to modify utensils and
        > teach swallow techniques

    -   Referral to senior centers and meal programs as indicated

    -   Exercise prescription to help restore or preserve muscle

    -   "Watchful waiting" when cause is unknown after basic evaluation
        > (25% of cases)

    -   Consider enteral tube feedings if treatment would improve qual-
        > ity of life and is in line with goals of care

## Dermatologic Disorders

####  Acanthosis Nigricans 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Symmetric velvety hyperpigmented plaques on axillae, groin, and
        neck; the face, umbilicus, inner thighs, anus, ﬂexor surfaces of
        elbows and knees, and mucosal surfaces may also be affected

    -   Usually a cutaneous marker of insulin-resistant state (obesity,
        type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovarian syndrome, metabolic
        syndrome)

    -   Also associated with several less common insulin resistance syn-
        dromes, such as type A (hyperandrogenism) and type B (autoimmune
        disease), and with ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor mutations

    -   Associated with some drugs (testosterone, nicotinic acid, oral
        contraceptives, corticosteroids, protease inhibitors)

    -   Widespread lesions, palmar involvement, or disease occurring in
        a nonobese patient arouse suspicion of malignant acanthosis
        nigri- cans associated with adenocarcinomas of the stomach,
        lung, and breast

    -   Basic work-up may include fasting glucose and insulin, blood
        pres- sure, lipid proﬁle, and androgen levels depending on
        presentation

    -   Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (Gougerot-Carteaud
        syndrome)

    -   Epidermal nevus

    -   Dowling-Degos disease

####  Acne Vulgaris 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Often occurs at puberty, though onset may be delayed until the
        > third or fourth decade

    -   Open and closed comedones the hallmarks

    -   Severity varies from comedone to papular or pustular inﬂamma-
        > tory acne to cysts or nodules

    -   Face, neck, upper chest, and back may be affected

    -   Pigmentary changes and severe scarring can occur

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Acne rosacea, perioral dermatitis, gram-negative folliculitis,
        > tinea faciei, and pseudofolliculitis

    -   Trunk lesions may be confused with staphylococcal folliculitis,
        > miliaria, or eosinophilic folliculitis

    -   May be induced by topical, inhaled, or systemic steroids, oily
        > topical products, and anabolic steroids

    -   Foods neither cause nor exacerbate acne (except possibly cow's
        > milk)

    -   In women with resistant acne, hyperandrogenism should be con-
        > sidered; may be accompanied by hirsutism and irregular menses

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Improvement usually requires 4--6 weeks

    -   Topical treatment options include benzoyl peroxide, retinoids,
        > dapsone, and antibiotics (primarily clindamycin)

    -   Oral antibiotics (tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline) for
        > mod- erate inﬂammatory acne; erythromycin is an alternative
        > when tetracyclines are contraindicated

    -   Low-dose oral contraceptives containing a nonandrogenic prog-

15

estin can be effective in women. Oral spironolactone may be

> added.

-   Diluted intralesional corticosteroids effective in reducing highly
    > inﬂammatory papules and cysts

-   Oral isotretinoin useful in some who fail antibiotic therapy; preg-
    > nancy prevention and monitoring essential

-   Surgical and laser techniques available to treat scarring

    -   Induced by chronic sun exposure

    -   Lesions may become hypertrophic or develop a cutaneous horn

    -   Lower lip actinic keratosis (actinic cheilitis) presents as
        diffuse, slight scaling of the entire lip

    -   Actinic keratoses are precancerous, as some develop into squa-
        mous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Squamous cell carcinoma

    -   Bowen's disease (squamous cell carcinoma in-situ)

    -   Seborrheic keratosis

    -   Discoid lupus erythematosus

    -   Pemphigus foliaceus

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Cryotherapy when limited number of lesions present

    -   Topical ﬂuorouracil or imiquimod effective for extensive
        disease; usually causes a severe inﬂammatory reaction;
        photodynamic therapy emerging as an additional treatment option

    -   Laser therapy for severe actinic cheilitis

    -   Keep a low threshold for biopsy of atypical lesions or those
        that do not respond to therapy

    -   Sun protection, sunscreen use

        > vesicles in poison oak or ivy)

    -   History of previous reaction to suspected contactant, though
        > patients may be exposed to allergens for years before
        > developing hypersensitivity

    -   Consider patch testing for chronic or recurrent disease

    -   Common allergens include nickel, plants, neomycin, bacitracin,
        > topical anesthetics, fragrances, preservatives, hair dyes,
        > textile dyes, nail care products, adhesives, gold, cobalt,

####  Alopecia Areata 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Usually occurs without associated disease, but patients with
        alope- cia areata have an increased incidence of atopic
        dermatitis, Down's syndrome, lichen planus, vitiligo, autoimmune
        thyroiditis, and systemic lupus erythematosus

    -   Rapid and complete hair loss in one or several round or oval
        patches

    -   Occurs on the scalp or in the beard, eyebrows, or eyelashes;
        other hair-bearing areas less frequently affected

    -   Short broken hairs on patch periphery

    -   During active disease, telogen hairs near the patches easily
        pulled

    -   The patches show preservation of follicles and normal scalp

    -   Some patients have nail pitting

    -   Some progress to total loss of scalp hair (alopecia totalis); a
        few lose all body hair (alopecia universalis)

    -   Biopsy with horizontal sectioning if diagnosis unclear

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Course is variable: Some patches regrow spontaneously, others

#####  15 

> resist therapy

-   Intralesional steroid injections (monthly) are primary treatment

-   Topical anthralin, corticosteroids, or minoxidil, contact sensiti-
    zation with squaric acid, and psoralen plus UVA

-   Psychologic stress can be devastating; emotional support and patient
    education essential

    -   Several variants (nodular, superﬁcial, micronodular,
        > inﬁltrative, sclerosing, pigmented, etc.)

    -   Immunosuppressive medications increase frequency and aggres-
        > siveness; patients with albinism or xeroderma pigmentosum or

####  Discoid (Chronic Cutaneous) Lupus Erythematosus 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Dull red macules or papules developing into sharply demarcated
        > hyperkeratotic plaques with follicular plugs

    -   Lesions heal from the center with atrophy, dyspigmentation, and
        > telangiectasias

    -   Localized lesions most common on scalp, nose, cheeks, ears,
        > lower lip, and neck

    -   Scalp lesions cause scarring alopecia

    -   Generalized disease involves trunk and upper extremities

    -   Abnormal serologies, leukopenia, and albuminuria identify DLE

####  Erysipelas and Cellulitis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Cellulitis: An acute infection of the subcutaneous tissue, most
        frequently caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes* or *Staphylococcus
        aureus*

    -   Erythema, edema, tenderness are the hallmarks of cellulitis;
        vesi- cles, exudation, purpura, necrosis may follow

    -   Lymphangitic streaking may be seen

    -   Demarcation from uninvolved skin indistinct

    -   Erysipelas: Involves superﬁcial dermal lymphatics

    -   Erysipelas characterized by a warm, red, tender, edematous
        plaque with a sharply demarcated, raised, indurated border;
        classically occurs on the face

    -   Both erysipelas and cellulitis require a portal of entry

    -   Recurrence seen in lymphatic damage or venous insufﬁciency

    -   A prodrome of malaise, fever, and chills may accompany either

    -   Atypical presentations or failure to respond to therapy require
        expansion of differential diagnosis and possibly laboratory
        tests (blood count, liver function, blood cultures, skin
        biopsies, tissue cultures, or imaging)

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Early necrotizing fasciitis or clostridial gangrene

    -   Underlying osteomyelitis

    -   Deep fungal or mycobacterial infections, especially in the
        immunocompromised

    -   Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet's syndrome)

    -   Erythema migrans

    -   Erythema nodosum

    -   Venous thrombosis

####  Erythema Multiforme Minor 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Most often associated with herpes simplex infection (orolabial
        > more than genital)

    -   Episodes follow orolabial herpes by 1--3 weeks and may recur
        > with succeeding outbreaks

    -   Early sharply demarcated erythematous papules that become
        > edematous

    -   Later "target" lesions with three zones: Central duskiness that
        > may vesiculate; edematous, pale ring; and surrounding erythema

    -   Dorsal hands, dorsal feet, palms, soles, and extensor surfaces
        > most frequently affected, with few to hundreds of lesions

    -   Mucosal involvement (usually oral) in 25%

    -   Biopsies often diagnostic, but usually not required

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Stevens-Johnson in evolution

    -   Pemphigus vulgaris

    -   Bullous pemphigoid

    -   Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet's syndrome)

    -   Subacute cutaneous lupus

    -   Granuloma annulare

    -   Fixed drug eruption

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Chronic suppressive antiherpetic therapy prevents 90% of recur-
        > rences (episodic treatment begun after symptoms appear is
        > inef- fective)

15

-   Facial and lip sunscreens may also decrease recurrences by lim-

> iting herpes outbreaks

-   Episodes usually self-limited (resolving in 1--4 weeks) and do not
    > require therapy

-   Systemic corticosteroids discouraged

        bromides), sarcoidosis, and inﬂammatory bowel disease

    -   Symmetric, erythematous, tender plaques or nodules 1--10 cm in
        > diameter on anterior shins

    -   Lesions also occasionally seen on upper legs, neck, and arms

    -   Onset may be accompanied by malaise, leg edema, and arthralgias

    -   Lesions ﬂatten over a few days, leaving a violaceous patch, then
        > heal without atrophy or scarring

    -   All lesions generally resolve within 6 weeks, but recurrences
        > are common

    -   Chronic form with prolonged course not associated with under-
        > lying diseases

    -   Deep skin biopsy for diagnosis

        causative medication

    -   From one to six lesions

    -   Oral, genital, facial, and acral lesions most common

    -   Lesions begin as erythematous, edematous, round, sharply demar-
        cated patches or plaques

    -   May evolve to become targetoid, bullous, or erosive

    -   Postinﬂammatory hyperpigmentation common

    -   Offending agents: NSAIDs, sulfonamides, barbiturates, tetracy-
        clines, erythromycin, metronidazole, antifungals,

        phenolphthalein

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Bullous pemphigoid

    -   Erythema multiforme

    -   Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis)

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Folliculitis: Thin-walled pustules at follicular oriﬁces,
        > particularly extremities, scalp, face, and buttocks; develop
        > in crops and heal in a few days

    -   Furuncle: Acute, round, tender, circumscribed, perifollicular
        > abscess; most undergo central necrosis and rupture with
        > purulent discharge

####  Genital Warts (Condylomata Acuminata) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Gray, yellow, or pink exophytic papules or broad-based conﬂuent
        plaques

    -   Occur on the penis, vulva, cervix, perineum, crural folds, or
        peri- anal area; also may be intraurethral or intra-anal

    -   Caused by human papillomavirus; sexually transmitted

    -   Increased risk of progression to cervical cancer, anal cancer,
        or bowenoid papulosis in certain HPV subtypes (primarily 16, 18,
        and 31)

    -   Children with genital warts should be evaluated for sexual
        abuse, but childhood infection can also be acquired via
        perinatal verti- cal transmission or digital autoinoculation

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Molluscum contagiosum

    -   Bowenoid papulosis and squamous cell carcinoma

    -   Seborrheic keratosis

        transmission or prevent progression to cancer

    -   Cryotherapy, topical podophyllum resin, topical trichloroacetic
        acid, electrofulguration, and carbon dioxide laser; plume gener-
        ated by lasers or electrofulguration is potentially infectious
        to health care personnel

    -   Topical imiquimod; women have a higher response rate than men

#####  15 

-   Emphasis on pap smear for women with genital warts and female sexual
    partners of men with genital warts

        iegation, and Diameter over 6 mm

    -   Clinical characteristics vary depending on subtype and location

    -   Early detection is critical; advanced-stage disease has high
        mortality

    -   Epiluminescence microscopy can help identify high-risk lesions

    -   Biopsies for diagnosis must be deep enough to permit measure-
        ment of thickness; partial biopsies should be avoided

        tures (microstaging)

    -   Appropriate staging work-up including history and physical;

> consider laboratory tests, radiologic studies, and sentinel lymph

#####  15 

> node biopsy to evaluate for metastatic spread (not indicated for stage
> 0 or IA)

-   Reexcision with appropriate margins determined by histologic
    characteristics of the tumor

        > later become conﬂuent

    -   Eruption symmetric, beginning on trunk and then generalizing

    -   Often occurs within ﬁrst 2 weeks of drug treatment; may appear
        > later

    -   Pruritus usually prominent

    -   Ampicillin, amoxicillin, allopurinol, sulfonamides,
        > cephalosporins most common causes

####  Nevi (Congenital Nevi, Acquired Nevi) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Common acquired nevi have homogeneous surfaces and color
        patterns, smooth and sharp borders, and are round or oval in
        shape

    -   Color may vary from ﬂesh-colored to brown

    -   Flat or raised depending on the subtype or stage of evolution

    -   Excisional biopsy to rule out melanoma in changing nevi or those
        with suspicious features (see Malignant Melanoma)

    -   Congenital nevi darkly pigmented, sometimes hairy papules or
        plaques that may be present at birth

    -   Large congenital nevi (those whose longest diameter will be
        greater than 20 cm in adulthood) are at increased risk for
        melanoma; when found on head, neck, or posterior midline, asso-
        ciated with underlying leptomeningeal melanocytosis

####  Onychomycosis (Tinea Unguium) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Yellowish discoloration, piling up of subungual keratin,
        friability, and separation of the nail plate

    -   May show only overlying white scale if superﬁcial

    -   Nail shavings for immediate microscopic examination, culture, or
        histologic examination with periodic acid-Schiff stain to

        approved but has low efﬁcacy

    -   Oral terbinaﬁne and itraconazole are effective, though
        re-infection is common

    -   Weekly prophylactic topical antifungals to suppress tinea pedis
        may limit recurrences after oral treatment

    -   Adequate informed consent critical; patients must decide if ben-
        eﬁts of oral therapy outweigh risks (including liver failure)

        > predilection for certain body parts

    -   Dermatitis caused by inﬂammatory response to louse saliva

    -   Pediculosis capitis (head lice): Intense scalp pruritus,
        > presence of nits, possible secondary impetigo and cervical
        > lymphadenopa- thy; most common in children, rare in blacks

    -   Pediculosis corporis (body lice): Rarely found on skin, causes
        > generalized pruritus, erythematous macules or urticarial
        > wheals, excoriations, and licheniﬁcation; homeless persons and
        > those living in crowded conditions most frequently affected

    -   Pediculosis pubis (crabs): Usually sexually transmitted;
        > generally limited to pubic area, axillae, and eyelashes; lice
        > may be observed on skin and nits on hairs; maculae ceruleae
        > (blue macules) may be seen

    -   Body lice can transmit trench fever, relapsing fever, and
        > epidemic typhus

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Head lice: Impetigo, hair casts, seborrheic dermatitis

    -   Body lice: Scabies, urticaria, impetigo, dermatitis
        > herpetiformis

    -   Pubic lice: Scabies, anogenital pruritus, eczema

    -   Treat household contacts

15

-   Body lice: Launder all clothing and bedding (at least 30 minutes

> at 150°F in dryer, or iron pressing of wool garments); patient should
> then bathe; no pesticides required

####  Pemphigus Vulgaris 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Typically presents in ﬁfth or sixth decade

    -   Caused by autoantibodies to desmogleins; occasionally drug-
        induced (penicillamine, captopril)

    -   Thin-walled, fragile blisters; rupture to form painful erosions
        that crust and heal slowly without scarring

    -   Often initially presents with oral involvement

    -   Scalp, face, neck, axillae, and groin common sites; esophagus,
        tra- chea, conjunctiva, and other mucosal surfaces may also be
        involved

    -   Lateral pressure applied to perilesional skin induces more blis-
        tering (Nikolsky's sign)

    -   Diagnosis by lesional biopsy of intact blisters, perilesional
        direct immunoﬂuorescence, indirect immunoﬂuorescence

        necrolysis

    -   Linear IgA dermatosis

    -   Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita

    -   Patients presenting with only oral lesions may be misdiagnosed
        with aphthous stomatitis, erythema multiforme, herpes simplex,
        lichen planus, or cicatricial pemphigoid

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Viscous lidocaine and antibiotic rinses for oral erosions

#####  15 

-   Early and aggressive systemic therapy required; mortality high in
    untreated patients

-   High doses of oral prednisone combined with another immuno-
    suppressive (azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil)

-   Monitor for side effects and infections

-   Plasmapheresis, intravenous immune globulin, rituximab, and tumor
    necrosis factor alpha inhibitors are alternatives

        > common causes

    -   Pseudoporphyria with blistering caused by naproxen, tetracy-
        > clines, furosemide, dapsone, contraceptives, and other
        > medications

    -   Photodistributed lichenoid reactions most frequently due to thi-

####  Pityriasis Rosea 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Oval, salmon-colored, symmetric papules with long axis follow-
        ing cleavage lines

    -   Lesions show "collarette of scale" at periphery

    -   Trunk most frequently involved; sun-exposed areas often spared

    -   A "herald" patch precedes eruption by 1--2 weeks; some patients
        report prodrome of constitutional symptoms

    -   Typically lasts 6--10 weeks

    -   Pruritus common but usually mild

    -   Most common between ages of 10 and 35 years

    -   Variations in mode of onset, morphology, distribution, and
        course are common. Atypical forms include inverse distribution,
        mucosal, urticarial, vesicular, pustular, and purpuric variants

    -   Attempts to isolate infective agent have been disappointing

        disorders, and arthritis; also seen with hepatitis B or C, HIV
        infec- tion, lupus, pregnancy, PAPA syndrome, and others

    -   Up to half of cases idiopathic

    -   Diagnosis of exclusion; biopsies with special stains and
        cultures to rule out infections (bacterial, mycobacterial,
        fungal, tertiary syphilis, amebiasis)

    -   Local compresses, occlusive dressings, potent topical steroids,

#####  15 

> intralesional steroids, or topical tacrolimus

-   High-dose systemic steroids in widespread disease; if control is not
    established or if a steroid taper is unsuccessful, a steroid-sparing
    agent (cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, inﬂiximab, etc.) is
    added

-   Dapsone, sulfasalazine, and clofazimine also steroid-sparing

        with some spillover into neighboring dermatomes

    -   Prodrome of pain and paresthesias followed by papules and
        plaques of erythema that quickly develop vesicles

    -   Vesicles become pustular, crust over, and heal

    -   May disseminate (≥ 20 lesions outside the primary dermatome) in
        the elderly, debilitated, or immunosuppressed; visceral involve-
        ment (lungs, liver, or brain) may follow

    -   Involvement of the nasal tip (Hutchinson's sign) a harbinger of
        ophthalmic zoster

    -   Zoster 30 times more common in the HIV-infected; ascertain HIV
        risk factors

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Oral acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir

    -   Intravenous acyclovir for disseminated or ocular zoster

    -   Bed rest to reduce risk of neuralgia in the elderly

    -   Prednisone does not prevent neuralgia

#####  15 

-   Topical capsaicin, local anesthetics, nerve blocks, analgesics, tri-
    cyclic antidepressants, or gabapentin for postherpetic neuralgia

## Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Breast Disorders

####  Abnormal Uterine Bleeding 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Excessive menses, intermenstrual bleeding, or both; post-
        > menopausal bleeding

    -   Common soon after menarche, 4--6 years premenopause

    -   Papanicolaou smear (all ages) and endometrial biopsy (all post-
        > menopausal women and those over age 35 with chronic anovula-
        > tion or more than 6 months of bleeding)

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Pregnancy (especially ectopic), spontaneous abortion

    -   Anovulation (eg, polycystic ovaries, hypothyroidism,
        perimenopause)

    -   Uterine myoma or carcinoma, adenomyosis, polyp

    -   Cervicitis, carcinoma of the cervix, trauma

    -   Exogenous hormones (eg, unopposed estrogen, progestin only
        > contraceptives), or Copper T IUD

    -   Coagulation disorders (eg, von Willebrand's disease)

-   ##### Treatment

        > menopausal women and those over age 35 with chronic anovula-
        > tion or more than 6 months of bleeding)

    -   Active bleeding with signiﬁcant anemia: High-dose estrogen (25
        > mg intravenously or oral contraceptive taper: two pills twice
        > daily for 3 days tapering over 2 weeks to one daily);
        > high-dose progestin when high-dose estrogen contraindicated

    -   Chronic bleeding: NSAIDs (any type, around the clock for 5 days)
        > plus oral contraceptives, levonorgestrel intrauterine system,
        > or cyclic progestin

    -   Hysterectomy, uterine artery embolization, or endometrial
        > ablation for bleeding refractory to hormonal therapy

####  Amenorrhea 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Absence of menses for more than three cycles in women with past
        menses (secondary); absence of menarche by age 16 years
        (primary)

    -   May be anatomic, ovarian, or hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian

    -   Anatomic causes: Congenital anomalies of the uterus, imperforate
        hymen, cervical stenosis, Asherman's syndrome.

    -   Ovarian failure: Autoimmune diseases, Turner's syndrome, ovarian
        dysgenesis, premature ovarian failure, radiation, chemotherapy

    -   Hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian: hyperandrogenic disorders,
        anorexia, hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism, hypothalamic or
        pituitary lesions

    -   Exclude pregnancy; measure thyroid-stimulating hormone,
        prolactin

    -   Withdrawal bleed: Give 10 mg of medroxy-progesterone acetate for
        10 days. Bleeding indicates ovaries are producing estrogen,
        uterus and outﬂow tract are intact. No bleeding suggests
        hypothal- amic-pituitary causes, premature ovarian failure,
        Asherman's syn- drome

####  Cervical Dysplasia 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Caused by HPV infection; risk factors: Early intercourse, multi-
        > ple partners, smoking, HIV

    -   Includes low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions
        > (LSIL, HSIL) or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1--3)

    -   Seventy-ﬁve percent of low-grade (CIN 1) lesions regress spon-
        > taneously; only 35% of high-grade (CIN 2--3) regress

    -   Atypical squamous cells of undetermined signiﬁcance (ASCUS, ASC)

        > noma, or high-grade dysplasia in 40%

    -   Colposcopy conﬁrms and excludes invasive cancer

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Inﬂammation due to vaginitis, cervicitis, or atrophy

    -   Inaccurate interpretation of cytology or histology

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Advise smoking cessation

    -   ASCUS: Three options acceptable: repeat Pap at 6 and 12 months
        > with colposcopy for any repeat abnormality; HPV test in women

> \> 20 years and if positive perform colposcopy (repeat Pap 1 year if

-   Low-grade lesions: Colposcopy with biopsy conﬁrms diagnosis;
    > expectant management versus ablation or excision; for women

> \< 20 years, repeat Pap 1 year

-   High-grade lesions including ASCUS favor high grade (ASC-H):
    > Colposcopy with biopsy to conﬁrm diagnosis; treat with ablation or
    > excision

-   Atypical glandular cells: Colposcopy, endocervical curettage, and

####  Chronic Pelvic Pain 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Subacute pelvic pain of more than 6 months duration

    -   Etiology often multifactorial

    -   Up to 40% have been physically or sexually abused

    -   Up to 30% with pelvic inﬂammatory disease (PID) go on to have
        chronic pelvic pain

    -   Pain that resolves with ovulation suppression suggests
        gynecologic cause

    -   Concomitant depression very common

    -   Ultrasound and physical exam often not diagnostic

    -   Half of women who undergo laparoscopy for chronic pelvic pain
        have no visible pathology

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Gynecologic: Endometriosis, adenomyosis, pelvic adhesions,
        chronic PID or endometritis, mittelschmerz; leiomyomas can cause
        pelvic heaviness but rarely cause pain.

    -   Gastrointestinal: Irritable bowel syndrome, inﬂammatory bowel
        disease, diverticular disease, constipation, neoplasia, hernia

    -   Urologic: Detrusor overactivity, interstitial cystitis, urinary
        calculi, urethral syndrome, bladder carcinoma

    -   Musculoskeletal: Myofascial pain, low back pain, disk problems,
        nerve entrapment, muscle strain or spasm

    -   Psychiatric: Somatization, depression, abuse, anxiety

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Evaluate for and treat the above causes, especially psychiatric

    -   NSAIDs; avoid opioids

    -   Ovulation suppression with oral contraceptives, depomedroxy-
        progesterone acetate, levonorgestrel IUS, or a short course of
        leupro- lide acetate can be both diagnostic and therapeutic.

    -   Pelvic ﬂoor physical therapy or biofeedback for pelvic ﬂoor

#####  16 

> muscle spasm

-   Diagnostic laparoscopy if gynecologic cause is suspected, med- ical
    management fails, or diagnosis remains in question

-   Hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy for refractory gyne-
    cologic pain in women who have completed childbearing

####  Dysmenorrhea 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Occurs in 50% of menstruating women

    -   Low, midline, cramping pelvic pain radiating to back or legs;
        > pain starting before or with menses, peaking after 24 hours,
        > and sub- siding after 2 days; often associated with nausea,
        > diarrhea, headache, and ﬂushing

    -   Primary dysmenorrhea: Pain without pelvic pathology and begin-
        > ning within 1--2 years after menarche

    -   Secondary dysmenorrhea: Pain with underlying pathology such as
        > endometriosis or adenomyosis, developing years after menarche

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Endometriosis

    -   Adenomyosis

    -   Uterine myoma

    -   Cervical stenosis, uterine anomalies

    -   Chronic endometritis or pelvic inﬂammatory disease

    -   Copper T intrauterine device

-   ##### Treatment

    -   NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors before the onset of bleeding, con-
        > tinued for 2--3 days taken around the clock.

    -   Suppression of ovulation with oral contraceptives, depomedroxy-
        > progesterone acetate, or levonorgestrel intrauterine system

    -   In secondary dysmenorrhea, laparoscopy may be indicated to
        > diagnose endometriosis

####  Ectopic Pregnancy 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Pregnancy implantation outside uterine cavity

    -   Most commonly presents 6--8 weeks after last menstrual period

    -   Classic triad: Pregnant, bleeding or spotting, pelvic pain.

    -   Rupture causes sudden increase in pain, dizziness, and anemia
        leading to shock and cardiovascular collapse

    -   Transvaginal ultrasound to identify intrauterine gestation when
        beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) is above approxi-
        mately 2000 mU/mL; an empty uterine cavity when β-hCG \> 2000 is
        highly suspicious; transvaginal ultrasound often cannot
        demonstrate an extrauterine pregnancy

    -   Diagnosis conﬁrmed by lack of placental villi after suction
        curet- tage or by laparoscopy

    -   In patients with a desired pregnancy who are hemodynamically
        stable, serum β-hCG can be obtained every 48 hours and should
        approximately double; failure to double indicates either ectopic
        or abnormal intrauterine gestation

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Intrauterine pregnancy (threatened abortion, early pregnancy
        failure, gestational trophoblastic neoplasia)

    -   Ruptured corpus luteum cyst

    -   Other GI, GU and gynecologic causes of acute abdomino-pelvic
        pain

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Suction curettage to conﬁrm diagnosis

    -   Surgical removal of the Fallopian tube is deﬁnitive and is
        recom- mended for larger or complicated ectopic pregnancies and
        in those who do not desire future fertility

    -   Methotrexate can be offered as an alternative for patients with

#####  16 

> small, unruptured ectopic pregnancies who can be compliant with
> multiple follow-up visits and laboratory work; 6% have tubal rup- ture
> after methotrexate.

-   Emergent surgery if hemodynamically unstable

-   Rh~o~ immune globulin to Rh-negative patients

-   Effective contraception to prevent future ectopic pregnancy

####  Endometriosis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Seen in 10% of all menstruating women, 25% of infertile women

    -   Progressive, recurrent, characterized by aberrant growth of
        > endometrium outside the uterus

    -   Classic triad: Cyclic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia

    -   May be associated with infertility or pelvic mass (endometrioma)

    -   Pelvic examination may or may not be normal. Abnormalities can
        > include a ﬁxed retroverted uterus, tender or nodular
        > uterosacral ligaments, or an adnexal mass.

    -   Hematochezia, painful defecation, or hematuria if bowel or blad-
        > der invaded

    -   Ultrasound often normal but useful for diagnosis of
        > endometrioma.

    -   Laparoscopy with biopsy of endometriotic lesions confirms
        > diagnosis

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Other causes of chronic pelvic pain

    -   Primary dysmenorrhea

    -   Adenomyosis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   NSAIDs

    -   Ovulation suppression with continuous oral contraceptives until
        > fertility is desired; levonorgestrel IUS also effective;
        > depomedroxy- progesterone acetate also effective but
        > associated with 9-month delay in return to fertility

    -   If OCPs ineffective, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
        > analogs (eg, leuprolide) with add-back estrogen can be used
        > for up to 6 months followed by continuous OCPs

    -   Laparoscopy with ablation of lesions for refractory pain is tem-

16

porarily helpful in up to two-thirds of patients; 50% recur.

> Laparoscopic ablation of lesions also results in temporary improvement
> in fertility rates.

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Common age 20--50 years

    -   Presents with cyclic breast pain with maximal pain during the
        premenstrual phase and resolution during menses.

    -   On exam, tender, often multiple, usually bilateral masses in the
        breasts; excessive nodularity, generalized lumpiness.

    -   Rapid ﬂuctuation in size of masses

    -   Rare in postmenopausal women not on hormonal therapy

    -   Eighty percent of women have histologic ﬁbrocystic changes

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Breast carcinoma

    -   Fibroadenoma

    -   Fat necrosis

    -   Intraductal papilloma

-   ##### Treatment

    -   A diagnostic work-up of any discrete mass or asymmetric area is
        necessary

    -   Biopsy (ﬁne-needle aspiration or core-needle biopsy) to exclude
        carcinoma and determine whether cystic or solid

    -   In women younger than 35 years, ultrasound can be used instead
        of biopsy to differentiate cystic from solid masses

    -   Mammography in women older than 40 years

    -   Frequent follow-up of all women with breast masses even if work-
        up is negative given possibility of false-negative testing.

    -   For breast thickening or ill-deﬁned masses, follow-up breast
        exam in different stage of menstrual cycle

    -   For mastalgia: Supportive brassiere (night and day), NSAIDs,
        oral

> contraceptives; for severe pain, danazol (100--200 mg bid),

#####  16

####  Menopausal Syndrome 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Cessation of menses without other cause, usually due to aging or
        > bilateral oophorectomy

    -   Average age is 51 years; earlier in women who smoke

    -   Perimenopause: Declining ovarian function over 4--6 years

    -   Menstrual irregularity, hot ﬂushes, night sweats, mood
        > ﬂuctuation, sleep disturbance, vaginal dryness

    -   Elevated serum FSH and LH

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Other causes of amenorrhea, especially pregnancy

    -   Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism

    -   Pheochromocytoma

    -   Uterine neoplasm

    -   Sjögren's syndrome

    -   Depression

    -   Anorexia

-   ##### Treatment

    -   The most effective treatment for hot ﬂashes and other menopausal
        > symptoms is oral estrogen therapy. However, estrogen therapy
        > has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer in
        > random- ized controlled trials and so should be reserved for
        > those with severe symptoms and after a thorough discussion.
        > Other therapies such as megestrol acetate, clonidine,
        > selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and
        > gabapentin are modestly effective.

    -   Hot ﬂashes often resolve by 2--4 years after menopause

    -   For irregular bleeding in the perimenopause, oral
        > contraceptives, levonorgestrel intrauterine system, cyclic or
        > combined continuous estrogen plus progestin, or progestins
        > alone

16

-   Estrogen cream and nonhormonal lubricants for vaginal dryness

    -   Although long-term use of combined hormonal therapy decreases
        > osteoporosis and colon cancer, it increases the risk of breast
        > cancer and thromboembolism

####  Mucopurulent Cervicitis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   A sexually transmitted infection most commonly caused by

> *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* or *Chlamydia*

-   Cervical inﬂammation can also result from herpesvirus, or vagini-
    tis due to *Trichomonas* or *Candida*

-   Usually asymptomatic but may have abnormal vaginal discharge, or
    postcoital bleeding

-   Red, friable cervix with purulent, often blood-streaked endocer-
    vical discharge

-   Must be distinguished from physiologic ectopy of columnar epithelium
    common in young women

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Pelvic inﬂammatory disease

    -   Cervical carcinoma or dysplasia

    -   Cervical ulcer secondary to syphilis, chancroid, or granuloma
        inguinale

    -   Normal epithelial ectopy

    -   Cervical inﬂammation due to vaginitis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   In general, treat only if tests are positive for *N.
        gonorrhoeae* or

> *Chlamydia;* empirically in a high-risk or noncompliant patient

-   Gonorrhea: Ceftriaxone 125 mg IM or ceﬁxime 400 mg PO, single dose

-   Chlamydia: Azithromycin 1 g PO single dose or doxycycline 100 mg bid
    for 7 days (once pregnancy excluded)

-   Sexual abstinence until treatment completed; provide or refer
    partner for therapy

    -   Ovarian or adnexal mass

    -   Abnormal uterine bleeding due to other causes

    -   Leiomyosarcoma

    -   Other abdominal/pelvic mass

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Exclude pregnancy

    -   Papanicolaou smear and endometrial biopsy (if \> 35 years and
        > irregular bleeding)

    -   NSAIDs to reduce blood loss; hormonal therapy to reduce
        > endometrial volume (oral contraceptives, depomedroxyproges-

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Most common in young, sexually active women with multiple
        partners or a new sexual partner

    -   Upper genital tract infection associated with *Neisseria gonor-
        rhoeae* and *Chlamydia trachomatis,* anaerobes, *Haemophilus
        inﬂuenzae,* enteric gram-negative rods, and streptococci

    -   Difﬁcult to diagnose because severity varies from asymptomatic
        to toxic

    -   Sequelae: Chronic pelvic pain, infertility, pelvic adhesions

    -   Delay in diagnosis and treatment probably contributes to
        sequelae. Maintain a low threshold for diagnosis.

    -   Minimum diagnostic criteria per CDC: pelvic/abdominal pain AND
        one of the following: Cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal
        tenderness AND absence of competing diagnosis

    -   Diagnostic speciﬁcity improved by presence of fever, cervical
        mucopus, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate

    -   Pelvic ultrasound may reveal a tubo-ovarian abscess

    -   Laparoscopy for cases with uncertain diagnosis or no improve-
        ment despite antibiotic therapy

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Any cause of acute abdominal-pelvic pain or peritonitis (eg.
        appendicitis, diverticulitis, acute cystitis, urinary calculi)

    -   Ruptured ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Oral antibiotics for mild cases (14-day course) covering *N.
        gon- orrhoeae* and *Chlamydia* (ceftriaxone 250 mg IM plus
        doxycy- cline 100 mg bid for 14 days)

    -   Hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics for toxic,
        adolescent,

#####  16 

> HIV-infected, or pregnant patients

-   Surgical or percutaneous drainage of tubo-ovarian abscess

-   Screen for HIV, hepatitis, syphilis

-   Sexual abstinence until treatment completed; partner should be

####  Pelvic Organ Prolapse 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Common in older multiparous women as a delayed result of child-
        > birth injury to pelvic ﬂoor

    -   Includes prolapse of the uterus, bladder (cystocele), rectum
        > (rec- tocele), small bowel (enterocele), or vaginal cuff

    -   Often asymptomatic; may have pelvic pressure or pulling, vagi-
        > nal bulge, low back pain; difﬁculties with sexual function,
        > defe- cation, or voiding

    -   Pelvic examination conﬁrms the diagnosis. Ask the patient to
        > perform Valsalva's to see the severity of the prolapse.

    -   Prolapse may be slight, moderate, or marked

    -   Attenuation of pelvic structures with aging can accelerate
        > development

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Vaginal or cervical neoplasm

    -   Rectal prolapse

    -   Rectal carcinoma

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Supportive measures (eg, Kegel exercises), limit straining and
        > lifting

    -   Treat predisposing factors such as obesity, obstructive airway
        > dis- ease, constipation, and pelvic masses

    -   Conjugated estrogen creams to decrease vaginal irritation

    -   Pessaries may reduce prolapse and its symptoms; ineffective for
        > very large prolapse

####  Pre-eclampsia--Eclampsia 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Progressive, multisystem condition affecting 5--10% of pregnant
        women

    -   Pre-eclampsia is hypertension plus proteinuria after 20 weeks of
        gestation; addition of seizures means eclampsia

    -   Mild pre-eclampsia deﬁned as blood pressure \> 140/90,
        proteinuria

> \> 300 mg/24 hours, and absence of criteria for severe shown below.

-   Severe pre-eclampsia deﬁned as blood pressure \> 160/110 or pro-
    teinuria \> 5 g/24 hours or hematologic, neurologic, cardiopul-
    monary, hepatorenal, or fetal complications listed below.

-   Neurologic: Headache, blurred vision or scotomas, altered mental
    status, seizure

-   Fetal: Intrauterine growth restriction, oligohydramnios

-   Hematologic: Thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, disseminated intravas-
    cular coagulopathy

-   Cardiopulmonary: Pulmonary edema

-   Hepato/renal: Oliguria, anuria, elevated serum creatinine, elevated
    AST or ALT, right upper quadrant tenderness

-   HELLP syndrome: Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets

-   Risk factors: ﬁrst pregnancy, older age, twins, prior preeclampsia,
    hypertension, diabetes, renal or autoimmune disease

```{=html}

    -   Hemolytic-uremic syndrome

    -   Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura

-   ##### Treatment

    -   The only treatment is delivery of the fetus

#####  16 

-   Prior to term, severe cases should have labor induced; mild cases
    can be observed in the hospital with induction of labor for wors-
    ening disease. At term, mild cases should have labor induced

-   Antihypertensives if blood pressure \> 180/110 mm Hg

-   Magnesium sulfate can be given to women to prevent development of
    seizures and to prevent recurrent seizures in those with eclampsia.

####  Puerperal Mastitis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Occurs in nursing mothers within 3 months after delivery

    -   Unilateral inﬂammation and redness of breast or one quadrant of
        > breast with tenderness, induration, warmth, fever, malaise

    -   Sore or ﬁssured nipple may be present

    -   Increased incidence in ﬁrst-time mothers

    -   *Staphylococcus aureus* and streptococci are usual causative
        > agents; community-acquired MRSA increasingly common

    -   May progress to breast abscess

    -   Ultrasound can conﬁrm abscess diagnosis

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Local irritation or trauma

    -   Nondraining duct

    -   Benign or malignant tumors (inﬂammatory carcinoma)

    -   Subareolar abscess (occurs in nonlactating women)

    -   Fat necrosis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   For very mild cases, warm compresses and increased frequency of
        > breastfeeding

    -   Oral dicloxacillin or ﬁrst-generation cephalosporin

    -   If suspect community-acquired MRSA, culture milk and use Septra
        > or clindamycin

    -   Hospitalize for intravenous antibiotics if no improvement in 48
        > hours or in toxic patients

    -   Increase frequency of breastfeeding

    -   Incision and drainage for abscess; stop breastfeeding from
        > affected breast (may pump milk and discard)

####  Spontaneous Abortion 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and cramping before the 20th week
        of pregnancy occurring in up to 20% of pregnancies

    -   Threatened abortion: Pregnancy may continue or abortion may
        ensue; cervix closed, bleeding and cramping mild, intrauterine
        pregnancy conﬁrmed

    -   Inevitable or incomplete abortion: Cervix dilated and products
        of conception may or may not be partially expelled; brisk
        bleeding

    -   Completed abortion: Products of conception completely expelled;
        cervix closed, cramping and bleeding decreased

    -   Early pregnancy failure (embryonic demise, missed abortion):
        Failed pregnancy detected by ultrasound; cervix closed, absent
        or minimal bleeding and cramping

    -   Serum β-hCG fails to rise appropriately (except in threatened
        abortion)

    -   Pelvic ultrasonography contraindicated when bleeding heavy or
        cervix open because it delays treatment

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Ectopic pregnancy

    -   Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia

    -   Cervical neoplasm or lesion, trauma

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Follow hematocrit and bleeding quantity closely as women with
        spontaneous abortion can have rapid blood loss

    -   Conﬁrm intrauterine pregnancy with ultrasound; if unable to
        conﬁrm intrauterine location, follow closely until ectopic
        pregnancy is ruled out

    -   Threatened abortion: β-hCG in 2--3 days; immediate follow-up if
        brisk bleeding develops. Limiting activity is ineffective.

    -   Inevitable or incomplete abortion: Suction curettage to immedi-

-   Missed abortion: Suction curettage, methotrexate, or wait for
    spontaneous abortion

-   Rh~o~ immune globulin to Rh-negative mothers

-   Follow-up to ensure patient is no longer pregnant

####  Urinary Incontinence 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Uncontrolled loss of urine; classiﬁed as stress, urge, mixed, or
        > overﬂow

    -   Stress incontinence: Urine loss during coughing or exercising;
        > leakage observed on examination during cough or with
        > Valsalva's maneuver

    -   Urge incontinence due to spontaneous bladder contractions;
        > accompanied by urgency, associated with frequency and
        > nocturia, normal examination

    -   Overﬂow incontinence is very unusual in women and is caused by
        > overdistention of bladder due to neurologic lesion or outﬂow
        > obstruction; postvoid residual markedly elevated

    -   Urinary tract infections commonly cause transient incontinence
        > or worsening of preexisting incontinence

    -   Urodynamic evaluation indicated when diagnosis is uncertain or
        > before surgical correction

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Urinary tract infection

    -   Mobility disorders affecting ability to get to the toilet

    -   Neurologic causes as outlined above

    -   Urinary ﬁstula, urethral diverticulum

    -   Medications: Diuretics, anticholinergics, antihistamines,
        α-adren- ergic blockers

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Exclude urinary tract infection

    -   A diary of voiding aids in diagnosis and guides therapy

    -   Kegel exercises, formal training of the pelvic muscles
        > (biofeedback)

    -   For urge incontinence: Timed voids, limit ﬂuid intake and
        > caffeine,

16

anticholinergic medications (oxybutynin chloride, tolterodine)

####  Vaginitis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Vaginal burning, pain, pruritus, discharge

    -   Results from atrophy, infection, or allergic reaction

    -   Common infectious causes include *Candida albicans, Trichomonas
        vaginalis,* bacterial vaginosis (*Gardnerella* and other
        anaerobes)

    -   *Trichomonas* is sexually transmitted and causes profuse,
        frothy, malodorous discharge and vaginal irritation

    -   Bacterial vaginosis may be asymptomatic or associated with a
        thin, gray, "ﬁshy" discharge

    -   *C. albicans* associated with pruritus, burning, and a thick,
        white, nonmalodorous discharge

    -   Wet mount with KOH, saline, and pH are usually diagnostic:
        Trichomonads are motile, pH \> 4.5; bacterial vaginosis reveals
        clue cells, pH \> 4.5; hyphae and spores with a normal pH (\<
        4.5) mean *Candida*

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Physiologic discharge, ovulation

    -   Atrophic vaginitis, vulvar dystrophies (lichen sclerosis), and
        vulvar neoplasia in older women

    -   Cervicitis, syphilis, herpesvirus outbreak

    -   Cervical carcinoma

    -   Foreign body (retained tampon)

    -   Contact dermatitis (eg, condoms, perfumed products, soap)

    -   Pubic lice, scabies

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Limit vaginal irritants

    -   Culture cervix for *N-eisseria gonorrhoeae* and *Chlamydia* if
        no other cause for symptoms

    -   For *T. vaginalis:* Metronidazole (2 g as a single dose) for

## Common Surgical Disorders

####  Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   More than 90% originate below the renal arteries

    -   Most asymptomatic, discovered incidentally

    -   Back or abdominal pain often precedes rupture

    -   Diameter is the most important predictor of aneurysm rupture (up
        > to a 40% risk of rupture over 5 years for aneurysms \> 5 cm)

    -   Four-fold higher incidence in men, but risk of rupture is two to
        four times more common in women

    -   Most rupture leftward and posteriorly; left knee jerk disappears

    -   Frequently associated with aneurysms in other locations, and all
        > patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms should be assessed
        > for concomitant femoral and popliteal aneurysms

    -   Ultrasound ideal for screening; CT for operative planning

    -   One-time ultrasound screening is recommended for men ≥ 65 years
        of age, and as early as 55 years of age if family history
        positive; one-time screening ultrasound recommended for women ≥
        65 if family history is positive, or history of tobacco use

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Pancreatic pseudocyst, pancreatitis, renal colic

    -   Penetrating (posterior) duodenal ulcer

-   ##### Treatment

    -   In asymptomatic healthy patients, surgery recommended for
        aneurysms \> 5.0 cm

    -   Resection may be beneﬁcial even for aneurysms as small as 4 cm
        > (women, ulcerated or saccular aneurysms)

    -   In symptomatic patients, immediate repair regardless of size

    -   Endovascular repair (transfemoral insertion of a prosthetic
        graft) considered if the anatomy of aneurysm is suitable and can
        be per- formed using local or epidural anesthesia for high-risk
        patients

    -   Smoking cessation important

####  Acute Appendicitis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Lifetime risk is 7%; 70% present before 30 years of age

    -   Perforations associated with a 20% mortality risk in the elderly

    -   Non-abrupt abdominal pain initially poorly localized or perium-
        bilical, then focal in right lower quadrant over 4--48 hours

    -   Pain followed by nausea with or without vomiting; anorexia

    -   Low-grade fever, right lower quadrant tenderness at McBurney's
        point with or without peritoneal signs

    -   Prolonged symptoms, high fever, rigors, localized pain, and
        marked leukocytosis often seen in perforation

    -   Pelvic and rectal exam may reveal tenderness, particularly in
        retrocecal appendicitis; microscopic hematuria or pyuria common

    -   Mild leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance; if WBC \>
        18,000/mL, consider rupture with localized abscess

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Gynecologic or urologic pathology (eg, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic

> inﬂammatory disease, ovarian or testicular torsion)

-   Gastroenteritis (idiopathic, cytomegalovirus, *Yersinia*
    enterocolitis)

-   Cecal or sigmoid colon diverticulitis; pancreatitis; cholecystitis

-   Bowel obstruction; intussusception; mesenteric adenitis

-   Perforated peptic ulcer; Crohn's; Meckel's diverticulitis; pneumonia

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ##### Treatment

    -   Patients with clinical manifestations consistent with
        nonruptured appendicitis should undergo urgent appendectomy

    -   Patients in whom the evaluation is not entirely consistent with
        appendicitis should undergo either ultrasound or CT scan

    -   For ruptured appendicitis, CT-guided drainage of localized
        abscess with later appendectomy; follow-up colonoscopy or CT
        imaging recommended after resolution of acute episode

    -   Up to 30% of patients have a normal appendix at operation

    -   When diagnosis unclear, observe with serial examinations

####  Acute Cholecystitis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Caused by obstruction of the gallbladder, typically by
        > gallstones, but also due to malignancy, polyps, lymph nodes,
        > and parasites

    -   Gallstones are present in up to 35% of the adult population;
        > only 1--3% of these patients will develop cholecystitis

    -   Acalculous cholecystitis, which comprises 2--15% of patients
        > with cholecystitis, is caused by bile stasis, sludge
        > formation, and bacterial overgrowth resulting in gallbladder
        > obstruction

    -   Escalating right upper quadrant or epigastric pain over 12--24
        hours that may be colicky in nature, but never completely
        resolves; malaise, nausea, fever, and vomiting are typical

    -   Classic ﬁnding is Murphy's sign (an inspiratory arrest with pal-
        pation in the right upper quadrant)

    -   Signs and symptoms of common bile duct obstruction, including
        > tea-colored urine, clay-colored stools, scleral icterus

    -   Fever, leukocytosis, slight elevation in liver function studies,
        > and occasionally an elevation in amylase and lipase; bilirubin
        > eleva- tion \> 3 mg/dL concerning for common bile duct
        > obstruction

    -   Ultrasound is useful and may reveal stones, ductal dilation
        > (common bile duct \> 8 mm concerning for obstruction), and
        > inﬂammation (thickened gallbladder wall, pericholecystic ﬂuid)

    -   Radionuclide hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan is the
        > most accurate test (97% sensitive and 87% speciﬁc)

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Acute appendicitis; pancreatitis; hepatitis; pneumonia

    -   Gastroenteritis; peptic ulcer; myocardial infarction

    -   Radicular pain in thoracic dermatome (eg, preeruptive zoster)

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Bowel rest, ﬂuids, analgesics, and antibiotics

    -   Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 48 hours of onset of
        > symptoms) leads to reduced morbidity and mortality

17

-   Immediate cholecystectomy for gallbladder ischemia, perfora-

> tion, emphysematous cholecystitis

-   Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with
    > sphincterotomy should be performed when there is evidence of
    > common bile duct stones, pancreatitis, or cholangitis

####  Acute Lower-Extremity Arterial Occlusion 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Important to discern whether the patient has embolic,
        thrombotic, or traumatic etiology resulting in lower-extremity
        ischemia

    -   Most common source of emboli is cardiac (80--90%); 60--70% of
        these patients have underlying cardiac disease such as
        myocardial infarction, valvular disease, arrhythmia,
        endocarditis

    -   Traumatic causes include posterior knee dislocation, iatrogenic
        catheter injury, penetrating trauma (gunshot wound or stab
        injury)

    -   Thrombotic occlusion occurs most commonly in underlying ath-
        erosclerotic disease with a new acute insult (low-ﬂow state,
        injury)

    -   Classic manifestations of ischemia are the 6 P's: pain, pallor,
        paresthesias, paralysis, poikilothermia, and pulselessness; pain
        is ﬁrst and most common, paralysis is late

    -   Signs of ischemia are most pronounced at the next joint distal
        to the level of occlusion

    -   Embolic events typically present with the sudden onset of pain
        in the setting of an arrhythmia; contralateral vascular
        examination is normal

    -   Thrombotic events typically present with a slower onset of less
        severe symptoms, a history of claudication, rest pain, and
        periph- eral vascular disease; exam may reveal stigmata of
        chronic bilateral vascular disease

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Neuropathic pain; reﬂex sympathetic dystrophy

    -   Deep venous thrombosis

    -   Systemic vasculitis; cholesterol atheroemboli

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Heparin should be given in patients without a contraindication
        in order to prevent propagation of the embolus or thrombosis and
        maintain patency of collateral vessels; aspirin also given

    -   Re-establish blood ﬂow via surgical embolectomy or catheter-
        directed thrombolysis

    -   Fasciotomy is indicated if ischemia is estimated to be longer
        than

####  Cerebral Vascular Occlusive Disease 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Most common in patients with standard risk factors for
        > atheroscle- rosis (eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
        > diabetes, smoking)

    -   Majority of patients asymptomatic

    -   Symptoms: Transient monocular blindness (amaurosis fugax),
        transient hemiparesis with or without aphasia or sensory changes
        lasting \< 20 minutes (transient ischemic attack)

    -   Bruit may be present but correlates poorly with degree of
        > stenosis

    -   Duplex ultrasound useful in assessing stenosis; gadolinium
        > angiography is indicated only when the anatomy is not clearly
        > delineated on ultrasound

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Carotid artery dissection

    -   Steal syndromes

    -   Giant cell arteritis

    -   Takayasu's arteritis

    -   Lipohyalinosis

    -   Radiation ﬁbrosis

    -   Cardiac emboli

    -   Brain tumor or abscess (in patient with stroke)

    -   Fibromuscular dysplasia

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Thrombolytic agents in carefully selected patients with cerebral

ischemia: Less than 3 hours of symptoms, no hemorrhage on CT

-   Carotid endarterectomy is appropriate for those patients with
    carotid stenosis \> 80% without symptoms or stenosis \> 60% with
    symptoms (based on duplex ultrasound evaluation)

-   Indications for carotid angioplasty and stenting are controversial;
    asymptomatic patients with multiple comorbidities and contralateral
    occlusion may be most appropriate, but long-term data unavailable

17

-   Long-term antiplatelet therapy, antihypertensive agents,
    angiotensin-

####  Diverticulitis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Approximately 10--25% of patients with diverticula develop
        > diver- ticulitis over their lifetime

    -   Acute, intermittent cramping left lower abdominal pain with
        > change in bowel habits (often constipation alternating with
        > diar- rhea), low-grade fever, and leukocytosis

    -   A tender, palpable abdominal mass may be present on examination

    -   Abdominal distension with nausea and vomiting may be present due
        to associated ileus or obstruction from inﬂammation

    -   Symptoms of ﬁstulization to bladder (pneumaturia, fecaluria) or
        vagina (foul-smelling drainage or passage of stool from vagina)
        may be present in long-standing disease

    -   CT scan is diagnostic method of choice; water-soluble contrast
        should be used instead of barium if perforation suspected

    -   Consider cystography or cystoscopy if concern for urinary ﬁstula

    -   Endoscopy not useful in the acute setting

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Colorectal carcinoma; appendicitis; urinary tract infection

    -   Colonic obstruction; ischemic or infectious colitis

    -   Pelvic inﬂammatory disease

    -   Ruptured ectopic pregnancy or ovarian cyst

    -   Inﬂammatory bowel disease; nephrolithiasis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Liquid diet (10 days) and 7- to 10-day course of oral
        antibiotics (metronidazole plus ﬂuoroquinolone) for mild ﬁrst
        attack

    -   Nasogastric suction and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics
        for patients requiring hospitalization

    -   Percutaneous catheter drainage for intra-abdominal abscess

    -   Emergent laparotomy with colonic resection and diversion for
        generalized peritonitis, perforation, clinical deterioration

    -   High-residue diet, stool softener, psyllium for chronic therapy

    -   Elective sigmoid colectomy for recurrent attacks or complicated

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Severely impaired transit of intestinal contents due to
        > decreased peristalsis in the absence of mechanical obstruction

    -   Most commonly occurs after surgery, but also in the setting of
        > peritonitis, intra-abdominal infection or inﬂammation (eg,
        > pan- creatitis), critical illness, electrolyte derangements,
        > narcotic use, anticholinergic drugs, pneumonia, uremia

    -   Progressive abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting, and obstipation

    -   Minimal abdominal tenderness; decreased to absent bowel sounds

    -   Radiographic images show diffuse gastrointestinal distention, no
        > obvious transition point, and air in the rectum; consider CT
        > if plain ﬁlms are equivocal

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Mechanical obstruction due to any cause

    -   Perforated viscus; intra-abdominal abscess

    -   Colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome)

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Resolution may not occur for 7--10 days

    -   Restriction of oral intake including oral medications;
        > nasogastric suction in those with protracted vomiting or
        > gastric distension

    -   Minimize narcotics and anticholinergic drugs; prokinetic drugs
        > (metoclopramide, erythromycin) if no evidence of obstruction

    -   Early ambulation and gum chewing may shorten course

    -   Attention to electrolyte disorders (eg, hypokalemia) and dehy-

####  Inguinal Hernia 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   A weakness in the abdominal wall results in the protrusion of
        structures (ie, adipose tissue, viscus) through the defect

    -   Usually presents as a mass or swelling in the groin; can be
        > associ- ated with sudden pain and bulging during heavy lifting
        > or straining

    -   95% of groin hernias involve the inguinal canal; 5% involve the
        femoral canal; typically asymptomatic and found on routine
        screening; discomfort worse at end of the day, relieved when
        patient reclines and hernia reduces

    -   Indirect hernias, which develop through the internal inguinal
        > ring and lie lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels, are
        > likely congenital

    -   Direct hernias are more common, lie medial to the inferior epi-
        > gastric vessels, and result from weakness in the inguinal ﬂoor

    -   Femoral hernias, the least common, are most likely to present as
        > surgical emergencies

    -   Early symptoms of incarceration are those of partial bowel
        obstruction (vomiting, distention, obstipation)

    -   Incarcerated hernias cannot be reduced and may be tender; stran-
        gulated hernias are warm and erythematous due to underlying
        ischemia

    -   Always examine patients in the standing position as well as
        > supine to allow the hernia sac to ﬁll

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Hydrocele; varicocele; inguinal lymphadenopathy

    -   Testicular torsion; femoral artery aneurysm

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Most should be repaired unless various conditions preclude

    -   Elective outpatient surgical repair for reducible hernias

    -   Attempt reduction of incarcerated (irreducible) hernias when
        peri- toneal signs are absent with conscious sedation,
        Trendelenburg

####  Malignant Tumors of the Esophagus 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Early cancers rarely present with symptoms

    -   Progressive dysphagia---initially during ingestion of solid
        > foods, later with liquids with retrosternal pain; weight loss
        > ominous; hoarseness and productive cough may indicate invasion
        > into the laryngeal nerves or tracheobronchial tree

    -   Smoking and alcohol associated with squamous cell carcinoma
        > (proximal and mid-esophagus); obesity, Barrett's esophagus,
        > and gastroesophageal reﬂux associated with adenocarcinoma
        > (distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction);
        > adenocarcinoma more common

    -   Barium esophagram is diagnostic procedure of choice and typi-
        > cally shows irregular mucosal pattern or concentrically
        > narrowed esophageal lumen

    -   Endoscopy can allow for tumor visualization, biopsy, and endo-
        > scopic ultrasound to determine the depth of the lesion

    -   CT scan with positron emission tomography (PET) delineates
        extent of disease and distant metastases

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Benign esophageal tumor or stricture

    -   Esophageal diverticulum or web; achalasia; globus hystericus

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Tumor invasion or metastasis at time of presentation precludes
        > cure in most

    -   Open surgical approaches, either transthoracic (Ivor-Lewis) or
        > transhiatal, are most commonly used, but minimally inva- sive
        > techniques are gaining favor; endoscopic mucosal resec- tion
        > may be an option for very early disease

    -   Chemoradiation followed by surgical resection indicated for
        advanced disease (T2--4, N1), but 5-year survival remains 40%

17

-   Therapies focused on reducing dysphagia and maintaining oral

####  Mesenteric Ischemia 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

> *Acute:*

-   Emboli commonly due to atrial ﬁbrillation, myocardial infarc- tion;
    often lodges in the superior mesenteric artery

-   Nonocclusive insufﬁciency is due to a low ﬂow state, frequently seen
    with heart failure, hypovolemia, and vasopressor use

-   Venous occlusion leading to arterial insufﬁciency is associated with
    hypercoagulable states, pancreatitis, and portal hypertension

-   Pain out of proportion to exam present in 95%

-   Usually history of atherosclerotic vascular disease with stigmata of
    vascular disease present on exam (eg, diminished pulses)

-   Labs normal early; leukocytosis and elevated lactate occur later

-   CT scan conﬁrms the diagnosis in 90%; angiography is more accurate
    and may allow for catheter-based thrombolytic therapy

> *Chronic:*

-   Results from atherosclerotic plaques of superior mesenteric, celiac
    axis, and inferior mesenteric; more than one of these major arter-
    ies must be involved because of collateral circulation

-   Epigastric or periumbilical postprandial pain; patients limit intake
    to avoid pain, with weight loss and less pain

-   Patients typically have a history of smoking, peripheral vascular
    disease, and hypertension; 50% have abdominal bruit

> *Ischemic colitis:*

-   Colonic ischemia due to inferior mesenteric artery or hypogastric
    arterial insufﬁciency secondary to a low ﬂow state; episodic bouts
    of crampy lower abdominal pain and mild, often bloody diarrhea

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Diverticulitis; appendicitis; pancreatitis; cholecystitis

    -   Inﬂammatory bowel disease and colitis due to other causes

    -   Visceral malignancy; polyarteritis nodosa; renal colic

    -   Expanding aortic aneurysm; aortic dissection

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Goals of laparotomy: removal of necrotic bowel, salvage remain-

#####  17 

ing bowel, and preserve intestinal length

-   Surgical embolectomy or bypass of the occluded portion of the
    superior mesenteric artery

-   Intra-arterial papaverine in some with nonocclusive ischemia

####  Pancreatic Pseudocyst 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Organized collection of pancreatic ﬂuid in or around the pan-
        creas; may complicate acute or chronic pancreatitis

    -   The majority (80%) of pancreatic ﬂuid collections that occur \<
        8 weeks after the inciting event will resolve spontaneously

    -   Symptomatic Pseudocysts are typically 6 cm and present for more
        than 6 weeks

    -   Symptoms are associated with local mass effect and local inﬂam-
        mation and include occasional fever, epigastric pain with back
        radiation, early satiety

    -   Leukocytosis, persistent serum amylase elevation may be present;
        > however, laboratory studies can be normal

    -   Pancreatic cyst demonstrated by sonography or CT scan

    -   Complications include hemorrhage (erosion into pancreatic ves-
        sels), infection, rupture, ﬁstula formation, pancreatic ascites,
        obstruction of adjacent structures (gastric outlet, bowel)

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Pancreatic phlegmon or abscess; aortic aneurysm

    -   Sterile pancreatic necrosis; resolving pancreatitis

    -   Pancreatic carcinoma and cystic neoplasms

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Up to two-thirds spontaneously resolve; no intervention for
        uncom- plicated acute ﬂuid collections or asymptomatic
        pseudocysts

    -   Avoidance of alcohol; treatment of other causes of the initial
        > pan- creatitis (eg, hypertriglyceridemia, medications,
        > gallstones)

    -   Percutaneous catheter drainage associated with complications;
        > only consider in patients with symptomatic pseudocysts who
        > cannot undergo endoscopic or surgical intervention due to
        > comor- bidities and with normal ductal anatomy

    -   ERCP with sphincterotomy and pancreatic duct stent for proxi-
        mal decompression can aid in spontaneous resolution

17

-   Decompression into an adjacent hollow viscus (stomach, duode-

> num, jejunum) may be necessary and can be performed via endo- scopic
> or surgical (laparoscopic or open) techniques

-   Octreotide to inhibit pancreatic secretion not of beneﬁt

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Most prevalent in the ﬁfth to eighth decades of life

    -   Results from herniation of the mucosa through a weak point in
        the muscle layer between the oblique ﬁbers of the
        thyropharyngeus and the horizontal ﬁbers of the cricopharyngeus
        (Killian's triangle)

    -   Dysphagia is present in 90% of patients and worsens as the pouch
        enlarges; other symptoms include regurgitation of undigested
        food, halitosis, hoarseness, chronic cough, malnutrition, and
        weight loss

    -   Gurgling sounds in the neck on auscultation are pathognomonic;
        cervical crepitus occasionally present

    -   Barium swallow conﬁrms diagnosis by demonstrating the sac

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Esophageal, mediastinal, or neck tumor

    -   Esophageal duplication cyst

    -   Cricopharyngeal achalasia (occasionally associated)

    -   Esophageal web

    -   Achalasia or lower esophageal stricture

    -   Epiphrenic diverticulum (lower esophagus)

    -   Cervical osteophyte

    -   Thyroid mass

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Untreated Zenker's diverticula can lead to bezoar, tracheal
        ﬁstula, vocal cord paralysis, ﬁstula to the paravertebral
        ligament leading to cervical osteomyelitis, peptic ulceration,
        and hemorrhage

    -   There is no medical therapy; all patients should be considered
        can- didates for cricopharyngeal myotomy extending onto the
        esoph- agus with either a diverticulopexy (\< 2 cm) or a
        diverticular resection (\> 2 cm)

    -   Endoscopic techniques can be used in a subset of patients and

####  Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Partial or complete obstruction of the intestinal lumen by an
        intrin- sic or extrinsic lesion

    -   Etiology: Adhesions (eg, from prior surgery or pelvic inﬂamma-
        tory disease) 60%, malignancy 20%, hernia 10%, inﬂammatory

> bowel disease 5%, volvulus 3%, other (eg, gallstone ileus) 2%

-   Crampy or colicky abdominal pain, vomiting (often feculent in
    complete obstruction), abdominal distention, constipation, or
    obstipation; absence of ﬂatus may indicate complete obstruction

-   Distended, tender abdomen with or without peritoneal signs; high-
    > pitched tinkling or peristaltic rushes audible

-   Patients often intravascularly volume-depleted secondary to emesis,
    decreased oral intake, and sequestration of ﬂuid into the bowel
    wall, bowel lumen, and the peritoneal cavity

-   Plain ﬁlms of the abdomen show dilated small bowel with more than
    three air-ﬂuid levels; contrast-enhanced CT scan can reveal evidence
    of bowel ischemia (thickened walls, pneumatosis, mesen- teric
    inﬂammation)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Adynamic ileus due to any cause (eg, hypokalemia, pancreatitis,
        nephrolithiasis, recent operation or trauma)

    -   Colonic obstruction

    -   Intestinal pseudo-obstruction

    -   Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Nasogastric suction

    -   Fluid and electrolyte (potassium, magnesium, phosphorus)
        replace- ment with isotonic crystalloid, and close monitoring of
        urine output

    -   The decision for surgical intervention based on the degree of
        obstruction (partial vs. complete), etiology of obstruction (50%

17

of adhesion-related obstructions resolve spontaneously), and con-

> cern for bowel strangulation and necrosis

-   Surgical exploration indicated for suspected strangulated hernia,
    obstruction not responsive to conservative therapy, or the devel-
    opment of peritoneal signs

## Common Pediatric Disorders^∗^

####  Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Cause of childhood leukemias; peak at ages 2--6 years

    -   Chromosomal abnormalities (eg, Down's syndrome)

    -   Intermittent fever, bone pain, petechiae, purpura, pallor, mild
        splenomegaly without hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy

    -   Anemia and thrombocytopenia are common; leukocyte counts often
        less than 10,000/μL; lymphocytes described as atypical

    -   Bone marrow shows homogeneous inﬁltration of more than 25% of
        leukemic blasts; most express common ALL antigen (CALLA)

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus infection

    -   Immune thrombocytopenic purpura

    -   Aplastic anemia

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Induction with prednisone, vincristine, asparaginase, and occa-
        sionally daunorubicin; intrathecal methotrexate and/or
        cytarabine if at high risk for relapse

    -   CNS therapy (intrathecal chemotherapy, sometimes cranial
        irradiation) to treat lymphoblasts present in meninges and to
        prevent CNS relapse

    -   Maintenance therapy with mercaptopurine, weekly methotrex- ate,
        and monthly vincristine or prednisone

    -   Bone marrow transplant considered in selected patients

    -   Younger children, WBC \> 100,000 have worse prognosis; likewise
        t(9;22) and t(4;11) translocations

####  Bacterial Meningitis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Signs of systemic illness (fever, malaise, poor feeding);
        > headache, stiff neck, and altered mental status in older
        > children

    -   In infants and young children, signs of meningeal irritation
        > (Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs) may be absent

    -   Predisposing factors include ear infection, sinusitis, recent
        > neu- rosurgical procedures, and skull fracture

    -   No symptom or sign reliably distinguishes bacterial cause from
        > meningitis due to viruses, fungi, or other pathogens

    -   Organisms depend upon the age

    -   Age less than 2 months: Group B or D streptococci, gram-negative
        > bacilli, *Listeria*

    -   Ages 2 months to 12 years: *Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, Streptococcus
        > pneumoniae,* and *Neisseria meningitidis*

    -   Cerebrospinal ﬂuid shows elevated protein, low glucose, elevated
        > WBC (\> 1000/μL) with a high percent of neutrophils (\> 50%)

    -   Gram stain and culture often lead to the deﬁnitive diagnosis

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Meningitis due to nonbacterial organisms

    -   Brain abscess; encephalitis

    -   Sepsis without meningitis; intracranial mass or hemorrhage

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Prompt empiric antibiotics can be life-saving; exact regimen
        > depends on patient's age; therapy narrowed once
        > susceptibilities known

    -   Concomitant dexamethasone decreases morbidity and mortality in
        > patients with meningitis secondary to *H. inﬂuenzae;* unclear
        > beneﬁt if meningitis is due to other bacterial causes

    -   Patients monitored for acidosis, syndrome of inappropriate
        > secre- tion of antidiuretic hormone, and hypoglycemia

    -   Coagulopathies may require platelets and fresh-frozen plasma

    -   Mortality can be up to 10% in neonates; severe neurologic seque-
        > lae may occur in 10--25% of affected patients

####  Colic 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   A syndrome characterized by severe and paroxysmal crying that
        usually worsens in the late afternoon and evening

    -   Abdomen sometimes distended, the facies pained, ﬁsts often
        clenched; infant unresponsive to soothing

    -   An abnormal sensitivity of the gastrointestinal tract to stimuli
        may contribute to its pathogenesis, but its exact etiology is
        unknown

    -   Most cases present between the ages of 1--3 months

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Normal crying in an infant

    -   Intussusception

    -   Volvulus

    -   Gastroenteritis

    -   Constipation

    -   Any illness in the infant causing distress (eg, otitis media,
        corneal abrasion)

    -   Food allergy

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Reassurance to parents; education regarding the baby's cues

    -   Elimination of cow's milk from formula (or from the mother's
        diet if she is nursing) in refractory cases to rule out milk
        protein allergy

    -   Soothing with massage, creating a comfortable environment (eg,
        playing soothing music), avoidance of overfeeding may be useful
        adjuncts

    -   Hypoallergenic diet and soy formula have not been demonstrated
        to have clear beneﬁt, but may be helpful in difﬁcult cases

    -   Phenobarbital elixir and dicyclomine not recommended

-   ##### Pearl

####  Constipation 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Deﬁned as infrequent bowel movements associated with difﬁ- culty
        > passing; stools are often hard in consistency

    -   Can lead to painful defecation and eventually stool withholding
        > and encopresis

    -   May be caused by anatomic abnormalities, neurologic problems, or
        > endocrine disorders; in most cases, however, no cause is
        > identiﬁed

    -   A positive family history may be elicited

    -   Rectal examination to evaluate ﬁssures and assess rectal tone

    -   Abdominal radiograph may conﬁrm the diagnosis

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Hirschsprung's disease

    -   Hypothyroidism

    -   Hyperparathyroidism

    -   Congenital gastrointestinal malformation

    -   Infantile botulism

    -   Lead intoxication

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Impacted children will usually require a clean-out; although
        > enemas are sometimes used, severe impaction may require oral
        > polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution

    -   Mainstay of therapy is behavioral; long course of toilet sitting
        > and positive feedback necessary; biofeedback may be helpful

    -   Close follow-up with families for support is critical

    -   Dietary changes (increased ﬁber and lower milk and caffeine
        > intake) usually beneﬁcial

    -   Mineral oil titrated to one or two soft stools per day is a
        > recom- mended ﬁrst-line agent

    -   Lactulose or docusate sodium may be useful in difﬁcult cases

    -   Laxatives should not be used as a long-term solution

    -   Families need to be reassured that functional constipation is
        > difﬁ- cult to cure and that months to years of treatment may
        > be necessary

####  Croup 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Affects children predominantly between ages 3 months and 5
        years; more common during fall and winter

    -   Children often febrile, but not toxic appearing

    -   Barking cough, stridor, and hoarseness following upper respira-
        tory infection symptoms, typically worse at night

    -   Lateral neck ﬁlms can be useful; viral croup may show subglot-
        tic narrowing (steeple sign), normal epiglottis

    -   Direct laryngoscopy may cause airway obstruction if bacterial
        epiglottitis present

    -   Croup may recur, but usually lessens in severity with age as
        airway diameter increases

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Foreign body in the esophagus or larynx

    -   Retropharyngeal abscess

    -   Epiglottitis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Mist therapy utility is anecdotal

    -   Corticosteroids reduce the number of return visits to the emer-
        gency department, but may not shorten course of disease

    -   Oxygen and racemic epinephrine are accepted therapy

####  Enuresis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Involuntary urination at an age at which control is expected
        (cog- nitive age of approximately 5 years), mostly occurring at
        night

    -   Primary enuresis occurs in children who have never had control
        and accounts for nearly 90% of cases; secondary in children with
        at least 6 months of prior control

    -   Symptoms must be present at least twice per week for at least 6
        months to make the diagnosis

    -   Approximately 75% of children with enuresis have at least one
        parent who had similar difﬁculties as a child

    -   Affects 7% of boys and 3% of girls at age 5; decreasing to 3% of
        boys and 2% of girls by age 10

    -   Secondary enuresis often caused by psychosocial stressors

    -   Medical problems, including urinary tract infection and diabetes
        mellitus, must be excluded

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Urinary tract infection

    -   Diabetes mellitus

    -   Congenital genitourinary anomalies

    -   Constipation

    -   Child abuse

    -   Behavioral difﬁculties

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Therapy for causative medical problems

    -   Support and positive reinforcement for children and families

    -   Fluid restriction and bladder emptying before bedtime

    -   Alarm systems effective, but may take weeks to work

    -   Desmopressin works quickly but does not provide long-term
        control

    -   Imipramine not recommended due to side effects and overdose
        potential

####  Febrile Seizures 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Occur in 2--5% of children

    -   Peak between 14 and 18 months of age; most common between age 9
        > months and 5 years

    -   Last less than 15 minutes, are generalized, and occur in
        > develop- mentally normal children

    -   Seizures lasting more than 15 minutes, persistent neurologic
        > deﬁcits, or recurrent seizures are considered complex

    -   The development of a febrile seizure is associated with the rate
        > of rise of the child's temperature, not the temperature's peak

    -   Risk factors include positive family history or previous
        > personal history of febrile seizures

    -   One in three will have a recurrent seizure, 75% within a year

    -   Risk of developing epilepsy is approximately 1% in children
        > with- out risk factors; up to 9% of children with risk factors
        > (eg, posi- tive family history, atypical seizure type or
        > duration, underlying neurologic disease) will develop epilepsy

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Meningitis

    -   Encephalitis

    -   Intracranial hemorrhage

    -   Intracranial tumor

    -   Trauma

-   ##### Treatment

    -   No treatment for simple febrile seizures

    -   Electroencephalography not recommended in the initial evaluation

    -   Lumbar puncture indicated in children under 12 months of age if
        > no source of infection can be found

    -   Prophylactic anticonvulsants may lower the risk of recurrence,
        > but are not recommended routinely

####  Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (Anaphylactoid Purpura) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   A small-vessel vasculitis affecting skin, gastrointestinal
        tract, and kidney

    -   Typically occurs between ages 2 and 8 years; boys affected more
        often than girls (2:1); occasionally observed in adults

    -   Two-thirds of patients have a preceding upper respiratory tract
        infection

    -   Skin lesions often begin as urticaria and progress to a macu-
        lopapular eruption, ﬁnally becoming a symmetric purpuric rash
        that often begins on the buttocks and lower extremities

    -   Eighty percent develop migratory polyarthralgias or
        polyarthritis; edema of the hands, feet, scalp, and periorbital
        areas occurs commonly

    -   Colicky abdominal pain occurs in two-thirds, and it may be com-
        plicated by intussusception

    -   Renal involvement in 25--50%

    -   Platelet count, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin
        time normal; urinalysis may reveal hematuria and proteinuria;
        serum IgA often elevated

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Immune thrombocytopenic purpura

    -   Meningococcemia

    -   Rocky Mountain spotted fever

    -   Other hypersensitivity vasculitides

    -   Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis

    -   Kawasaki's disease

    -   Child abuse

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Pain medications and NSAIDs to treat joint pain and inﬂammation

    -   Corticosteroid therapy may decrease duration of abdominal pain,
        but does not appear to alter skin or renal manifestations

    -   No satisfactory speciﬁc treatment

    -   Prognosis is generally good; less than 1% of patients have
        resid-

> ual renal disease

####  Intussusception 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Telescoping of one part of the bowel into another, leading to
        > edema, hemorrhage, ischemia, and eventually infarction

    -   The most common cause of intestinal obstruction in the ﬁrst 6
        > years of life; boys are affected more commonly than girls
        > (4:1)

    -   Majority (80%) of cases occur before 2 years of age

    -   Lead points include hypertrophied Peyer's patches, intestinal
        > polyps, lymphoma, or other tumors; in children over 6,
        > lymphoma most common lesion

    -   Most (90%) are ileocolic; ileoileal or colocolic may occur

    -   Symptoms include intermittent colicky abdominal pain, vomiting,
        > and bloody stool (currant jelly stools); children are often
        > asymp- tomatic between bouts of pain

    -   Plain ﬁlms may show signs of obstruction, but a barium or air-
        > barium enema is the standard for diagnosis

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Volvulus

    -   Incarcerated hernia

    -   Acute appendicitis

    -   Acute gastroenteritis

    -   Urinary tract infection

    -   Small bowel obstruction due to other cause

    -   Henoch-Schönlein purpura

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Patients stabilized with ﬂuid; decompressed with a nasogastric
        > tube

    -   Surgical consultation to exclude perforation

    -   Air-barium enema has a reduction rate of up to 90%, but it is
        > never performed if perforation is suspected; reduction by
        > enema may result in perforation in 1%

    -   If perforation occurs or if enema fails, surgical decompression
        > may be necessary

    -   Recurs in up to 10% of cases if reduced via enema, usually in
        > the

####  Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (Still's Disease) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Useful diagnostic criteria: Age of onset less than 16 years;
        dura- tion greater than 6 weeks; true arthritis must be present;
        other etiologies that cause arthritis must be excluded

    -   Three types: Oligoarticular, polyarticular, and systemic

    -   Oligoarticular: Fewer than ﬁve joints involved, predominantly
        large joints in the lower extremities

    -   Polyarticular: More than ﬁve joints involved; affects both large
        and small joints; rheumatoid nodules are often present

    -   Systemic: Arthritis characterized by quotidian fever; fevers may
        be accompanied by evanescent salmon-colored rash; pervasive
        visceral involvement including hepatosplenomegaly,
        lymphadenopathy, and serositis

    -   Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein often
        elevated but nonspeciﬁc; antinuclear antibody elevated in
        40--85% of cases, more commonly in oligo- and polyarthritis

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Rheumatic fever; infective arthritis; Lyme disease

    -   Reactive arthritis due to various causes

    -   Systemic lupus erythematosus; dermatomyositis; leukemia

    -   Inﬂammatory bowel disease; bone tumors; osteomyelitis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Stepwise approach to therapy is essential; goals of treatment
        are to restore joint function and relieve pain

    -   NSAIDs and physical therapy are the mainstays

    -   Methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, and local cor-
        ticosteroid injections for those symptomatic after NSAIDs

    -   Azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and systemic steroids may be
        necessary for treatment of refractory cases

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Illness of unknown etiology characterized by sometimes severe
        > vasculitis primarily of medium-sized arteries; 80% of cases
        > occur before the age of 5 years

    -   Criteria for diagnosis include fever for 5 days and at least
        > four of the following: Bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis;
        > involvement of mucous membranes (eg, ﬁssuring of lips,
        > strawberry tongue); cervical lymphadenopathy of at least 1.5
        > cm; rash; and changes in extremities (edema, desquamation)

    -   Arthritis common

    -   Cardiovascular complications include myocarditis, pericarditis,
        > and arteritis predisposing to coronary artery aneurysm
        > formation

    -   Acute myocardial infarction may occur; 1--2% of patients die
        > from this complication during the initial phase of the disease

    -   Thrombocytosis, elevated sedimentation rate typical

    -   Patients require echocardiogram to evaluate for coronary
        > aneurysms

    -   No speciﬁc test is yet available; the diagnosis of Kawasaki's
        > disease is based on clinical criteria and exclusion of other
        > possibilities

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Acute rheumatic fever

    -   Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis

    -   Viral exanthems

    -   Infectious mononucleosis

    -   Streptococcal pharyngitis

    -   Measles

    -   Toxic shock syndrome

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Intravenous immune globulin and high-dose aspirin are the main-

####  Otitis Media 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Peak incidence between the ages of 6 months and 3 years

    -   History may include fever, ear pain, and other nonspeciﬁc
        systemic symptoms (eg, vomiting, poor feeding)

    -   Tympanometry shows an opaque, bulging, hyperemic tympanic
        membrane with a loss of landmarks; pneumatic otoscopy shows loss
        of mobility

    -   Breastfeeding probably protective

    -   Exposure to tobacco smoke and paciﬁer use thought to increase
        incidence; other risk factors include craniofacial or congenital
        anomalies (eg, cleft palate)

    -   Although caused by viruses, most cases assumed to be bacterial

    -   Bacterial causes are (1) *Streptococcus pneumoniae,* 40--50%;

\(2\) *Haemophilus inﬂuenzae,* 20--30%; (3) *Moraxella catarrhalis,*

> 10--15%

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Otitis externa

    -   Cholesteatoma

    -   Foreign body

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Treatment controversial; most children with otitis media not
        treated in Europe

    -   CDC recommendations: (1) Children \> 2 years not in day care and
        not exposed to antibiotics in the last 3 months, amoxicillin
        40--45 mg/kg per day for 5 days; (2) children \< 2 years in day
        care or with recent antibiotic exposure, high-dose amoxicillin
        80--100 mg/kg per day for 10 days; (3) second-line therapy
        includes amoxi- cillin clavulanate, cefuroxime, or intramuscular
        ceftriaxone

    -   Three or more episodes in 6 months or four episodes in a year
        war- rant prophylactic antibiotics; tympanostomy tubes
        considered with persistent infection

####  Pyloric Stenosis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Increase in size of the muscular layer of the pylorus of unknown
        > etiology

    -   Occurs in approximately 3 per 1000 births; boys: girls 4:1;
        > Caucasians more commonly affected than African-Americans or
        > Asians

    -   Vomiting usually begins between 2 and 8 weeks of age but may
        > occur as early as 1 week of age or as late as 5 months

    -   Emesis often described by parents as projectile; rarely bilious

    -   Infant is hungry and nurses avidly, but weight gain is poor and
        > growth retardation occurs

    -   Dehydration and hypokalemic hypochloremic alkalosis are
        > characteristic

    -   Palpable olive-sized mass in the subhepatic region best felt
        > after the child has vomited

    -   Ultrasound is 90% sensitive

    -   Barium studies, not commonly performed, demonstrate increased
        > pyloric channel and bulge of pyloric muscle into antrum
        > (shoul- der sign)

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Gastroesophageal reﬂux disease

    -   Esophageal stenosis or achalasia

    -   Duodenal stenosis

    -   Small bowel obstruction due to other causes

    -   Antral web

    -   Adrenal insufﬁciency

    -   Pylorospasm

    -   Inborn errors of metabolism

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Ramstedt's pyloromyotomy is curative and the treatment of choice

####  Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Bronchiolitis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   The major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children less
        than 1 year of age

    -   Epidemics with seasonal variability most common from late fall
        to early spring

    -   Clinical presentation of bronchiolitis is characterized by
        variable fever, cough, tachypnea, diffuse wheezing, inspiratory
        retractions, and difﬁculty feeding

    -   Apnea may be the presenting symptom, especially in newborns and
        infants

    -   Chest x-ray shows hyperinﬂation and peribronchiolar thickening
        with occasional atelectasis

    -   RSV antigen detected in nasal or pulmonary secretions is
        diagnostic

    -   Diagnosis often made clinically

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Bronchiolitis due to other viruses or bacteria

    -   Asthma

    -   Community-acquired pneumonia

    -   Pertussis

    -   Foreign body aspiration

    -   Chlamydial pneumonitis

    -   Laryngomalacia

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Severely ill children should be hospitalized, given humidiﬁed
        oxygen, and kept in respiratory isolation to prevent spread to
        other patients

    -   Bronchodilator therapy, although usually instituted, has not
        been demonstrated to reduce the severity of symptoms or shorten
        the course of disease

    -   Corticosteroids considered in hospitalized patients, though they
        may not reduce symptom severity or shorten disease course

    -   Ribavirin may be given to selected patients at very high risk
        for

####  Roseola Infantum (Exanthema Subitum) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   A benign illness typically caused by human herpes virus 6,
        > occur- ring with a peak incidence between 6 and 15 months of
        > age; 95% of cases occur before the third year

    -   Abrupt onset of fever (as high as 40°C) lasting from 3 to 5 days
        > in an otherwise mildly ill child; dissociation between
        > systemic symptoms and febrile course

    -   No conjunctivitis or pharyngeal exudate; mild cough or coryza
        > occasionally present

    -   Fever ceases abruptly; a characteristic rash develops within
        > 12--24 hours after becoming afebrile in 20%, consisting of
        > rose-pink maculopapules beginning on the trunk and spreading
        > outward with disappearance in 1--2 days

    -   Rash may occur without fever

    -   EBV

    -   Measles

    -   Rubella

    -   Enterovirus infection

    -   Scarlet fever

    -   Drug allergy

    -   Kawasaki's disease

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Supportive care only; antipyretics for fever control

    -   Reassurance for parents

    -   Febrile seizures occur, but no more commonly than with other
        > self- limited infections

    -   Children are no longer infectious once afebrile

####  Tetralogy of Fallot 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Most common cause of cyanotic heart disease after 1 week of age

    -   Components include right ventricular outﬂow tract obstruction,
        overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect, and right
        ventricular hypertrophy

    -   Varying cyanosis after the neonatal period, dyspnea on exertion,
        easy fatigability, growth retardation

    -   Exam may be notable for right ventricular lift, harsh systolic
        ejec- tion murmur maximal at the left sternal border, single
        loud S~2~

    -   Studies may demonstrate an elevated hematocrit, boot-shaped
        heart with diminished pulmonary vascularity on chest x-ray

    -   Echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and angiocardiography
        all useful in conﬁrming the diagnosis

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

> *Other cyanotic heart diseases:*

-   Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum

-   Tricuspid atresia

-   Hypoplastic left heart syndrome

-   Complete transposition of the great arteries

-   Total anomalous pulmonary venous return

-   Persistent truncus arteriosus

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ##### Treatment

    -   Acute treatment of cyanotic episodes ("tet" spells) includes
        sup- plemental oxygen, placing the patient in the knee-chest
        position; consideration of intravenous propranolol, morphine

    -   Palliation with oral beta-blockers or surgical anastomosis
        between the subclavian and pulmonary artery (Blalock-Taussig
        shunt) rec- ommended for very small infants with severe symptoms
        and in those who are not candidates for complete correction

    -   Surgical correction (closure of ventricular septal defect and
        right ventricular outﬂow tract reconstruction) is the treatment
        of choice in selected patients; patients are still at risk for
        sudden death

####  Urinary Tract Infection 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Girls at higher risk than boys

    -   Circumcision decreases rates of urinary tract infection only
        > during the ﬁrst year of life

    -   Bacterial infection of the urinary tract, deﬁned as \> 10^3^
        colony- forming units/mL by suprapubic aspiration, \> 10^4^
        CFU/mL by catheter, or \> 10^5^ CFU/mL by clean catch

    -   Most common pathogens are *E. coli, Klebsiella,* enterococci,
        > and

> *Proteus mirabilis*

-   Urinalysis usually positive for leukocytes and bacteria

-   Symptoms may be nonspeciﬁc in younger children and infants (eg,
    > intermittent fever, poor feeding, emesis, diarrhea)

-   Difﬁcult to differentiate lower tract infections from pyelonephritis

-   Risk factors include uncircumcised boys (during ﬁrst year of life),
    > female sex, presence of vesicoureteral reﬂux or obstructive uropa-
    > thy, constipation, genitourinary anatomic abnormality

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Appendicitis

    -   Gastroenteritis

    -   Pelvic inﬂammatory disease (adolescents)

    -   Diabetes mellitus

    -   Urethral irritation

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Empiric antibiotics such as penicillins or cephalosporins are
        > ﬁrst- line therapies; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be
        > used in older children

    -   Voiding cystourethrogram for infants and children once free of
        > infection to exclude vesicoureteral reﬂux

    -   Prophylactic antibiotics continued until voiding
        > cystourethrogram performed

####  Wilms' Tumor (Nephroblastoma) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Second most common abdominal tumor in children

    -   Presents between ages 2 and 5 years; occasionally may be seen in
        neonates or adolescents

    -   Occurs sporadically or as part of a malformation syndrome or
        cytogenic abnormality (eg, Beckwith-Wiedemann)

    -   Often discovered incidentally as an asymptomatic abdominal mass;
        occasionally presents with intermittent fever, abdominal pain,
        hematuria

    -   Abdominal ultrasound or CT reveals a solid intrarenal mass;
        5--10% are bilateral

    -   Metastatic lesions in lung often present on chest x-ray

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Neuroblastoma

    -   Rhabdomyosarcoma

    -   Germ cell tumor/teratoma

    -   Lymphoma

    -   Polycystic kidneys

    -   Renal abscess

    -   Hydronephrosis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Once the diagnosis is made, almost all patients undergo surgical
        exploration of the abdomen with attempted excision of the tumor
        and possible nephrectomy

    -   Vincristine, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin are mainstays of
        chemotherapy

    -   Irradiation to sites of known disease prevent recurrence

## Selected Genetic Disorders^∗^

####  Acute Intermittent Porphyria 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Autosomal dominant with variable expressivity and low penetrance

    -   Caused by deﬁciency of porphobilinogen deaminase activity, with
        > increased urinary δ-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen

    -   Unexplained abdominal pain, peripheral or central nervous system
        > dysfunction, psychiatric illness; no skin photosensitivity

    -   Symptoms begin in the teens or twenties, usually in young women

    -   Attacks precipitated by drugs (eg, steroids, sulfonamides,
        > estrogens), infections, reduced caloric intake, smoking,
        > alcohol

    -   Absence of fever and leukocytosis, occasional profound hypona-
        > tremia; port-wine color of urine may be present

    -   Diagnosis conﬁrmed by demonstrating increased porphobilinogen in
        > urine during acute attack

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Other causes of acute abdominal pain

    -   Polyneuropathy due to other causes (eg, Guillain-Barré)

    -   Heavy metal poisoning (eg, lead)

    -   Psychosis and hyponatremia due to other causes

-   ##### Treatment

    -   High-carbohydrate diet may prevent attacks; periodic hepatic
        > imaging to monitor for hepatocellular carcinoma

    -   Flares require stopping exacerbating medications, analgesics,
        > intravenous glucose, and hematin

    -   Closely monitor respiratory status due to bulbar paralysis

####  Alkaptonuria 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Rare, autosomal-recessive disorder with 100% penetrance

    -   Caused by deﬁciency of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase; leads to
        accumulation of an oxidation product in cartilage, large joints,
        and spine

    -   Predominant symptom is often early back and joint pain (in 20-
        and 30-year-olds) with radiographic features consistent with
        spondylitis; joint disease tends to start earlier and progress
        more rapidly in men than women

    -   After age 30, a slight, darkish blue color below the skin in
        areas overlying cartilage such as ears ("ochronosis") develops;
        some have more hyperpigmentation in sclerae and conjunctivae

    -   After age 40, aortic or mitral stenosis due to accumulation of
        metabolites in heart valves; predisposition to coronary artery
        dis- ease occasionally

    -   Renal and prostate stones common

    -   Diagnosed by demonstrating homogentisic acid in the urine, which
        turns black on air exposure (may not occur for several hours
        after voiding)

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Ankylosing spondylitis or other spondyloarthropathies

    -   Osteoarthritis

    -   Amiodarone toxicity

    -   Argyria

    -   Rheumatic heart disease

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Similar to that for other arthropathies

    -   Rigid dietary restriction may be used but of unproven beneﬁt

    -   Cardiac surveillance with echocardiography every 2 years after
        age 40 recommended

####  Alpha~1~-Antitrypsin Deﬁciency 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Common and unrecognized disorder that may lead to chronic
        > obstructive pulmonary disease and severe liver disease

    -   Autosomal recessive, some heterozygotes who smoke have increased
        > risk of respiratory manifestations

    -   Caused by genetic defects in the *PI* gene resulting in
        > deﬁciency (*null* or *S* allele) or entrapment (*Z* allele) of
        > alpha~1~-antitrypsin (AAT), leading to unabated neutrophil
        > elastase damage in the lungs and harmful AAT accumulation in
        > the liver

    -   Basilar predominant panacinar emphysema at age 40--50 in smok-
        > ers or above age 50 in nonsmokers

    -   Liver disease occurs in a subset of patients (*Z* allele) and
        > mani- fests as cirrhosis and ﬁbrosis

    -   Less commonly presents with bronchiectasis, necrotizing panni-
        > culitis, and Wegener's granulomatosis

    -   Low plasma alpha~1~-antitrypsin level followed by conﬁrmatory
        > variant protein phenotype or genetic testing

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Other causes of emphysema or cirrhosis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Diagnostic testing recommended for all patients \< 45 years of
        > age with irreversible airﬂow obstruction, unexplained liver
        > disease, or necrotizing panniculitis; genetic screening of
        > siblings

    -   Smoking cessation and avoidance of passive smoking are crucial

    -   Alpha~1~-antitrypsin augmentation therapy intravenously to slow
        > the decline of lung function; major drawback is exceptional
        > cost, limited efﬁcacy in lung disease; liver dysfunction does
        > not improve with enzyme replacement

    -   Treat manifestations of liver disease, avoid alcohol

    -   Surgical options include lung-volume reduction, lung transplan-
        > tation, and liver transplantation

####  Gaucher's Disease 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Autosomal recessive inheritance with three major clinical sub-
        types; most common in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage

    -   Deﬁciency of beta-glucocerebrosidase causes accumulation of
        sphingolipid within phagocytic cells throughout the body

    -   In type I Gaucher's disease, inﬁltration primarily involves the
        liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes

    -   Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly are common; ero- sion
        of bones due to local infarction with bone pain

    -   Bone marrow aspirates reveal typical "Gaucher cells" (lipid-
        engorged macrophages), with eccentric nucleus, periodic acid-
        Schiff--positive inclusions; elevated serum acid phosphatase

    -   Less common forms of Gaucher's disease, type II and type III,
        involve sphingolipid accumulation in neurologic tissue and lead
        to various neurologic problems

    -   Deﬁnitive diagnosis requires demonstration of deﬁcient gluco-
        cerebrosidase activity in leukocytes

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Other causes of heptosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy

    -   Bone malignancy; avascular necrosis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   First-line management with recombinant form of the enzyme glu-
        cocerebrosidase (imiglucerase); given intravenously on a regular
        basis improves orthopedic and hematologic problems; major draw-
        back is exceptional cost; neurologic abnormalities seen in type
        II and type III disease do not improve with enzyme replacement

    -   For those not responding to enzyme replacement, a glucosylce-
        ramide synthase inhibitor (miglustat) can be used

    -   Bone marrow transplantation can beneﬁt patients with chronic
        neurologic involvement

    -   Splenectomy for those with bleeding problems due to platelet
        sequestration

-   ##### Pearl

####  Hemochromatosis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   The most common genetic disease among white North Americans

    -   Autosomal-recessive inheritance caused by *C282Y* mutation

    -   Low penetrance of iron-overload--related disease, affecting
        > approximately 28% male and only 1% female homozygotes

    -   Hyperabsorption of iron and its parenchymal storage results in
        > tissue injury with symptoms and signs of hepatic, pancreatic,
        > car- diac, articular, and gonadal dysfunction

    -   Symptoms typically occur between age 40 and 60 years in men and
        > after menopause in women; depend on affected organs

    -   Clinical manifestations may include cirrhosis, hepatocellular
        > carci- noma, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, arthropathy,
        > hypopituitarism

    -   Elevated serum iron, normal transferrin, percentage saturation
        > of iron \> 50%, and increased ferritin

    -   Liver biopsy characteristic, with iron stain identifying accumu-
        > lation in parenchymal cells

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Other causes of cirrhosis or heart failure or hypopituitarism

    -   Other causes of iron overload, especially multiple transfusions
        > (\> 100 units) as in homozygous beta-thalassemia or sickle
        > cell disease

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Genetic screening recommended for all ﬁrst-order relatives

    -   Early recognition and diagnosis (precirrhotic state) is crucial

    -   Low-iron diet; avoid uncooked seafood due to increased suscep-
        > tibility to bacterial infection; avoid alcohol

    -   Weekly phlebotomy to deplete iron stores, followed by
        > maintenance phlebotomy or intramuscular deferoxamine, is
        > usually indicated

    -   Liver transplantation for decompensated cirrhosis

####  Homocystinuria 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Autosomal-recessive disorder with variable expressivity that can
        manifest in infancy or adulthood

    -   Caused by cystathionine β-synthase deﬁciency resulting in
        extreme elevations of plasma and urinary homocystine levels and
        is characterized by involvement of the eye, skeletal system,
        vas- cular system, and central nervous system

    -   Patients often present in second and third decades of life with
        evidence of arterial or venous thromboses without underlying
        risk factors for hypercoagulability

    -   Repeated venous and arterial thromboses common; reduced life
        expectancy from myocardial infarction, stroke, and pulmonary
        embolism

    -   Ectopia lentis almost always present; mental retardation and
        asthenic habitus common

    -   Diagnosis established by extremely elevated plasma and urinary
        homocystine levels

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Marfan's syndrome

    -   Other causes of mental retardation

    -   Other causes of hypercoagulability

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Treatment in infancy with pyridoxine and folate helps some

    -   Pyridoxine nonresponders treated with dietary reduction in
        methionine and supplementation of cysteine, also from infancy

    -   Betaine may also be useful

    -   Surgery for ectopia lentis

    -   Anticoagulation as appropriate for thrombosis

####  Marfan's Syndrome 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Autosomal-dominant disorder; 25% de novo gene mutation

    -   A systemic connective tissue disease due to mutations in the ﬁb-
        > rillin gene; characterized by abnormalities of the skeletal
        > system, eye, cardiovascular system

    -   Spontaneous pneumothorax, ectopia lentis, myopia are charac-
        > teristic; patients are tall with long extremities and
        > arachnodactyly, thoracic deformity, and joint laxity

    -   Aortic dilation and dissection most feared complication; mitral
        > valve prolapse seen 85%; mitral regurgitation in some

    -   Clinical diagnosis based on family history and observation of
        > characteristic ﬁndings in multiple organ systems

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Homocystinuria; Ehler's-Danlos syndrome; Klinefelter's syn-
        > drome; Fragile X syndrome

    -   Aortic dissection due to other causes

    -   Mitral or aortic regurgitation due to other causes

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Patients of all ages require echocardiography---often
        > annually--- to monitor aortic diameter and mitral valve
        > function

    -   Endocarditis prophylaxis required

    -   Beta-blockade may retard the rate of aortic dilation; vigorous
        > exercise avoidance protects some from aortic dissection

    -   Replacement of aortic root recommended when diameter exceeds 50
        > mm (normal is less than 40 mm), or rate of increase approaches
        > 10 mm/year

    -   Most untreated patients die in their fourth or ﬁfth decade from
        > dis- section or heart failure (due to aortic regurgitation);
        > with treatment, life expectancy approximates that of the
        > general population

####  Neuroﬁbromatosis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Sporadic or autosomal dominant with variable expressivity

    -   Two genetically and clinically distinct forms: Type 1 (von
        Recklinghausen's disease), more common and characterized by
        multiple hyperpigmented macules and neuroﬁbromas; type 2,
        characterized by eighth cranial nerve tumors and occasionally
        other intracranial or intraspinal tumors

    -   Type 1 associated with cutaneous lesions (neuroﬁbromas), axil-
        lary freckling, iris hamartomas (Lisch's nodules), and patches
        of cutaneous pigmentation (café au lait spots) that begin in
        childhood; ocular gliomas may occur

    -   In adolescence and adulthood, malignant degeneration of neu-
        roﬁbromas possible, leading to peripheral sarcoma (neuroﬁ-
        brosarcomas); also associated with meningioma, bone cysts,
        pheochromocytomas, and scoliosis

    -   Type 2 often presents in early adulthood with symptoms and signs
        of tumor of the spinal or cranial nerves, most commonly
        bilateral vestibular schwannomas; tumors usually not malignant
        but delicate anatomical location and high tumor burden lead to
        early mortality

    -   Clinical criteria for diagnosis in both type 1 and type 2

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Intracranial or intraspinal tumor due to other causes

    -   McCune-Albright syndrome

    -   Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Genetic counseling important

    -   Disﬁgurement may be corrected by plastic surgery

    -   Intraspinal or intracranial tumors and tumors of peripheral
        nerves treated surgically if symptomatic

####  Wilson's Disease (Hepatolenticular Degeneration) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Rare autosomal-recessive disorder with variable onset between
        > ﬁrst and sixth decades; genetic defect in copper-transporting
        > enzyme (P-type ATPase) prevents copper excretion into bile
        > result- ing in excessive copper deposition in liver and brain

    -   Genetic defect in copper-transporting enzyme (P-type ATPase)
        > prevents copper excretion into the bile and results in
        > excessive dep- osition of copper in the liver and brain

    -   Presentation usually includes symptoms of hepatic and/or
        > neuropsy- chiatric dysfunction including cirrhosis, jaundice,
        > liver failure, and basal ganglia dysfunction

    -   Kayser-Fleischer rings in the cornea (in almost all cases of
        > neu- rologic Wilson's disease), hepatomegaly, parkinsonian
        > tremor and rigidity, psychiatric abnormalities

    -   Diagnosis based on biochemical tests often followed by
        > conﬁrmatory genetic testing of the *ATP7B* gene: Elevated
        > urinary copper excretion (\> 100 μg/24 h), elevated hepatic
        > copper concentration (\> 250 μg/g of dry liver), decreased
        > serum ceruloplasmin (\< 20 μg/dL)

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Other causes of liver dysfunction

    -   Other causes of psychiatric and neurologic disturbances,
        > especially Parkinson's disease

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Early treatment to remove excess copper crucial; in asympto-
        > matic patients, oral zinc acetate promotes fecal copper
        > excretion

    -   Restrict dietary copper (shellﬁsh, organ foods, legumes)

    -   For symptomatic patients, oral copper chelation with penicil-
        > lamine or trientine facilitates urinary excretion of chelated
        > copper; pyridoxine supplementation necessary

    -   Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate promising as initial therapy for
        > neurologic Wilson's disease

    -   Liver transplantation liver failure, intractable neurologic
        > disease

    -   Family members (especially siblings) require screening tests

## Common Disorders of the Eye

####  Acute Conjunctivitis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Acute onset of red, itchy, burning eyes with tearing, eyelid
        crust- ing, foreign body sensation, and discharge

    -   Conjunctival injection and edema, mucoid or purulent discharge,
        lid edema, and possible preauricular lymph node enlargement

    -   Vision may be normal or slightly decreased

    -   Causes include bacterial and viral (including herpetic)
        infections and allergy

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Acute anterior uveitis

    -   Acute angle-closure glaucoma

    -   Corneal abrasion or infection

    -   Dacryocystitis

    -   Nasolacrimal duct obstruction

    -   Chronic conjunctivitis

    -   Scleritis in autoimmune disease

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Topical broad-spectrum ophthalmic antibiotic (eg, ﬂuoro-
        quinolone), cool compresses, artiﬁcial tears

    -   Ophthalmology follow-up for persistent symptoms or decreased
        visual acuity

####  Acute (Angle-Closure) Glaucoma 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Less than 5% of all glaucoma

    -   Acute onset of eye pain and redness, photophobia, blurred vision
        > with colored halos around lights, headaches, nausea, or
        > abdomi- nal pain

    -   Decreased vision, conjunctival injection, steamy cornea, mid-
        > dilated and nonreactive pupil, and elevated intraocular
        > pressure by tonometry

    -   Preexisting narrow anterior chamber angle predisposes; older
        > patients, hyperopes, Asians, and Inuits more susceptible

    -   Precipitated by pupillary dilation caused by stress, pharmaco-
        > logic mydriasis, dark environment (eg, movie theater)

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Acute conjunctivitis

    -   Acute anterior uveitis

    -   Corneal abrasion or infection

    -   Other types of glaucoma

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Prompt ophthalmologic referral

    -   Pharmacotherapy includes: Topical beta-blocker (timolol), alpha-
        > agonist (brimonidine), carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (dorzo-
        > lamide); if elevated intraocular pressure does not respond to
        > topical therapy, systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
        > (acetazolamide) or hyperosmotic agent (eg, glycerol or
        > mannitol)

    -   Laser peripheral iridotomy usually curative

    -   Micronutrient supplementation with Age Related Eye Disease Study
        formulation (eg, Preservision AREDS) slows progression in
        patients with moderate to severe dry AMD

    -   Intravitreal injection of antiangiogenesis drugs (eg, Lucentis
        or Avastin) by a retina specialist has become the standard of
        care for wet AMD

####  Preseptal Cellulitis 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Inflammation and infection confined to the eyelids and peri-
        orbital structures anterior to the orbital septum; the globe is
        typically uninvolved

    -   In children, underlying sinusitis is often the cause. In adults,
        trauma or a cutaneous source (eg, infected chalazion) is more
        typical

    -   Eyelid pain, tenderness, redness, warmth and swelling

    -   Visual acuity is unaffected, and there is *no* proptosis or
        restriction of eye motility

    -   CT scan can distinguish from orbital cellulitis, detect
        sinusitis, and exclude other causes

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Orbital cellulitis

    -   Insect or animal bite

    -   Retained foreign body

    -   Allergic reaction

    -   Inﬂammatory orbital pseudotumor

####  Retinal Detachment 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Risk factors include lattice vitreoretinal degeneration,
        posterior vitreous separation (especially with vitreous
        hemorrhage), high myopia, trauma, and previous ocular surgery
        (especially with vit- reous loss)

    -   Acute onset of photopsias (ﬂashes of light), ﬂoaters
        ("cobwebs"), or shadow ("curtain") across the visual ﬁeld, with
        peripheral or central visual loss

    -   Elevation of the retina with a ﬂap tear or break in the retina,
        vit- reous pigmented cells or hemorrhage seen by ophthalmoscopy

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Retinoschisis

    -   Choroidal detachment

    -   Posterior vitreous separation

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Immediate ophthalmologic referral

    -   Repair of small tears by laser photocoagulation or cryopexy

    -   Repair of retinal detachment by pneumatic retinopexy, scleral
        buckling, pars plana vitrectomy with drainage of subretinal
        ﬂuid, endolaser, cryopexy, gas or silicone oil injection

-   ##### Pearl

> *Beware of ﬂashers, ﬂoaters and visual ﬁeld abnormalities in any
> patient with marked myopia and a history of eye trauma. This is a
> retinal detach- ment until proven otherwise.*

####  Subconjunctival Hemorrhage 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Acute painless onset of bright red blood in the white part of
        the eye; striking appearance, but painless with minimal to no
        effect on vision

    -   Most often occurs in patients on aspirin or anticoagulation who
        have a recent history of severe coughing, sneezing, heavy
        lifting, or constipation (Valsalva)

        purulent discharge

    -   Usually caused by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus
        aureus,* or fungi (*Candida, Aspergillus*)

    -   Movement of the auricle and tragus elicits pain; erythema and
        edema of the ear canal with a purulent exudate on examination

    -   Tympanic membrane (TM) is red but moves normally with pneu-
        matic otoscopy, but often not seen due to ear canal edema

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Malignant otitis externa (external otitis in an immunocompro-
        mised or diabetic patient, or one with osteomyelitis of the tem-
        poral bone); *Pseudomonas* causative in diabetes

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Prevent additional moisture and mechanical injury to the ear
        canal

    -   Otic drops containing a mixture of an aminoglycoside or
        quinolones as well as a corticosteroid

    -   Purulent debris ﬁlling the canal should be removed; occasion-
        ally, a wick is needed to facilitate entry of the otic drops

    -   Analgesics

    -   Mufﬂed voice, toxic-appearing and febrile patient; patients may
        present in a "snifﬁng" position

    -   Unlike in children, indirect laryngoscopy is generally safe to
        per- form in adults

    -   Should be suspected when odynophagia is out of proportion to
        oropharyngeal ﬁndings

    -   *Haemophilus inﬂuenzae* type B was historically the most common

        > hypertension, anticoagulation, inhaled drug use, and
        > hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   In recurrent and/or persistent cases, consider endoscopic exami-
        > nation to evaluate for nasal masses or mucosal disease that
        > may result in repeated bleeding episodes

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Treat underlying causes (ie, control blood pressure if
        > hypertensive)

    -   Direct pressure to nares continuously for 15 minutes

    -   Topical nasal decongestant spray (phenylephrine, oxymetazoline,
        > Neo-Synephrine)

    -   If visible, bleeding site can be cauterized with silver nitrate

    -   If bleeding continues despite pressure, nasal packing should be
        > placed (gauze ribbon, compressed sponge, epistaxis balloon
        > catheter)

    -   Posterior epistaxis balloons generally have separate anterior
        > and posterior balloons

    -   Endovascular embolization and surgical cauterization and/or
        > vessel ligation are considerations for refractory persistent
        > bleeding

## Poisoning

####  Acetaminophen (Tylenol; Many Others) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Most widely used antipyretic/analgesic makes it the most common
        > cause of acute hepatic failure in the United States

    -   First 24 hours: May be asymptomatic or have generalized malaise

    -   24--48 hours: Increased transaminases, right upper quadrant
        > pain, vomiting

    -   72--96 hours: Enzymes peak, hepatic failure, encephalopathy,
        > renal failure possible

    -   4 days--3 weeks: Resolution of symptoms (if they survive)

    -   Toxic dose: 150 mg/kg (children) or 7.5 g (adults)

    -   Peak levels occur 30--60 minutes after ingestion

    -   Measure serum acetaminophen level 4 hours postingestion

    -   Plot on nomogram and treat if level above lower limit (\> 150
        > μg/mL); if lab units in milligrams per deciliter, multiply by
        > 10

    -   Detectable serum acetaminophen level or elevated transaminases
        > require treatment if presentation after 24 hours

    -   Patients may not realize that combination analgesics (eg,
        > Percocet, Vicodin, Darvocet) contain acetaminophen

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Viral hepatitis, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Activated charcoal with N-acetylcysteine (NAC; see below)

    -   Gastric lavage if less than 1 hour since ingestion or large
        ingestion

    -   NAC: repeat dose of NAC if vomited within 1 hour of
        administration

    -   If given within 8 hours of ingestion, NAC nearly 100% protective

    -   Intravenous NAC may be given when oral route not possible

####  Amphetamines, Ecstasy, Cocaine 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Sympathomimetic clinical scenario: Anxiety, tremulousness, agi-
        tation, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, dilated pupils,
        mus- cular hyperactivity, hyperthermia

    -   Psychosis and seizures can occur, 2--6 hours postingestion if
        severe

    -   Metabolic acidosis may occur

    -   With cocaine in particular, hemorrhagic stroke and myocardial
        infarction

    -   Ecstasy (MDMA) associated with serotonin syndrome (see anti-
        depressants), hyponatremia, and malignant hyperthermia

    -   Obtain rectal temperature

    -   Studies include glucose, chemistry panel, renal panel,
        urinalysis, ECG, cardiac monitoring, prothrombin time (PT)
        /partial throm- boplastin time (PTT)

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Anticholinergic poisoning

    -   Functional psychosis

    -   Heat stroke

    -   Other stimulant overdose (eg, ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine)

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Activated charcoal for oral ingestions if airway is protected or
        secure; may not be effective because most are rapidly absorbed

    -   Gastric lavage if less than 1 hour since ingestion

    -   For agitation or psychosis: Sedation with benzodiazepines may
        need large doses; titrate rapidly in ﬁrst 30 minutes;
        neuroleptics lower seizure threshold and may worsen the clinical
        outcome

    -   For hyperthermia: Remove clothing, cool mist spray, cooling
        blan- ket, benzodiazepines for muscle rigidity

    -   For hypertension: Benzodiazepines; if refractory, start
        nitroprus- side infusion; avoid beta-blockers, as they may
        worsen hyperten- sion due to unopposed alpha stimulation

    -   For chest pain: Benzodiazepines, aspirin, nitroglycerin; give
        mor- phine if not responsive

    -   Contained in antihistamines, antipsychotics, antispasmodics,
        > bel- ladonna alkaloids, cyclic antidepressants, mushrooms, and
        > some plants

    -   Anticholinergic toxidrome: "Hot as Hades" (hyperthermia), "blind
        > as a bat" (mydriasis), "dry as a bone" (dry mucous membranes,
        > thirst), "red as a beet" (ﬂushed, dry skin), and "mad as a
        > hatter" (agitation)

    -   Also can see myoclonus, decreased gut motility, distended blad-
        > der, seizures

    -   Prolonged QT interval and torsade de pointes with nonsedating
        > antihistamines

    -   Useful studies include electrolyte panel, creatinine, calcium,
        > glu- cose, urinalysis, creatinine kinase, and ECG

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Sympathomimetic overdose

    -   LSD or other hallucinogen ingestion

    -   Delirium tremens, acute psychosis

    -   Hyperthyroidism

    -   Jimsonweed or other ingestion of an anticholinergic-containing
        > plant

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Single-dose activated charcoal (repeated doses may cause abdom-
        > inal distention)

    -   Consider gastric lavage if less than 1 hour since ingestion

    -   In those with hyperthermia, benzodiazepines, cooling fan, ice
        > water bath, intravenous hydration

    -   Despite being the reversal agent, the use of physostigmine is
        > con- troversial and limited to severe symptomatology
        > (tachycardia with hypotension, repeat seizures, severe
        > agitation or seizures) as it can cause asystole; it is

####  Antidepressants: Atypical Agents (Serotonin Syndrome) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Trazodone, bupropion, venlafaxine, and the SSRIs (ﬂuoxetine,
        sertraline, paroxetine, ﬂuvoxamine, escitalopram, citalopram);
        well-tolerated in pure overdoses, high toxic:therapeutic ratios

    -   Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision, sinus tachycardia;
        citalopram may cause ECG changes

    -   Serotonin syndrome (by overdose or interaction with other med-
        ications): Mental status changes, agitation, autonomic
        instability, myoclonus, hyperreﬂexia, diaphoresis, tremor,
        diarrhea, incoor- dination, fever

    -   Useful studies include ECG, chemistry panel, urinalysis

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Alcohol withdrawal

    -   Heatstroke

    -   Hypoglycemia, hyperthyroidism

    -   Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Activated charcoal

    -   Gastric lavage if less than 1 hour since large ingestion or if a
        mixed drug ingestion

    -   In those with hyperthermia, aggressive cooling, intravenous
        ﬂuids, and benzodiazepines useful

    -   Cardiac monitoring and ECG based on speciﬁc agent (eg,
        citalopram)

    -   Benzodiazepines initially; bupropion, venlafaxine, and SSRIs
        associated with seizures

    -   Serotonin syndrome typically self-limited within 24--36 hours;
        stop all offending agents

    -   Cyproheptadine (an antiserotonergic agent) in serotonin syn-
        drome has unproven beneﬁt; consider only after cooling and
        sedation initiated

####  Antidepressants: Tricyclics 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Hypotension, tachydysrhythmia, and seizures are the most life-
        > threatening presentation and develop within 2 hours of
        > ingestion; other symptoms due to anticholinergic effects

    -   Peripheral antimuscarinic: Dry mouth, dry skin, muscle
        > twitching, decreased bowel activity, dilated pupils

    -   Central antimuscarinic: Agitation, delirium, confusion,
        > hallucina- tions, slurred speech, ataxia, sedation, coma

    -   Cardiac: QRS-interval widening, large R-wave in aVR, terminal
        > right axis deviation, prolonged QTc interval, sinus
        > tachycardia

    -   Generalized seizures from GABA~A~-receptor antagonism

    -   Toxicity can occur at therapeutic doses in combination with
        > other drugs (antihistamines, antipsychotics)

    -   Useful studies include ECG and telemetric monitoring, chem-
        > istry panel, renal panel, glucose, urinalysis, qualitative
        > tricyclic determination, complete blood count

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Other drug ingestions: Carbamazepine, antihistamines, class Ia
        > and Ic antiarrhythmics, propranolol, lithium, cocaine

    -   Hyperkalemia

    -   Hypocalcemia

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Activated charcoal

    -   Gastric lavage if less than 1 hour since ingestion

    -   Alkalinize serum with sodium bicarbonate for QRS \> 100 mil-
        > liseconds, refractory hypotension, or ventricular dysrhythmia
        > (to reach goal serum pH 7.50--7.55)

    -   Seizures usually respond to benzodiazepines; phenytoin not rec-

####  Arsenic 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Symptoms appear within 1 hour after ingestion but may last as
        long as 12 hours

    -   Symptoms depend on amount, time, and form ingested

    -   A garlic smell may be noticed on breath or from body ﬂuids

    -   Acute ingestion: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
        dysrhythmias, hypotension, seizures

    -   Acute hemolytic anemia may develop, leading to hemoglobinuria

    -   Chronic ingestion: Headache, encephalopathy, dermatitis, neu-
        ropathy, peripheral edema, leukopenia

    -   Useful studies include abdominal x-ray (may demonstrate metal-
        lic ingestion), spot urine for arsenic, complete blood count
        (basophilic stippling of red cells), renal panel, liver panel,
        uri- nalysis, 24-hour urine, ECG

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Gastroenteritis

    -   Septic shock

    -   Other heavy metal toxicities, including thallium, iron, lead,
        and mercury

    -   Other peripheral neuropathies, including Guillain-Barré syndrome

    -   Addison's disease

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Intravenous ﬂuids and vasopressors, if necessary, for
        hypotension

    -   Dysrhythmias: Lidocaine or deﬁbrillation for ventricular tachy-
        cardia; intravenous magnesium or isoproterenol, overdrive pacing
        for torsade de pointes

    -   Benzodiazepines for seizures

    -   Chelation therapy should begin as soon as acute arsenic toxicity
        is suspected

    -   If radiopaque material visible on abdominal ﬁlms, bowel
        decontam- ination recommended (gastric lavage followed by
        activated charcoal followed by whole-bowel irrigation until
        abdominal ﬁlms are clear)

####  Benzodiazepines 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Primarily CNS effects, including drowsiness, slurred speech,
        > con- fusion, ataxia, respiratory depression, hypotension, coma

    -   Isolated benzodiazepine ingestion rarely results in death; mixed
        > ingestions (alcohol, narcotics, other sedatives) increase

    -   Toxic alcohols

    -   Opioid ingestion

    -   Metabolic encephalopathy

    -   Encephalitis, meningitis, other medical diseases of the CNS

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Patients who are unresponsive or confused should receive dex-
        > trose, thiamine, and naloxone

    -   Respiratory depression should be monitored closely; intubate if
        > necessary

####  Beta-Blockers 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Hypotension, bradycardia, atrioventricular block, cardiogenic
        shock, torsade de pointes (due to sotalol)

    -   Altered mental status, psychosis, seizures, and coma, most often
        in the setting of hypotension and hypoglycemia, but may also
        occur with propranolol and other lipophilic agents

    -   Onset of symptoms typically within 2 hours of overdose

    -   Useful studies include ECG (bradycardia, prolonged PR interval,
        AV block, widened QRS interval), serum digoxin level, chemistry
        panel

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Calcium antagonist and digitalis overdose

    -   Cardiogenic shock

    -   Tricyclic antidepressant toxicity

    -   Cholinergic toxicity

-   ##### Treatment

    -   If endotracheal intubation or gastric lavage required, pretreat
        with atropine to limit vagal stimulation

    -   Gastric lavage is recommended for large overdoses, provided the
        patient presents within 1 hour of ingestion (even if
        asymptomatic)

    -   Multidose activated charcoal for sustained-release preparations

    -   Supportive therapy for bradycardia and hypotension, including
        crystalloid infusion and atropine

    -   Administration of glucagon can be diagnostic and therapeutic

    -   If the above fails, then epinephrine, isoproterenol, or
        dobutamine infusion, aortic balloon pump

    -   High-dose insulin with glucose therapy effective in refractory
        cases of beta-blocker overdose

####  Calcium Antagonists (Calcium Channel Blockers) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Bradycardia, hypotension, atrioventricular block, hyperglycemia

    -   Cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest leading to pulmonary edema

    -   Decreased cerebral perfusion leads to confusion or agitation,
        > dizziness, lethargy, seizures

    -   Useful studies include ECG, serum digoxin level, chemistry
        > panel, and ionized calcium

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Beta-blocker or digitalis toxicity

    -   Tricyclic antidepressant toxicity

    -   Acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock

    -   Hypotensive, bradycardic shock typically distinct from hyperdy-
        > namic shock of hypovolemia or sepsis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Gastric lavage often used

    -   Activated charcoal if airway is protected and/or secure

    -   Whole-bowel irrigation for sustained-release preparations

    -   Supportive therapy for coma, hypotension, and seizures

    -   To combat cardiotoxic effects: Fluid boluses and atropine

    -   Calcium chloride is the reversal agent if refractory

    -   Glucagon bolus: 2--5 mg over 60 seconds, repeat up to total of
        > 10 mg; then begin intravenous infusion

####  Carbon Monoxide 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   May result from exposure to any incomplete combustion of any
        carbonaceous fossil fuel (eg, automobile exhaust, smoke inhala-
        tion, improperly vented gas heater)

    -   Causes tissue hypoxia and thus affects the organs with highest
        oxygen demand (heart, brain)

    -   Symptoms nonspeciﬁc and ﬂulike: Fatigue, headache, dizziness,
        abdominal pain, nausea, confusion

    -   With more severe intoxication, lethargy, syncope, seizures, coma

    -   Secondary injury from ischemia: Myocardial infarction, rhab-
        domyolysis, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, retinal hemor-
        rhages, neurologic deﬁcits

    -   Survivors of severe poisoning may have permanent neurologic
        deﬁcits

    -   Useful studies include carboxyhemoglobin level (can be venous),
        ECG, chemistry panel, renal panel, arterial blood gas; pulse
        oximetry can be falsely normal

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Cyanide poisoning; depressant drug ingestion

    -   Acute coronary syndrome; meningitis; encephalitis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Remove from exposure

    -   Maintain airway and assist ventilation; intubation may be
        necessary

    -   100% oxygen by nonrebreathing facemask decreases carboxyhe-
        moglobin half-life to 80 minutes from 4--6 hours

    -   Hyperbaric oxygen (decreases carboxyhemoglobin half-life to 20
        minutes) considered in patients with syncope, coma, seizures,
        Glasgow Coma Scale score \< 15, myocardial ischemia, ventric-
        ular dysrhythmias, neurologic deﬁcits or persistent headache,

####  Cardiac Glycosides (Digitalis) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Accidental ingestion, common in children

    -   May be due to plant ingestions: Oleander, foxglove, lily of the
        > valley, red squill, dogbane

    -   Age, coexisting disease, electrolyte disturbance (hypokalemia,
        > hypo- magnesemia, hypercalcemia), hypoxemia, and other cardiac
        > med- ications (including diuretics) increase potential for

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker toxicity

    -   Tricyclic antidepressant ingestion

    -   Clonidine overdose

    -   Organophosphate insecticide poisoning

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Activated charcoal; multiple doses may be required due to
        > entero- hepatic circulation of digoxin

    -   Gastric lavage if less than 1 hour since ingestion

    -   Maintain adequate airway and assist ventilation as necessary

    -   Correct hypomagnesemia, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, hyperkalemia or

####  Cyanide 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Laboratory or industrial exposure (plastics, solvents, glues,
        fab- rics), smoke inhalation in ﬁres

    -   Byproduct of the breakdown of nitroprusside, ingestion of
        cyanogenic glycosides in some plant products (apricot pits,
        bitter almonds)

    -   Absorbed rapidly by inhalation, through skin, or
        gastrointestinally

    -   Symptoms shortly after inhalation or ingestion; some compounds
        (acetonitrile, a cosmetic nail remover) metabolize to hydrogen
        cyanide, and symptoms may be delayed

    -   Dose-dependent toxicity; headache, dyspnea, anxiety, nausea,
        confusion, bradycardia, hypotension, shock, seizures, death

    -   Disrupts the ability of tissues to use oxygen; picture mimics
        hypoxia, including profound lactic acidosis

    -   High oxygen saturation of venous blood; retinal vessels bright
        red

    -   Odor of bitter almonds on patient's breath or vomitus only
        sensed by 40% of population

    -   Useful studies include: Chemistry panel, renal panel, serum glu-
        cose, arterial blood gas, serum lactate level

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Carbon monoxide or hydrogen sulﬁde poisoning

    -   Methemoglobinemia; acute coronary syndrome

    -   Other sources of acidosis in suspected ingestion: Methanol, eth-
        ylene glycol, salicylates, iron, metformin

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Remove patient from the source of exposure, decontaminate skin,
        100% oxygen by face mask, intravenous ﬂuid, cardiac monitoring

    -   For ingestion, activated charcoal

    -   Inhaled amyl nitrite or intravenous sodium nitrite plus sodium
        thiosulfate antidote; nitrites may exacerbate hypotension or
        cause massive methemoglobinemia

    -   In case of ﬁre exposure, consider thiosulfate alone, as methemo-
        globinemia and carbon monoxide may cause reduced oxygen-
        carrying capacity

####  Ethanol (Alcohol) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Slurred speech, nystagmus, decreased motor coordination, respi-
        > ratory depression

    -   With the development of tolerance, blood alcohol levels
        > correlate poorly with degree of intoxication

    -   Most common cause of an osmolar gap (signiﬁcant acidosis, how-
        > ever, should not be assumed due to ethanol alone)

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Other alcohol ingestion (methanol, isopropanol)

    -   Benzodiazepine ingestion

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Supportive care including intubation for airway protection if
        > indicated

    -   Gastric lavage indicated only for massive ingestion within 30
        > minutes

    -   Bedside glucose check or empiric dextrose, thiamine, folate

    -   Examination to evaluate for injuries or illness; check for
        > hypothermia

    -   Serial observation until clinically sober; consider other causes
        > if further deterioration in mental status

    -   Assessment and referral to treatment programs are appropriate
        > when the patient is sober; referral to primary health care and
        > serv- ices for housing, food, and jobs may also be appropriate

####  Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   An endogenous metabolite of GABA that is easily made at home,
        GHB is used recreationally and in involuntary intoxication (eg,
        date rape); it has no clinical use in the United States

    -   Has been used as an anesthetic, in the treatment of alcohol
        with- drawal, and as an adjunctive agent for body builders

    -   An odorless, colorless, nearly tasteless liquid, powder, or
        capsule

    -   Dose-related response; euphoria, nystagmus, clonic jerking, mild
        hypothermia, bradycardia, nausea, vomiting, respiratory depres-
        sion, coma, and seizures may occur

    -   Clinical clues include abrupt onset of uncharacteristic
        aggressive behavior with rapidly following drowsiness and marked
        agita- tion on stimulation despite prolonged apnea and hypoxia

    -   May be detectable in urine by mass spectrometry for up to 12
        hours; may generate U waves on ECG

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Ethanol or other alcohol intoxication

    -   Opioid ingestion

    -   Other sedative-hypnotic ingestion (benzodiazepines, chloral
        hydrate, methaqualone)

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Consider gastric lavage and activated charcoal; may be of
        limited value in small ingestions and due to rapid absorption

    -   Supportive care including intubation if needed for airway stabi-
        lization or respiratory assistance

    -   Check for mixed ingestion of alcohol or other agents

    -   Consider arterial blood gas and head CT in comatose patient with
        unreliable history

    -   Patient counseling and evidence collection in the setting of
        rape or assault; drug testing is also appropriate in this
        setting

####  Iron 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Five clinical stages of acute iron toxicity occur: (1) local GI
        > toxicity (within 6 hours), (2) latent (6--24 hours after
        > inges- tion), (3) systemic toxicity (12--48 hours after
        > ingestion), (4) hepatic failure (2--3 days), (5) gastric
        > outlet obstruction (2--8 weeks)

    -   Initially, GI irritation results in vomiting, diarrhea,
        > abdominal pain, mucosal ulceration, and bleeding (hematemesis,
        > melena)

    -   Systemic effects begin with disruption of cellular metabolism
        > resulting in acidosis, lethargy, hyperventilation, seizures,
        > coma, coagulopathy, and hypovolemic shock

    -   Elevated serum iron levels correlate somewhat with toxicity, but
        > falsely low levels may occur due to variable absorption rates
        > and the presence of deferoxamine

    -   Radiopaque tablets may be visible on plain abdominal radi-
        > ographs; negative radiographs do not exclude iron ingestion
        > (common children's chewables are not radiopaque)

    -   In addition to serum iron levels, useful studies include blood
        > count, abdominal x-ray, chemistry and renal panel, PT/PTT,
        > serum glucose, blood gas, and type and screen

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Arsenic, copper salt, mercurial salt poisoning

    -   Salicylate, theophylline, or acetaminophen overdose

    -   Infectious gastroenteritis, appendicitis, sepsis

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Consider GI lavage early after ingestion or if pill fragments
        > still in stomach on abdominal x-ray

    -   Whole-bowel irrigation; endoscopic or surgical removal may be
        > appropriate for large iron loads

    -   Aggressive intravenous ﬂuid and pressor support; correct coagu-
        > lopathy with vitamin K and fresh-frozen plasma

    -   Chelation therapy with deferoxamine for anyone with toxic
        > appearance and/or a very high serum iron level

####  Isoniazid (INH) 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Symptoms usually begin within 2 hours of ingestion with vomit-
        ing and photophobia

    -   Common triad: Profound metabolic acidosis, persistent coma,
        refractory seizures

    -   Hyperglycemia commonly occurs and may mimic DKA

    -   Chronic therapeutic use results in peripheral neuritis,
        tinnitus, hepatitis, memory impairment, and hypersensitivity
        reactions

    -   Hepatic failure the most dangerous adverse reaction to chronic
        use

    -   Substantial genetic variability in the rate at which people
        metab- olize INH; about half of US population are slow
        metabolizers

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Salicylate, cyanide, carbon monoxide, or anticholinergic
        overdose

    -   In the patient with seizures, acidosis, and coma, consider
        sepsis, meningitis, encephalitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, head
        trauma

    -   Hepatitis due to other cause

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Gastric lavage and activated charcoal for large ingestion within
        2 hours

    -   Pyridoxine (vitamin B~6~) is the reversal agent: 1 g for each
        gram of INH ingested; 5 g slow intravenous empiric dose will
        stop seizures and thus correct acidosis

    -   Benzodiazepines as adjunct in seizure control, but will not work
        if used as sole agent

    -   Supportive therapy for coma, hypotension

-   ##### Pearl

> *Ten to twenty percent of patients using INH for treatment of

####  Lead 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Results from chronic exposure; sources include solder,
        > batteries, paint (in homes built before 1970)

    -   Symptoms and signs include colicky abdominal pain, gum lead
        > line, constipation, headache, irritability, neuropathy,
        > learning dis- orders in children, episodes of gout (saturnine
        > gout)

    -   Ataxia, confusion, obtundation, seizures

    -   Useful studies include complete blood count, chemistry panel,
        > renal panel, lead level, abdominal x-ray, long bone
        > radiographs (looking for lead lines)

    -   Blood lead \> 10 μg/dL toxic, \> 70 mg/dL severe

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Other heavy metal toxicity (arsenic, mercury)

    -   Tricyclic antidepressant, anticholinergic, ethylene glycol, or
        > carbon monoxide exposure

    -   Other sources of encephalopathy: Alcohol withdrawal, sedative-
        > hypnotic medications, meningitis, encephalitis, hypoglycemia

    -   Medical causes of acute abdomen (eg, porphyria, sickle cell
        > crisis)

    -   For chronic toxicity: Depression, iron deﬁciency anemia,
        > learning disability

    -   Idiopathic gout

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Airway protection and ventilatory assistance as indicated; sup-
        > portive therapy for coma and seizures

    -   Lavage for acute ingestion; whole-bowel irrigation, endoscopy,
        > or surgical removal if a large lead-containing object is
        > visible on abdominal radiograph

    -   Chelation therapy based on clinical presentation and blood lead

####  Lithium 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Acute ingestion (high serum, low tissue burden): Dystonia,
        ataxia, tremor, hyperreﬂexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
        cramping

    -   Chronic ingestion (high tissue \[ie, neurologic\] burden):
        Confusion, which may progress to seizures and/or coma if
        unrecognized and patient continues lithium ingestion

    -   Ventricular dysrhythmia, sinus arrest, asystole, sinus
        bradycardia, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus

    -   Elevated serum lithium levels (\> 1.5 mEq/L); acute ingestions
        lead to higher serum levels than chronic overdose

    -   U waves, ﬂattened or inverted T waves, ST depression may be seen
        on ECG

    -   Multiple medications increase the risk of lithium toxicity
        (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, loop diuretics,
        NSAIDs, phenothiazines), as do renal failure, volume depletion,
        gastroenteritis, and decreased sodium intake

    -   Useful studies: Chemistry panel (a decreased anion gap may be
        seen), renal panel, urinalysis, ECG

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Neurologic disease (cerebrovascular accident, postictal state,
        meningitis, parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia)

    -   Other psychotropic drug intoxication; neuroleptic malignant
        syndrome

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Airway protection, ventilatory and hemodynamic support as
        indicated

    -   Gastric lavage if within ﬁrst hour of ingestion

    -   Activated charcoal not useful for lithium overdose, but may be
        useful for other ingested medications; whole-bowel irrigation
        for sustained-release preparations

    -   Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) may be useful to bind
        lithium (monitor potassium if used)

    -   Aggressive normal saline hydration with close management of
        volume and electrolytes to enhance lithium excretion

    -   Indications for hemodialysis in acute ingestions: Decreased
        level of consciousness, seizures, renal failure with inability
        to excrete lithium, or lithium level \> 4 mEq/L; chronic
        ingestions: sympto- matic patient with lithium level \> 2.5
        mEq/L

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Morbidity and mortality from metabolites of methanol and eth-
        > ylene glycol; before breakdown, they all depress the central
        > nerv- ous system

    -   Methanol: Windshield washer ﬂuid, carburetor ﬂuid, glass clean-
        > ers, lacquers, adhesives, inks; formic acid (metabolite)
        > causes visual loss and metabolic acidosis

    -   Ethylene glycol: Antifreeze, deicing solutions, solvents; oxalic
        > acid (metabolite) causes renal failure

    -   Isopropanol: Rubbing alcohol, nail polish removers

    -   Anion gap, renal dysfunction, osmolal gap, abnormal ECG may be
        > seen

    -   Urine ﬂuoresces under Wood's lamp with ethylene glycol

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Ethanol ingestion

    -   Other causes of an anion gap acidosis

    -   Hypoglycemia

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Gastric lavage only if patient presented within 30 minutes;
        > acti- vated charcoal will not bind alcohols

    -   Maintain adequate airway and assist ventilation

    -   Supportive therapy for coma and seizures

    -   Fomepizole (Antizol) in any symptomatic adult or child, and in
        > an asymptomatic adult with methanol or ethylene glycol levels
        > \> 20 mg/dL; ethanol an alternative, blocks formation of

####  Methemoglobinemia 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen is hallmark of methemoglobinemia

    -   Seen in infants, especially after diarrheal illness

    -   Drugs that can oxidize normal ferrous (Fe^2+^) hemoglobin to
        abnor- mal ferric (Fe^3+^) hemoglobin (methemoglobin) include
        local anes- thetics (lidocaine, benzocaine), aniline dyes,
        nitrates and nitrites, nitrogen oxides, chloroquine,
        trimethoprim, dapsone, and phenazopyridine

    -   Methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen and decreases delivery of
        > oxygen bound to normal heme (shifting the oxyhemoglobin dis-
        > sociation curve to the left)

    -   Dizziness, nausea, headache, dyspnea, anxiety, tachycardia, and
        > weakness at low levels, to myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias,
        > decreased mentation, seizures, coma

    -   Saturation ﬁxed at 85% even in severe hypoxemia

    -   Deﬁnitive diagnosis is by co-oximetry (may be from a venous
        > sample); routine blood gas analysis may be falsely normal

    -   Blood may appear chocolate brown

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Hypoxemia

    -   Sulfhemoglobinemia

    -   Carbon monoxide or hydrogen sulﬁde poisoning

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Activated charcoal for recent ingestion

    -   Discontinue offending agent; high-ﬂow oxygen

    -   Intravenous methylene blue for symptomatic patients with high
        > methemoglobin levels or methemoglobin levels \> 30%; con-

####  Opioids 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Respiratory depression, miosis, altered mental status

    -   Signs of intravenous drug abuse (needle marks, a tourniquet)

    -   Some (propoxyphene, tramadol, dextromethorphan, meperidine) may
        > cause seizures

    -   Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema

    -   Meperidine or dextromethorphan plus a monoamine oxidase
        > inhibitor may produce serotonin syndrome

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Alcohol or sedative-hypnotic overdose

    -   Clonidine overdose

    -   Phenothiazine overdose

    -   Organophosphate or carbamate insecticide exposure

    -   Gamma-hydroxybutyrate overdose

    -   Congestive heart failure

    -   Infectious or metabolic encephalopathy

    -   Hypoglycemia, hypoxia, postictal state

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Naloxone for suspected overdose (0.4 mg IV for mildly sedated
        > patients suspected of opioid overdose; 2 mg IV for severely
        > sedated or comatose patient, repeat dose up to 10 mg IV)

    -   Naloxone will last for approximately 45 minutes if administered
        > intravenously, which is much shorter than the half-life of

####  Organophosphates and Carbamates 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Insecticides (eg, Orthene, malathion, parathion) and agents of
        chemical warfare (sarin) inhibit red blood cell
        acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and plasma cholinesterase and may be
        inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin

    -   Organophosphates permanently inactivate AchE; carbamates will
        dissociate from AchE within 24 hours

    -   Clinical manifestations secondary to cholinergic stimulation
        ("SLUDGE"): Salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gas-
        trointestinal distress, emesis

    -   Miosis, bradycardia, bronchospasm, bronchorrhea may also be
        observed

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Curare or neuromuscular blocker poisoning

    -   Hypothyroidism

    -   Pulmonary edema

    -   Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exac-
        erbation

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Decontaminate skin if exposed and avoid secondary exposure to
        health providers

    -   Nasogastric tube suction if within 1 hour, charcoal if possible;
        however, administration may be difﬁcult if patient is
        persistently vomiting

    -   100% oxygen; maintain adequate airway and assist ventilation as
        necessary, avoid succinylcholine if intubation required (use a
        non- depolarizing agent)

    -   Atropine (2--4 mg IV doses in adults, 0.05 mg/kg doses in chil-
        dren) doubling dose every 5--10 minutes until secretions stop;
        may require *very* large repeated doses or infusion

    -   Pralidoxime 1--2 g over 30 minutes, may repeat in 1 hour and
        every 4--8 hours

####  Salicylates 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Many over-the-counter products other than aspirin contain sali-
        > cylates, including Pepto-Bismol, various liniments

    -   Mild acute ingestion: Hyperpnea, lethargy, tinnitus

    -   Moderate intoxication: Severe hyperpnea, neurologic
        > disturbances, severe lethargy

    -   Severe intoxication: Fever, agitation, confusion, severe
        > hyperpnea, seizures

    -   Chronic pediatric ingestion: Hyperventilation, volume depletion,
        > acidosis, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory
        > alkalosis; in adults: hyperventilation, confusion, tremor,
        > paranoia, memory deﬁcits

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Any cause of anion gap metabolic acidosis

    -   Sepsis; carbon monoxide poisoning

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Elevated serum salicylate level; treatment should always
        > consider both serum level and clinical condition

    -   Gastrointestinal lavage or whole-bowel irrigation for early,
        > large, or sustained-release ingestions; activated charcoal

    -   Maintain adequate airway and assist ventilation, remembering
        > that these patients require extremely high minute ventilation
        > to combat metabolic acidosis

    -   Supportive therapy for coma, hyperthermia, hypotension, and
        > seizures; correct hypoglycemia and hypokalemia

    -   Intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline to main- tain
        > urine output at 2--3 mL/kg per hour; urinary alkaliniza- tion
        > with sodium bicarbonate to enhance salicylate excretion (urine
        > pH 7.5--8)

    -   Indications for hemodialysis: (1) serum salicylate levels \> 100
        > mg/dL in acute ingestions (60 mg/dL in chronic ingestions),
        > coma, seizures, renal or hepatic failure, and pulmonary

####  Theophylline 

-   ##### Essentials of Diagnosis

    -   Mild: Nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, tremor

    -   Severe: Any tachyarrhythmia, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, meta-
        bolic acidosis, hallucinations, hypotension, seizures

    -   Chronic: Vomiting, tachycardia, and seizures (may be the ﬁrst
        and only sign of chronic toxicity), but no hypokalemia or hyper-
        glycemia

    -   Wide pulse pressure early

    -   Theophylline level is essential to care

-   ##### Differential Diagnosis

    -   Salicylate overdose

    -   Caffeine overdose

    -   Iron toxicity

    -   Sympathomimetic poisoning

    -   Anticholinergic toxicity

    -   Thyroid storm

    -   Alcohol or other drug withdrawal

-   ##### Treatment

    -   Gastric lavage if presentation within 1 hour

    -   Activated charcoal mainstay of therapy

    -   Whole-bowel irrigation if no charcoal response, or if sustained
        release preparation is taken

    -   Oxygen; maintain adequate airway and assist ventilation

    -   Monitor for arrhythmias; correct hypokalemia

    -   Treat seizures with benzodiazepines

    -   Hypotension and tachycardia may respond to beta-blockade

    -   Indications for hemodialysis or hemoperfusion: Acute
        theophylline level \> 90 mg/L or rapidly approaching it; level
        of \> 40 mg/L chronically in a patient with a poor response to
        oral activated charcoal and any patient with ongoing seizures,
        ventricular dys- rhythmias, poorly responsive hypotension

-   ##### Pearl

> *Less commonly used than it once was in COPD; if inappropriate sinus
> tachycardia occurs in patients receiving this drug, beware of toxic
> levels: once seizures occur, the prognosis is far worse.*
