# - Hospital Insurance Entitlement

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Hospital insurance (HI), as well as supplementary medical insurance
> (SMI), is available to three basic groups of \"insured individuals\"-
> the aged, the disabled, and those with end stage renal disease.
> Following is an explanation of how an individual becomes \"insured\"
> as well as an explanation of the eligibility requirements for each
> group.

# - Insured Status

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> To be eligible for premium-free HI, an individual must be \"insured\"
> based on his or her own earnings or those of a spouse, parent, or
> child. To be insured, the worker must have a specific number of
> quarters of coverage (QCs); the exact number required is dependent
> upon whether the person is filing for HI on the basis of age,
> disability, or end stage renal disease. QCs are earned through payment
> of payroll taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)
> during the person\'s working years. QCs earned by an individual who
> pays the full FICA tax are usable to insure the person for both
> monthly social security benefits and HI.
>
> Federal employees were exempt from payment of FICA taxes prior to
> January 1983. However, beginning in January 1983, Federal employees
> became subject to the HI portion of the FICA tax (those actually
> employed in January 1983 were also deemed to have earned HI quarters
> of coverage for their Federal service prior to January 1983).
>
> Also, Government employees who pay only the HI portion of the FICA tax
> are only insured for HI; they are not insured for monthly social
> security benefits.
>
> State and local Government employees hired after March 31, 1986, are
> eligible for Medicare coverage and must pay the HI portion of the FICA
> tax. A State may elect to cover employees hired prior to April 1986
> for the Medicare portion of the FICA tax by requesting an agreement or
> modification of its existing agreement under section 218 of the Social
> Security Act.

# - Hospital Insurance for the Aged

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> To be eligible for HI on the basis of age, a person must be age 65 or
> older and either eligible for monthly social security or railroad
> retirement cash benefits, or would be eligible for such benefits if
> the worker\'s Government QCs were regular social security QCs. An
> individual who is insured for monthly benefits need not actually file
> for benefits to receive HI benefits. If such a person continues to
> work beyond age 65, he or she may instead elect to file an application
> for HI only.
>
> Premium-free HI for the aged begins with the month in which the
> individual attains age 65, provided he or she files an application for
> HI or for cash benefits and HI within 6 months of the month in which
> he or she attains age 65. If the application is filed later
>
> than that, HI entitlement can be retroactive for only 6 months. An
> individual attains age 65 on the day before his or her 65th birthday.
> For example, if an individual is born on August 1, the attainment date
> is July 31, and HI begins with July 1. Entitlement generally does not
> end until death.

# - Hospital Insurance for Disability Beneficiaries

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> A disabled person who is entitled to social security or railroad
> retirement benefits on the basis of disability is automatically
> entitled to HI after 24 months of entitlement to such benefits. Since
> there is a 5-month disability benefits waiting period, the person
> actually becomes entitled to HI after being disabled for 29 months.
>
> In addition, disabled persons who are not insured for monthly Social
> Security disability benefits but would be insured for such benefits if
> Government QCs were treated as social security QCs, are deemed to be
> entitled to disability benefits and automatically entitled to HI after
> being disabled for 29 months.
>
> The months in the Medicare qualifying period need not be consecutive
> so that months from a previous period of disability benefit
> entitlement generally may be counted in determining when the
> qualifying period requirement is met. HI entitlement on the basis of
> disability is available not only to the worker, but to the widow,
> widower, or child of a deceased, disabled, or retired worker if any of
> them become disabled within the meaning of the Social Security or
> Railroad Retirement Acts.
>
> If an individual recovers from a disability, HI entitlement ends with
> the month after the month he or she is notified of the disability
> termination. For example, if notification is November 15, entitlement
> ends December 31. However, if the individual\'s disability benefit
> entitlement ends only because he or she was working, HI entitlement
> may continue for up to 78 additional months.

# - Hospital Insurance for Persons Needing Kidney Transplant or Dialysis

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Individuals of any age with end stage renal disease (ESRD) who receive
> dialysis on a regular basis or a kidney transplant are eligible for HI
> (and are deemed enrolled for Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI)
> unless such coverage is refused) if they file an application. They
> must also meet certain work requirements for insured status under the
> social security or railroad retirement programs, or be entitled to
> monthly social security benefits or an annuity under the Railroad
> Retirement Act, or be the spouse or dependent child of an insured or
> entitled person.

# - Effective Date of Entitlement for Persons on Dialysis

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Entitlement usually begins after a 3-month waiting period has been
> served, i.e., with the first day of the third month after the month in
> which a course of regular dialysis begins. Entitlement begins before
> the waiting period has expired if the individual receives a transplant
> or participates in a self-dialysis training program during the waiting
> period.

# - Entitlement Based on Transplant

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Entitlement begins with the month the individual is admitted as an
> inpatient to a hospital for procedures in preparation for or in
> anticipation of a kidney transplant, provided the transplant surgery
> takes place within the following 2 months. If the transplant is
> delayed more than 2 months after the preparatory hospitalization,
> entitlement begins with the second month prior to the month of
> transplant. Under the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children\'s Health
> Insurance Program (SCHIP) Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of
> 2000, Congress extended immunosuppressive drug benefits to lifetime,
> as long as the beneficiary is entitled to Medicare and was entitled to
> Medicare when his/her transplant took place.

# - Effect on Self-dialysis Training on Entitlement

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Entitlement begins with the first month of the course of dialysis if
> the individual is expected to complete the self-dialysis training
> program and self-dialyze thereafter.

# - End of Coverage Based on ESRD

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> HI coverage based on ESRD ends with the earliest of the following
> dates:

-   The day an individual dies,

-   The last day of the 12th month after the month the course of
    > dialysis is discontinued, unless the individual receives a kidney
    > transplant during that period or begins another course of
    > dialysis, or

-   The last day of the 36th month after the month the person receives a
    > kidney transplant.

# - Reentitlement for Beneficiaries with ESRD

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> If a person whose entitlement based on ESRD has ended begins a new
> course of regular dialysis or has a kidney transplant, reentitlement
> begins without a waiting period.

# - Hospital Insurance Obtained by Premium Payment

> **(Rev. 1, 09-11-02)**

# - Eligibility Requirements

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Individuals who want hospital insurance coverage but who are not
> otherwise eligible (i.e., do not qualify under either the regular or
> deemed insured provisions, in §§10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 in this
> chapter) may obtain such coverage by enrolling timely, paying a
> monthly premium, and upon meeting the following three requirements:

-   Attaining age 65,

-   Enrolling or already having enrolled in the SMI program,

-   Being a resident of the U.S., and either:

    -   A citizen, or

    -   An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence who has
        > resided continuously in the U.S. for the 5 years prior to the
        > month of enrollment.

    1.  # - Premiums for Hospital Insurance

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Each year, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human
> Services announces the amount of the hospital insurance premium
> payable for each month in the following calendar year. The applicable
> premium amount is 33/76 (about 43.4 percent) of the hospital insurance
> deductible for that calendar year. The premium is rounded to the
> nearest \$1. An individual who is not entitled to free Part A and
> wishes this type of coverage must enroll him/herself during the
> appropriate enrollment period. A premium is due for each month of
> entitlement under Premium HI.

# - Premiums Paid by Other Than the Enrollee

### (Rev. 11764; Issued 12-22-22; Implementation: 01-01-2023; Effective 01-03-23)

> The following subsections describe Medicare Part A premiums paid by
> other than the enrollee.

# - Part A Buy-in States

### (Rev .11764; Issued 12-22-22; Implementation: 01-01-2023; Effective 01-03-23)

> States that include the payment of Medicare Part A premiums for
> Qualifying Medicare Beneficiaries (QMBs) in their state buy-in
> agreements are known as Part A buy-in states. Individuals in Part A
> buy-in states can file for Premium Part A at any time, without regard
> to enrollment periods. Late enrollment penalties do not apply. Please
> see the [[Manual for State Payment of Medicare Premiums, chapter 1,
> sections 1.7 and
> 1.11]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/chapter-1-program-overview-and-policy.pdf)
> for additional information about Part A buy-in states.

# - Part A Group Payer States

### (Rev. 11764; Issued 12-22-22; Implementation: 01-01-2023; Effective 01-03-23)

> States that do not include the payment of Medicare Part A premiums for
> QMBs in their state buy-in agreements are known as group payer states.
> To become entitled to Part A, individuals in group payer states can
> file for premium Part A during their Initial Enrollment Period (IEP)
> or the General Enrollment Period (GEP). Part A premiums and any
> applicable late enrollment penalties are paid under a group payer
> arrangement. Please see the [[Manual for State Payment of Medicare
> Premiums, chapter 1, section 1.7 and
> 1.11]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/chapter-1-program-overview-and-policy.pdf)
> for additional information about Part A group payer states.

# - Beginning of Coverage

> **(Rev. 1, 09-11-02)**

# - Initial Enrollment Period (IEP)

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Persons may enroll for premium hospital insurance by filing a request
> during the IEP which begins the third month before the month of first
> eligibility and lasts for 7 months. The individual\'s IEP for premium
> hospital insurance is in most cases the same 7-month period as the IEP
> for SMI.
>
> The individual may enroll for hospital insurance when he or she
> enrolls for SMI, or later during his or her IEP. The beginning date of
> an individual\'s premium hospital insurance coverage period is
> determined by the rules applicable to SMI coverage based on an SMI
> enrollment during an IEP. (See chapter 2 §40 in this chapter.)

# - General Enrollment Period (GEP)

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Eligible persons who have not enrolled for premium hospital insurance
> during their IEP, or whose premium hospital insurance has been
> terminated, may enroll during a GEP (January 1 - March 31 of each
> year) if they are enrolling or have enrolled for SMI. As with SMI, an
> eligible person who enrolls for hospital insurance during a GEP will
> have hospital insurance coverage beginning the following July.
>
> The same restrictions on enrollment and reenrollment apply as in the
> SMI program. Individuals who enroll late may pay a 10 percent premium
> penalty.

# 30 - End of Coverage for Hospital Insurance

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> A beneficiary\'s entitlement under the provision terminates:

-   With the month of the individual\'s death,

-   With the last day of the third month following the premium billing
    > month (for nonpayment of premiums),

-   With the end of the month following the month in which he or she
    > files a voluntary request for termination,

-   With the month SMI coverage is terminated, or

-   With the month before the month in which he or she becomes entitled
    > to hospital insurance under the regular or ESRD provisions. (See
    > [[§2,
    > §10.4](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/#10.4)]{.underline}
    > of this chapter.)

# - Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI)

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Unlike the HI benefits program, which is largely financed by
> compulsory taxes on employers, employees, and the self-employed, the
> SMI benefits program is a voluntary program financed from premium
> payments by enrollees, together with contributions from funds
> appropriated by the Federal Government, and certain deductible and
> cost-sharing provisions.

# - Eligibility for Enrollment

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> To obtain SMI coverage, eligible individuals must enroll in the plan
> during an enrollment period open to them and pay the required
> premiums. They are eligible to enroll if they are entitled to
> premium-free HI, or are age 65 and resident citizens or resident
> aliens. To qualify as a resident alien, an individual must have been
> lawfully admitted for permanent residence and have resided
> continuously in the United States during the 5 years immediately
> preceding the month of enrollment.

# - Automatic Enrollment in SMI

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Beneficiaries (except those residing in foreign countries or Puerto
> Rico) are deemed to have enrolled in SMI in the month before the month
> for which they are entitled to HI so that HI and SMI coverage start in
> the same month. Thus, monthly beneficiaries other than disability
> beneficiaries are deemed to enroll in the month before attainment of
> age
>
> 65\. Disability beneficiaries are deemed to enroll in the 24th
> consecutive month of entitlement to disability benefits.
>
> Every potential \"deemed\" enrollee is given a reasonable opportunity
> (at least 2 months) to decline SMI enrollment by filing notice to this
> effect. He or she is deemed not to have enrolled and does not incur
> any premium liability. A refusal of SMI not timely filed is
>
> treated as a request for voluntary termination under existing
> disenrollment rules once it has been established that the individual
> does not wish to have SMI.

# - Nature and Purpose of State Buy-in

### (Rev. 11764; Issued 12-22-22; Implementation: 01-01-2023; Effective 01-03-23)

> Under the State Buy-in program, states, the District of Columbia, and
> the U.S. territories may enter into buy-in agreements with CMS to
> enroll certain individuals who are dually eligible for Medicare and
> Medicaid into Medicare Part B and pay the premiums on their behalf.
>
> Most states have expanded their buy-in agreements to also include
> payments of Part A premiums for individuals who must pay a premium to
> enroll in Medicare Part A and who are eligible for the Qualified
> Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) eligibility group. State buy-in agreements
> maximize the number of full-benefit Medicaid recipients enrolled in
> Medicare, which ensures that Medicare pays primary to Medicaid. State
> buy-in agreements also facilitate enrollment in Medicare for low
> income individuals who are not eligible for full-benefit Medicaid
> coverage by paying Medicare premiums and cost sharing. Please see the
> [[Manual for State Payment of Medicare Premiums, chapter
> 1,]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/chapter-1-program-overview-and-policy.pdf)
> [[section
> 1.2]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/chapter-1-program-overview-and-policy.pdf)
> for additional state buy-in information.

# - End of Coverage

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> An individual may notify CMS in writing, at any time, that he or she
> no longer wishes to participate in the supplementary medical insurance
> plan. Termination of coverage takes effect at the close of the
> calendar month following the calendar month in which the request for
> termination was filed.
>
> Enrollment under medical insurance is terminated because of nonpayment
> of premiums. Termination is effective with the end of the grace period
> provided for payment of premiums. ([[See chapter 2, §40.7.4 of this
> manual]{.underline}](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/#40.7.4).)
>
> For individuals under age 65, enrollment is terminated because HI
> entitlement ended. SMI terminates at the same time as HI.
>
> If not terminated sooner, coverage ends with the beneficiary\'s death.

# - Termination and Reenrollment

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> An individual whose enrollment has terminated may reenroll only in a
> general enrollment period or a special enrollment period if the
> requirements are met.

# -- Premiums

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> A premium is due for each month of entitlement under SMI. The SMI
> premium covers about one-fourth of the cost of the Part B program.

# - Amount of Premiums

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> In the third quarter of each calendar year, the Secretary of the
> Department of Health and Human Services announces the base premium for
> SMI coverage that is payable as of the following January 1. The SMI
> premium is the same for all enrollees even though the cost to the
> program is greater for ESRD enrollees and the disabled than it is for
> the aged. The SMI premium is refigured each year and is based on the
> lower of one-half of SMI program costs per aged enrollee or the
> general percentage by which social security benefits were increased
> during the calendar year in which the announcement occurs. (During the
> 5-year period, January 1984 through December 1988, the formula for
> computing the SMI premium has been modified to provide that the Part B
> premium reflects exactly one-fourth of the cost of the Part B program.
> Beginning with the premium announced for the period beginning January
> 1989, however, the method of computing the SMI premium reverts back to
> the pre-January 1984 rules.)

# - Increase in Base Premium Amount

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The base premium that is announced by the Secretary is paid by most
> enrollees. However, it is increased for those who enroll late or
> reenroll after a prior termination of entitlement. The amount of the
> increase is 10 percent of the base rate for each full 12- month period
> during which the individual could have been but was not enrolled in
> the program. However, months in which an individual has GHP coverage
> based on current employment status are not counted as months in which
> the individual \"could have been, but was not enrolled.\" This
> exception does not apply to individuals who are entitled to Medicare
> on the basis of ESRD.

# - Collection of Premiums

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> SMI premiums are collected from benefits payable (in order of
> priority) by the Railroad Retirement Board, SSA, or Office of
> Personnel Management (Civil Service) unless the individual is covered
> under a State buy-in agreement. If the individual is entitled to such
> benefits but the payments are in suspense, e.g., due to work
> deductions, he or she is billed for the amounts due. Uninsured
> beneficiaries are also billed directly for the premiums due.
>
> Premium bills are sent every 3 months unless the individual
> specifically requests a monthly bill or is also entitled to Premium -
> HI (in which case a monthly combined SMI- Premium-HI bill is sent).

# - Grace Period for Payment

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> A grace period has been provided for payment of premiums by those who
> are billed directly. The period extends for 90 days after the month in
> which the bill is mailed. If the premiums are not received in that
> prescribed time, entitlement terminates at the end of the grace
> period. This 90-day grace period for paying overdue SMI premiums and
> continuing SMI coverage may be extended by CMS for good cause for up
> to an additional 90 days. Good cause, for example, is found if the
> enrollee was mentally or physically incapable of paying his or her
> premiums timely, or had some reasonable basis to believe that payment
> had been made, or the failure to pay was due to administrative error.

# - Payment After Grace Period Applies

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> If an extension to the grace period (additional 90 days; a total not
> to exceed 180 days) has been granted, an enrollee may retain SMI
> entitlement by paying all past due premiums if there was a good cause
> for his/her failure to pay premiums within the initial grace period.

# - Premiums Paid by Other Than the Enrollee

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The following subsections describe premiums paid by other than the
> enrollee.

# - Informal Arrangement

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Enrollees who are being billed directly for Medicare premiums may turn
> over their premium bills to a friend, relative, employer lodge, union
> or other organization to pay premiums on their behalf. The third party
> payer forwards the proper amount of payment for each enrollee to
> CMS\'s Premium Collection Center. Enrollees participating in this type
> of informal arrangement continue to receive their premium notice (Form
> CMS-500), and remain responsible for assuring that premiums paid on
> their behalf are paid timely in order to avoid termination of Medicare
> coverage.

# - Premium Payer

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Individuals may be designated as the premium payer for an enrollee and
> receive the enrollee\'s premium bills, if it is judged to be in the
> enrollee\'s best interest (e.g., the enrollee is competent, but too
> physically ill or infirm to be able to handle such matters). The
> individual receiving the premium bill must be a relative or friend
> showing personal interest in the welfare of the enrollee.

# - Formal Group Arrangement

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Employers, religious orders, lodges, unions or other organizations may
> enter into a formal agreement with CMS in order to receive a single
> bill and pay a lump sum for the premiums due from a group of
> individuals. Group payments under a formal group agreement may be made
> only on behalf of individuals who are already enrolled and are being
> billed for direct remittance. This type of arrangement is referred to
> as a \"Formal Group Payer\" arrangement. While included in a formal
> group payer arrangement, enrollees will no longer receive a premium
> notice (Form CMS-500). This arrangement is available only where the
> number of enrollees in the group is large enough to make it
> practicable to send one bill to the group payer and where the
> following conditions are also met:

-   Enrollees included under the formal group arrangement are directly
    > billed for their premium, and are not having his/her premiums
    > deducted from a Social Security, Railroad Retirement, or Civil
    > Service benefit, or, are not having premiums paid by a State
    > Medicaid agency under a State buy-in agreement;

-   The enrollee authorizes the formal group payer to pay premiums on
    > his/her behalf;

-   The formal group payer has a minimum of 20 enrollees; and

-   The formal group payer agrees to submit premium payments via
    > electronic funds transfer.

> If the formal group payer agreement is terminated, or if the group
> payer alerts CMS to remove an individual from the group payer
> arrangement, CMS will resume collection of premiums from the
> individual through the direct billing process.

# - Premium Surcharge Payment

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> States or local Governments may pay a lump sum for the total amount of
> the SMI late enrollment premium surcharge for a group of individuals.
> In order to pay the premium surcharge, States or local Governmental
> entities are required to enter into a formal agreement with CMS. An
> individual is not billed for the premium surcharge portion of his/her
> SMI premium while under a premium surcharge agreement, however, he/she
> is billed for the base premium amount. If the enrollee is receiving a
> Social Security, Railroad Retirement, or Civil Service annuity, the
> agencies responsible for these programs will continue to withhold the
> base premium amount from the annuity.
>
> Enrollees who are billed directly for premiums will continue to
> receive a premium bill for the base premium amount.
>
> The ultimate responsibility for paying premiums rests with the
> enrollees.

# - Premiums Under Buy-In

#### *(Rev. 12046, Issued:05-18-23, Effective:01-01-23, Implementation:06-21-23)*

> States pay the Part B premiums for any eligible individual specified
> in the state's buy-in agreement. Under buy-in agreements, states can
> enroll individuals in Part B at any time without regard to Medicare
> enrollment periods or late enrollment penalties. Please see the
> [[Manual for State Payment of Medicare Premiums, chapter 1, section
> 1.4]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/chapter-1-program-overview-and-policy.pdf)
> for additional information about state payment of premiums under a
> buy-in agreement.

## *-- Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP) for Premium Part A*

#### *(Rev. 12046, Issued:05-18-23, Effective:01-01-23, Implementation:06-21-23)*

> *If an individual did not enroll in premium Part A when first
> eligible, they may have to pay a higher monthly premium if they decide
> to enroll later. The monthly premium for Part A may increase up to
> 10%. The individual will have to pay the higher premium for twice the
> number of years the individual could have had Part A, but did not sign
> up.*
>
> *For individuals enrolling using the SEP Related to Coverage Under
> Group Health Plans, the premium Part A LEP is calculated by adding the
> months that have elapsed between the close of the individual's IEP and
> the end of the month in which the individual*
>
> *enrolls. For enrollments after your IEP has ended, months where you
> had group health plan coverage are excluded from the LEP calculation.*
>
> *For individuals enrolling using an Exceptional Conditions SEP, the
> International Volunteers SEP, or the SEP for Certain TRICARE
> Beneficiaries, no LEP will be applied.*

## *-- Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP) for Premium Part B*

#### *(Rev. 12046, Issued:05-18-23, Effective:01-01-23, Implementation:06-21-23)*

> *If an individual did not sign up for Part B when first eligible, the
> individual may have to pay a late enrollment penalty for as long as
> the individual has Medicare. The individual's monthly premium for Part
> B may go up 10% for each full 12-month period that the individual
> could have had Part B, but did not sign up for it.*
>
> *For individuals enrolling using the SEP Related to Coverage Under
> Group Health Plans, the Part B LEP is calculated by adding the months
> that have elapsed between the close of the individual's IEP and the

>
> *For individuals enrolling using an Exceptional Conditions SEP, the
> International Volunteers SEP, or the SEP for Certain TRICARE
> Beneficiaries, no LEP will be applied.*
>
> *For individuals enrolling using the D-SEP, the Part B LEP is
> calculated by adding all months during which the large group health
> plan (LGHP) was secondary payer beginning with the end of the IEP, or
> the date LGHP coverage began.*

# - Waiver of Enrollment Period Requirements Due to Administrative Error

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> CMS and SSA are authorized to take necessary action to correct an
> erroneous SMI or premium hospital insurance enrollment or
> nonenrollment which was based upon the action, inaction, or error of a
> Government officer, employee, or agent. The action may include
> designating special individual enrollment periods and premium
> adjustments.
>
> For the purpose of this provision, an individual\'s enrollment or
> nonenrollment in SMI is considered to have been prejudiced and due to
> the \"action, inaction, or error\" of an officer, employee, or agent
> of the Government, if there is an official record or other evidence
> showing that:

-   The individual took reasonable appropriate and timely measures to
    > assert his or her rights, and

-   Due to administrative fault or other action, which may or may not
    > have been erroneous at the time taken, his or her rights have been
    > or are likely to be impaired unless relief is given.

> This authority applies to all Part B cases which have arisen since the
> Medicare program began on July 1, 1966. It is applied to cases that
> come to CMS\'s or SSA\'s attention; however, MACs should not search
> their files.

> coverage during an employer's open enrollment period in October, for a
> January 1^st^ effective date, the individual can submit their request
> for termination of the Part B-ID benefit in October or November, and
> not lose their Part B-ID benefit prior to the January 1^st^ effective
> date.

c.  When a state ends buy-in for Part B-ID because an individual gained
    > full Medicaid eligibility that includes immunosuppressive drug
    > coverage, the individual must report this new eligibility to SSA
    > and terminate Part B-ID coverage.

> If a Part B-ID covered individual fails to notify SSA of their
> enrollment in other health coverage, including employer and Medicaid,
> Part B-ID will terminate effective the first day of the month after
> the month in which SSA discovers the individual has other health
> coverage.

2.  **Voluntary termination request --** In general, Part B-ID
    > terminates effective with the first day of the month following the
    > month in which we receive the request.

> There is an exception to this general rule for individuals who had
> state payment of their Part B-ID premium under a Medicare Savings
> Program (as described in section 40.9.9) and who are notified by SSA
> that their state will no longer pay their Medicare Part B-ID premiums.
> For these individuals the following entitlement end dates apply:

a.  If the individual files a voluntary termination request within 30
    > days after the date of the notice that state payment of premiums
    > will end or has ended, the individual\'s Part B-ID entitlement
    > ends on the last day of the last month for which the state paid
    > the premium.

b.  If the individual files the voluntary termination request more than
    > 30 days but not more than 6 months after state payment of Medicare
    > Part B-ID premiums ends, Part B-ID entitlement ends on the last
    > day of the month in which the request is filed.

c.  If the individual files the voluntary termination request later than
    > the 6th month after state payment of Medicare Part B-ID premiums

> ends, entitlement ends at the end of the month after the month in
> which request is filed.
>
> We note that individuals who lose eligibility for state payment of
> Medicare Part B-ID premiums through a Medicare Savings Program will
> continue to be eligible for the Part B-ID benefit without interruption
> with the individual assuming responsibility for paying the Part B-ID
> premiums, unless they voluntarily terminate. The options for financial
> relief from Part B billing in SSA's Program Operations Manual System
> (POMS), section HI.00815.042, also apply for the Part B-ID coverage
> here.

3.  **Death** - Entitlement to Part B-ID continues into the month of
    > death, **up to and including the date of death.**

4.  **Non-payment of premiums** -- Part B-ID coverage will terminate for
    > non- payment of premiums following the same rules, including grace
    > periods, used for Medicare Part B for monthly billing in sections
    > 40.5 and 40.7.4 of this manual. Note that section 40.5 provides
    > end of coverage information, and section 40.7.4 provides grace
    > period payment information.

5.  **Individual becomes entitled to Medicare on another basis** -- In
    > cases where a Part B-ID enrollee becomes eligible for Medicare
    > based on age, disability, or ESRD, Part B-ID will terminate
    > effective with the last day of the month prior to the month in
    > which they become entitled on the other basis. Equitable relief
    > for retroactivity may apply.

> provision, but will not be increased based on late enrollment.
>
> If the individual is directly billed for premiums, billing will be on
> a monthly basis.

# - Medicare Savings Programs for Part B-ID Premiums

### (Rev. 11764; Issued 12-22-22; Implementation: 01-01-2023; Effective 01-03-23)

> Individuals enrolled in Part B-ID with limited income and resources
> may be eligible for assistance through the Medicare Savings Programs
> (MSPs). The MSPs include three eligibility groups that cover Part B-ID
> premiums and sometimes cost sharing, including:

-   Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB)

-   Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB)

-   Qualifying Individuals (QI)

> There are two ways to enroll in the MSPs for the payment of the Part
> B-ID premiums. First, once enrolled in Part B-ID, individuals may
> apply for the MSPs and be determined eligible by their state for an
> MSP eligibility group based on Part B-ID.
>
> Second, individuals who are enrolled in an MSP group and lose Medicare
> entitlement based on ESRD 36 months after the month in which they
> receive a kidney transplant can transition to an MSP based on Part
> B-ID enrollment without a break in coverage if:
>
> (1)they attest that they do not have other health coverage as
> described in 40.9.1 by the end of the 36th month after the month in
> which they receive a kidney transplant; and (2) the state redetermines
> the individual's Medicaid eligibility on all bases and does not
> otherwise find the individual ineligible for the MSP group.

# - Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (M*BI*)

#### *(Rev. 12046, Issued:05-18-23, Effective:01-01-23, Implementation:06-21-23)*

> The term Medicare beneficiary identifier (M*BI*) is a general term
> describing a beneficiary's Medicare identification number. For
> purposes of this manual, Medicare beneficiary identifier references
> both the Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) and the Medicare
> Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) during the new Medicare card transition
> period and after for certain business areas that will continue to use
> the HICN as part of their processes.

# 60 - Medicare Part C, Medicare+Choice

### (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Medicare Part C, which is also known as Medicare+Choice, is a Medicare
> program that gives beneficiaries more choices among health plans.
> Everyone who has Medicare Parts A and B is eligible, except those who
> have end stage renal disease, and were not in a Medicare+Choice plan
> at the onset of this condition.
>
> Public Law 105-33, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, establishes a new
> authority permitting contracts between CMS and a variety of different
> managed care and fee-for- service entities. The types of entities that
> may be granted contracts under this new authority include:

-   Coordinated care plans, including Health Maintenance Organizations
    > (HMOs), Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), and
    > Provider-Sponsored Organizations

> (PSOs). A PSO is defined as a public or private entity established by
> health care providers, which provide a substantial proportion of
> health care items and services directly through affiliated providers
> who share, directly or indirectly, substantial financial risk.

-   Religious fraternal benefit society plans which may restrict
    > enrollment to members of the church, convention or group with
    > which the society is affiliated. Payments to such plans may be
    > adjusted, as appropriate to take into account the actuarial
    > characteristics and experience of plan enrollees.

-   Private fee-for-service plans which reimburse providers on a
    > fee-for-service basis, and are authorized to charge enrolled
    > beneficiaries up to 115 percent of the plan\'s payment schedule
    > (which may be different from the Medicare fee schedule).

> In addition to the Medicare+Choice contractors, beginning in January,
> 1999, up to 390,000 beneficiaries will have the choice (on a
> demonstration basis ending January 1, 2003) of enrolling in a Medical
> Savings Account (MSA) option. Under this option, beneficiaries would
> obtain high deductible health policies that pay for at least all
> Medicare-covered items and services after an enrollee meets the annual
> deductible of up to \$6,000. The difference between the premiums for
> such high deductible policies and the applicable Medicare+Choice
> premium amount would be placed into an account for the beneficiary to
> use in meeting his or her deductible expenses.
>
> **Past 1876 Contracts** - HMO/CMP risk plans that remain in compliance
> with current contracting standards and comply with new requirements
> established under this statutory authority automatically transitioned
> into the Part C Medicare+Choice program. Section 1876 risk-based
> contractors were paid under a new Medicare+Choice payment methodology
> rather than the prior method in section 1876(a), and were subject to
> certain other Medicare+Choice provisions. The Secretary no longer
> accepts new 1876 risk applications. As of January 1, 1999, existing
> 1876 risk-based contracts were terminated, and plans in good standing
> transitioned to the Medicare+Choice program.
>
> **Repeal of Cost Option** - As of August 5, 1997, the Secretary is
> prohibited from entering into any new 1876 cost-based contracts,
> unless the plan is a Health Care Prepayment Plan with an agreement
> under section 1833 of the Social Security Act. The 1876 cost-based
> payment authority is repealed and all cost contracts are terminated as
> of December 31, 2002.
>
> **Limited HCPP Option** - Beginning January 1, 1999, the Secretary may
> only contract with those HCPPs that are sponsored by Union or Employer
> groups, or HCPPs that do not \"provide, or arrange for the provision
> of, any inpatient hospital services \....\" This amendment will result
> in the termination of section 1833 agreements with any organization
> that does not meet the new definition. CMS will establish transition
> rules for 1876 risk-based contractors that currently receive
> reimbursement on a cost basis for enrollees remaining under a previous
> HCPP agreement.
>
