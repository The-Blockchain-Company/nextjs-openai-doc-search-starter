10. # - Hospital Insurance (Part A)

    1.  []{#_bookmark2 .anchor}**- Inpatient Hospital Deductible**

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The patient is responsible for a deductible amount for inpatient
> hospital services in each benefit period. For each year after 1991,
> the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is
> required to set the deductible and coinsurance amounts between
> September 1 and September 15 of the preceding year. The deductible
> will be set at an amount equal to the deductible for the preceding
> year, changed by the same percentage as applies to PPS payment rates,
> and adjusted to reflect changes in real case mix. The deductible and
> coinsurance amounts are shown in the chart in
> [§10.3](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/#10.3) of this chapter.
>
> The coinsurance amount is based on the deductible applicable for the
> calendar year in which the coinsurance days occur. The deductible is
> satisfied only by charges for covered Part A services. Expenses for
> covered services count toward the deductible on an incurred, rather
> than paid, basis. Expenses incurred in one benefit period cannot be
> applied toward the deductible in a later benefit period. Expenses
> incurred in meeting the blood deductible do not count toward the
> inpatient hospital deductible.
>
> A reduction in benefit days resulting from confinement in a
> psychiatric hospital, on and immediately preceding the date of
> entitlement, does not affect the amount of the deductible for which
> the patient is responsible.
>
> If the actual charge is less than the deductible and the customary
> charge, the customary charge is applied to the deductible.
>
> A beneficiary is not responsible for payment of the deductible for an
> inpatient stay if the provider has been determined to be liable
> because the care was not medically necessary or because the care
> provided was custodial.

# - Coinsurance

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The following subsections describe coinsurance.

# - Inpatient Services

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> In each benefit period, the patient is responsible for coinsurance
> amounts equal to:

-   One-fourth of the inpatient hospital deductible for each day of
    inpatient hospital services from the 61st through the 90th days;

-   One-half of the inpatient hospital deductible for each lifetime
    reserve day (the 91st through the 150th days of inpatient hospital
    services); and

-   One-eighth of the inpatient hospital deductible for each day of
    extended care services from the 21st through the 100th days. A
    beneficiary is not responsible for payment of the coinsurance for a
    stay if the provider has been determined to be liable because the
    care was not medically necessary or because the care provided was
    custodial.

> Use the chart in [§10.3](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/#10.3)
> of this chapter to determine the applicable coinsurance amounts.
>
> Where the actual charge to the patient for the 61st through the 90th
> days of inpatient hospital services is less than the applicable
> coinsurance amount, the coinsurance is the actual charge per day.
> Where the actual charge to the patient for lifetime reserve days is
> less than the coinsurance amount for those days, the
>
> beneficiary may be deemed to have elected not to use the days because
> he/she would not benefit from their utilization.

# - Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Furnished as a Home Health Benefit

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The patient is responsible for 20 percent of the payment amount for
> DME furnished as a home health benefit.

# - Basis for Determining the Part A Coinsurance Amounts

### *(Rev. 11641; Issued:10-13-2022; Effective: 01-10-2023; Implementation: 01-03-2023)*

> The applicable inpatient deductible is the one in effect during the
> calendar year in which the patient\'s benefit period begins (i.e., in
> most cases, the year in which the first inpatient hospital services
> are furnished in the benefit period). Except for 1989, the coinsurance
> amount is based on the deductible applicable for the calendar year in
> which the coinsurance days occur.

1.  Coinsurance was not charged for inpatient hospital care in CY 1989
    due to Catastrophic Coverage. The deductible was applied.

2.  Under Catastrophic Coverage, a coinsurance payment of \$25.50 was
    due for days 1-8 of SNF care. No SNF coinsurance was due after day 8
    in 1989.

    1.  # - Benefit Period (Spell of Illness)

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> A benefit period is a period of time for measuring the use of hospital
> insurance benefits. It is a period of consecutive days during which
> covered services furnished to a patient, up to certain specified
> maximum amounts, may be paid for by the hospital insurance plan.
>
> For example, a patient is eligible for 90 days of hospital care in a
> benefit period and 100 days of extended care services during the same
> benefit period. A patient may be eligible for as many as l50 days of
> hospital care in a benefit period if he/she draws on his/her lifetime
> reserve. As long as a person continues to be entitled to hospital
> insurance, there is no limit on the number of benefit periods he/she
> may have. The term \"benefit period\" is synonymous with spell of
> illness. Since the term \"spell of illness\" could connote a
>
> single illness or a particular \"spell\" of sickness, the term benefit
> period is used in communications with the public.

# - Starting a Benefit Period

## (Rev. 80, Issued: 10-26-12, Effective: 04-01-13, Implementation: 04-01-13)

> A benefit period begins with the first day (not included in a previous
> benefit period) on which a patient is furnished inpatient hospital or
> extended care services by a qualified provider in a month for which
> the patient is entitled to hospital insurance benefits.
>
> A provider qualified to start a benefit period is a hospital
> (including a psychiatric hospital) or SNF that meets all the
> requirements of the definition of such an institution. A hospital
> which meets all requirements in [Chapter 5,
> §20](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/ge101c05.asp#20) of this
> manual is also a qualified hospital for purposes of beginning a
> benefit period when it furnishes the patient covered inpatient
> emergency services. Thus, generally, the benefit period begins when
> covered inpatient services are initially furnished to an entitled
> individual. However, the noncovered services furnished by a
> nonparticipating provider can begin a spell of illness
>
> only if the provider is a qualified provider. A qualified provider is
> a hospital (including a psychiatric hospital) or a SNF which meets all
> requirements in the definition of such an institution even though it
> may not be participating. A qualified hospital in Canada or Mexico is
> also a qualified provider for purposes of beginning a benefit period
> when it furnishes covered inpatient hospital services. If a person is
> in a nonqualified institution and is subsequently transferred to a
> qualified hospital (general or psychiatric), his/her benefit period
> begins on admission to the qualified hospital.
>
> Admission to a qualified SNF or to the SNF level of care in a
> swing-bed hospital begins a benefit period even though payment for the

# - Ending a Benefit Period

## (Rev. 80, Issued: 10-26-12, Effective: 04-01-13, Implementation: 04-01-13)

> The benefit period ends with the close of a period of 60 consecutive
> days during which the patient was neither an inpatient of a hospital
> nor of a SNF. To determine the 60 consecutive day period, begin
> counting with the day the individual was discharged. (See
>
> [§10.4.3.2](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/#10.4.3.2) of this
> chapter for determining the end of a benefit period when an individual
> remains in a SNF.)
>
> As noted in section 10.4, the term "benefit period" is synonymous with
> spell of illness. However, the statutory language (at §1861(a) of the
> Social Security Act) that describes a benefit period as a "spell of
> illness" is sometimes misunderstood to mean that a benefit period is
> linked to a particular medical episode or type of condition, so that
> the onset of a new and entirely unrelated condition could serve to end
> a benefit period even in the absence of a 60-day break in the
> beneficiary's "inpatient" status. In fact, the onset of a new
> condition is not, in itself, relevant to the ending of a benefit
> period, which can occur **only** through a 60-day break in inpatient
> status, as described above.

# - Definition of Hospital or SNF for Ending a Benefit Period

## (Rev.10880, Issued: 08-06-21, Effective: 11-08- 21, Implementation: 11-08-21)

> It is important to note that a benefit period cannot end while a
> beneficiary is an inpatient (see §10.4.4) of an institution that meets
> the basic definition of a "hospital" at
>
> §1861(e)(1) of the Social Security Act (the Act), even if the hospital

> for starting a benefit period, as discussed further in §10.4.3.1 below
> (see also §1861(e) following (9) of the Act and the regulations at 42

> the basic definition of a "SNF" at
>
> §1819(a)(1) of the Act, as discussed further in §10.4.3.2 below.

# - Hospital Stay and End of Benefit Period

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> In order to end a benefit period, for at least 60 consecutive days, a
> beneficiary cannot have been in a hospital which meets the initial
> requirement in the definitions in
> [Chapter](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/ge101c05.asp#20.1)
> [5, §20.1](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/ge101c05.asp#20.1)
> through §20.7 of this publication. That is, the beneficiary cannot
> have been in a facility that is primarily engaged in providing, by or
> under the supervision of a physician(s), to inpatients:

-   Diagnostic and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis,
    treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons or
    rehabilitation services for injured, disabled, or sick persons; or

-   Psychiatric services for the diagnosis and treatment of mentally ill
    persons. A stay in a hospital outside the United States prolongs a
    benefit period. It may be assumed, in the absence of evidence to the
    contrary, that:

-   A foreign hospital in which a beneficiary spent one or more days
    meets the requirement of the definition in Chapter 5,
    [§20](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/#20) of this manual;
    and

-   The beneficiary\'s statement about length and place of stay is
    correct.

# - SNF Stay and End of Benefit Period

## (Rev.10880, Issued: 08-06-21, Effective: 11-08- 21, Implementation: 11-08-21

> Similarly, to end a benefit period, a beneficiary cannot have been an
> inpatient (see
>
> §10.4.4) of a SNF for at least 60 consecutive days; where SNF is
> defined in accordance with §§1861(a)(2) and 1819(a)(1) of the Social
> Security Act as a facility which is primarily engaged in providing
> skilled nursing care and related services to residents who require
> medical or nursing care, or rehabilitation services for the
> rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons. As indicated
> above in §10.4.3, all Medicare-certified SNFs (including
> Medicare-certified distinct part SNFs) are automatically considered to
> meet this basic "SNF" definition by reason of the Medicare
> certification itself. See §2166 of the State Operations Manual (Pub.
> 100-07), Chapter 2, for the administrative criteria used in
> determining whether the basic "SNF" definition is met by a nursing
> home that is not Medicare-certified (including the noncertified
> portion of an institution that also contains a Medicare-certified
> distinct part SNF).
>
> Examples: An individual may be discharged from and readmitted to a
> hospital or SNF several times during a benefit period and still be in
> the same benefit period if 60 consecutive days have not elapsed
> between discharge and readmission. The stays need not be for related
> physical or mental conditions.
>
> Example 1: X was born 8/9/1936. On 7/28/2001, X entered a
> participating general hospital. After he/she had been in the hospital
> for 2 weeks, X was discharged on 8/11/2001. On his/her doctor's
> orders, X entered a participating SNF on 8/15/2001, and remained an
> inpatient there (see §10.4.4) until his/her discharge on 10/27/2001.
> He/she had no further inpatient stays in 2001.
>
> X's benefit period began on 8/1/2001, the first day of the month
> he/she attained age 65 and was entitled to hospital insurance. The
> benefit period ended 12/25/2001, the end of the 60-day period
> beginning with the date of his/her last discharge.
>
> Example 2: Y, over age 65, entered a participating general hospital on
> 8/28/2000 for treatment of a heart condition. He/she was discharged on
> 9/11/2000. On 10/3/2000, Y entered a Medicaid-only nursing facility,
> and remained an inpatient of this facility (see
>
> §10.4.4) until his/her discharge on 11/17/2000. On 12/26/2000, Y was
> again admitted to a participating hospital because of injuries
> suffered in an accident. He/she was discharged on 1/13/2001 and had no
> further inpatient stays in 2001.
>
> Y's benefit period began on 8/28/2000. His/her stay in the nursing
> facility began less than 60 days after his/her hospital stay and the
> benefit period was continued because he/she remained an inpatient
> there (see §10.4.4) even though Medicare did not cover the
>
> stay. The subsequent hospital stay began less than 60 days after the

> condition treated was unrelated to his/her prior stays. The benefit
> period ended on 3/14/2001, the end of the 60-day period beginning with
> the day of last discharge.
>
> Example 3: Z, over age 65 and entitled to hospital insurance benefits,
> was admitted to General Hospital on 8/l/2000 and discharged on
> 8/10/2000, having received nonemergency hospital services. General
> Hospital met all the requirements in the definition of a hospital
> except those concerning utilization review and health and safety.
> While General Hospital met the minimum requirements of an emergency
> hospital, Z's benefit period did not begin with his/her admission to
> this hospital because:

1.  The hospital did not meet all of the requirements in the definition
    of a hospital; and

2.  Although the hospital satisfied the minimum requirements for
    coverage of emergency services, Z did not receive emergency
    inpatient care there.

> (As noted previously, a stay in an emergency hospital does not begin a
> benefit period unless it actually involves the receipt of covered
> inpatient emergency services; by contrast, even a nonemergency stay in
> such a hospital can serve as a qualifying hospital stay for purposes
> of coverage under the posthospital extended care benefit.) Z was
> admitted to Haven Convalescent Home on 8/20/2000 and remained an
> inpatient of the home (see §10.4.4) until his/her discharge on
> 3/1/2001. He/she had no further inpatient stays in 2001. Haven
> Convalescent Home became a participating SNF on 1/1/2001.
>
> Z\'s benefit period began 1/1/2001, the day Haven Convalescent Home
> was determined to be a qualified SNF. The services Z received from
> that date through discharge were extended care services even though
> they were not covered and, therefore, not charged against Z's Medicare
> SNF utilization. (The services were not covered posthospital extended
> care services because Z was not admitted to a participating SNF within
> 30 days after discharge from the hospital.) Z's benefit period ended
> 4/29/2001, the end of the 60- day period beginning with the date of
> his discharge from the convalescent home.

# - Definition of Inpatient for Ending a Benefit Period

## (Rev. 80, Issued: 10-26-12, Effective: 04-01-13, Implementation: 04-01-13)

> Generally, a beneficiary is an inpatient of a hospital if the
> beneficiary is receiving inpatient services in the hospital (i.e., not
> on an outpatient basis). The type of care actually received is not
> relevant.
>
> However, a different definition of inpatient applies in determining
> the end of a benefit period for a beneficiary in a SNF, under which
> such a beneficiary is considered an inpatient in this context only if
> the beneficiary\'s care in the SNF meets certain skilled level of care
> standards. Specifically, the beneficiary must need and receive a
> skilled level of care while in the SNF.
>
> This means that in order to have been an "inpatient" for benefit
> period purposes while in a SNF, the beneficiary must have required and
> received skilled services on a daily basis which could, as a practical
> matter, only have been provided in a SNF on an inpatient basis. (Under
> the regulations at 42 CFR 409.60(b)(2), an additional level of care
> criterion at 42 CFR 409.31(b)(2)\--requiring that the SNF care must in
> some way relate back to a condition that was present during the
> beneficiary's qualifying hospital stay\--does not apply to benefit
> period determinations.) If these provisions were not met during the
> prior SNF stay, the beneficiary was not an inpatient of the SNF for
> purposes of prolonging the benefit period. Conversely, a beneficiary
> would remain an SNF "inpatient" in this context (thus prolonging his
> or her current benefit period) for as long as the beneficiary
> continues receiving a skilled level of care in the SNF\--even if Part
> A payment has ended due to the beneficiary's exhaustion of SNF
> benefits.
>
> Use the following presumptions for determining whether the skilled
> level of care standards were met during a prior SNF stay.
>
> Presumption 1: A beneficiary\'s care in a SNF met the skilled level of
> care standards if a Medicare SNF claim was paid for the care, unless
> such payment was made under limitation on liability rules.
>
> Presumption 2: A beneficiary\'s care in a SNF met the skilled level of
> care standards if a SNF claim was paid for the services provided in
> the SNF under the special Medicare limitation on liability rules
> pursuant to placement in a non-certified bed.
>
> Presumption 3: A beneficiary\'s care in a SNF did not meet the skilled
> level of care standards if a claim was paid for the services provided
> in the SNF pursuant to the general Medicare limitation on liability
> rules. (This presumption does not apply to placement in a
> non-certified bed. For claims paid under these special provisions, see
> Presumption 2.)
>
> Presumption 4: A beneficiary\'s care in a Medicaid nursing facility
> (NF) did not meet the skilled level of care standards if a Medicaid
> claim for the services provided in the NF was denied on the grounds
> that the services received were not at the NF level of care (even if
> paid under applicable Medicaid administratively necessary days
> provisions which result in payment for care not meeting the NF level
> of care requirements).
>
> Presumption 5: A beneficiary\'s care in a SNF met the skilled level of
> care standards if a Medicare SNF claim for the services provided in
> the SNF was denied on grounds other than that the services were not at
> the skilled level of care.
>
> Presumption 6: A beneficiary\'s care in a SNF did not meet the skilled
> level of care standards if a Medicare claim for the services provided
> in the SNF was denied on the grounds that the services were not at the
> skilled level of care and no limitation of liability payment was made.
>
> Presumption 7: A beneficiary\'s care in a SNF did not meet the skilled
> level of care standards if no Medicare or Medicaid claim was submitted
> by the SNF.
>
> Presumptions 1 through 4 cannot be rebutted. Thus, prior Medicare and
> Medicaid claim determinations that necessarily required a level of
> care determination for the time period under consideration are binding
> for purposes of a later benefit period calculation.
>
> Presumptions 5 through 7 can be rebutted by the beneficiary showing
> that the level of care needed or received is other than that which the
> presumption dictates.
>
> Presumption 6 can be rebutted because the Medicare skilled level of
> care definition for coverage purposes is broader than the skilled
> level of care definition used here for benefit period determinations.
> Specifically, the requirement referred to in Chapter 4,
> [§40.2](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/ge101c04.asp#40.2)
> regarding prior hospital care related to the SNF care is included in
> the Medicare SNF coverage requirements but is not included in the
> standard for benefit period determinations. Therefore, Medicare
> payment could have been denied for a SNF stay on level of care grounds
> (i.e., not even waiver payment was made) because of noncompliance with
> that requirement, even though skilled level of care requirements for
> benefit period determinations were in fact met by the SNF stay.
> Consequently, when Medicare SNF payment is denied on level of care
> grounds, the beneficiary must be given the opportunity to demonstrate
> that he/she still needed and received a skilled level of care for
> purposes of benefit period determinations.
>
> **NOTE:** Effective October 1, 1990, the levels of care that were
> previously covered separately under the Medicaid SNF and intermediate
> care facility (ICF) benefits are combined in a single Medicaid nursing
> facility (NF) benefit. Thus, the Medicaid NF benefit includes
> essentially the same type of skilled care covered by Medicare\'s SNF
> benefit, but it includes less intensive care as well. This means that
> when a person is found not to require at least a Medicaid NF level of
> care (as under Presumption 4), it can be presumed that he or she also
> does not meet the Medicare skilled level of care standards. However,
> since the NF benefit can include care that is less intensive than
> Medicare SNF care, merely establishing that a person does require NF
> level care does not necessarily mean that he or she also meets the
> Medicare skilled level of care standards.
>
> Determining whether an individual who requires NF level care also
> meets the Medicare skilled level of care standards requires an actual
> examination of the medical evidence and cannot be accomplished through
> the simple use of a presumption. Therefore, the previous references to
> Medicaid claims have been deleted from those presumptions which
> establish that an individual does meet the Medicare standards.
>
> Medicare no-payment bills submitted by a SNF result in Medicare
> program payment determinations (i.e., denials). Therefore, such
> no-payment bills trigger the appropriate presumptions. This also
> applies in any State where the Medicaid program utilizes no- payment
> bills which lead to Medicaid program payment determinations. If a SNF
> erroneously fails to submit a Medicare claim (albeit a no-pay claim)
> when Medicare rules require such submission, A/B MACs (A) request a
> SNF to submit one. Once the no-pay bill is submitted and denied, the
> applicable presumption (other than presumption 7) is
>
> triggered. If a patient is moving from a SNF level of care to a
> non-SNF level of care in a facility certified to provide SNF care,
> occurrence code 22 (date active care ended) is used to signify the
> beginning of the no-pay period on the bill and trigger the appropriate
> presumptions.
>
> Where the presumptions are rebuttable (i.e., 5 through 7), rebuttal
> showings are permitted at both A/B MAC (A) determination levels under
> 42 CFR 405, Subpart G (i.e., a rebuttal showing regarding the status
> of a prior SNF stay is made at the time that an inpatient claim is
> submitted and/or at the reconsideration level). A/B MACs (A) evaluate
> rebuttal documentation even if the presumption being rebutted was
> triggered by a Medicaid denial.

> This special rule for determining whether a beneficiary in a SNF is an

> the pro rata amount is to provide beneficiaries who are enrolled in
> managed care plans the benefit of assuming they have paid their
> deductible as if they were not enrolled in a managed care plan. The
> pro rata amount does not apply only to just the first two months of
> the year but rather for the number of months after first enrollment in
> a managed care plan that is necessary to cover the Part B deductible.
> Each year starts the deduction for the pro rata amount over again.

# - Part B Coinsurance

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> After the deductible has been satisfied, coinsurance of 20 percent is
> usually applicable.
>
> For providers and suppliers that bill A/B MAC(A) or (HHH), the 20
> percent may be based on the allowed amount, billed charges, or a
> preset rate per service (APC), depending upon the type of service. See
> Claims Processing instructions for a description of coinsurance
> calculation for each benefit type.
>
> Physicians and other suppliers will be paid 80 percent of allowed
> amount under the fee schedule amounts or in some instances reasonable
> charges incurred during the balance of the calendar year. The patient
> is responsible for a coinsurance amount equal to 20 percent of the fee
> schedule amounts or reasonable charges for the items and services.
> (See [§20.4](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/#20.4) of this
> chapter for exceptions.)

# - Exceptions to Annual Deductible and Coinsurance

## (Rev. 11, Issued: 10-22-04, Effective: 11-22-04, Implementation: 11-22-04)

> There is no deductible for screening mammography effective for
> services January 1, 1998 and later.
>
> Neither the annual deductible nor the 20 percent coinsurance apply
> with respect to:

-   Parts A and B home health services, except that there is a
    coinsurance of 20 percent of the payment amount for supplies, drugs,
    DME and prosthetics

> /orthotics furnished as a home health benefit;

# - Applications of Deductible and Coinsurance in Liability and Indemnification Situations

## (Rev. 12, Issued: 10-22-04, Effective: 04-01-05, Implementation: 04-04-05)

> Under 1879 of the Act, a beneficiary is not responsible for payment of
> the Part B deductible or coinsurance for items or services that are
> neither reasonable and necessary to diagnose or treat the illness or
> injury, nor to improve the functioning of a malformed body member. If
> the provider knew, or should have known, that Medicare considered such
> services medically unnecessary, but failed to inform the beneficiary
> before furnishing them, the provider is held liable for their cost. If
> the beneficiary made payment for such items or services, he/she can be
> indemnified for them.
>
> In most cases, however, funds can be collected while awaiting the
> outcome of review of a demand bill for institutional services\-- See
> Publication 100-04, Chapter 1, §60.3, See

# - Blood Deductibles (Part A and Part B)

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Program payment may not be made for the first 3 pints of whole blood
> or equivalent units of packed red cells received under Part A and Part
> B combined in a calendar year.
>
> However, blood processing (e.g., administration, storage) is not
> subject to the deductible.
>
> The blood deductibles are in addition to any other applicable
> deductible and coinsurance amounts for which the patient is
> responsible.
>
> The deductible applies only to the first 3 pints of blood furnished in
> a calendar year, even if more than one provider furnished blood.

# - Part A Blood Deductible

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Blood must be furnished on a Medicare covered day in a hospital or SNF
> to be counted under Part A. Blood furnished to an inpatient after
> benefits exhausted or before entitlement is not counted toward the
> combined deductible. Blood furnished during a lifetime extension
> election period is counted toward the combined A/B 3 pint total.

# - Part B Blood Deductible

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Blood is furnished on an outpatient basis or is subject to the Part B
> blood deductible and is counted toward the combined limit. It should
> be noted that payment for blood may be made to the hospital under Part
> B only for blood furnished in an outpatient setting. Blood is not
> covered for inpatient Part B services.

# - Items Subject to Blood Deductibles

## (Rev. 18, Issued: 03-04-05, Effective: 07-01-05, Implementation: 07-05-05)

> The blood deductibles apply only to whole blood and packed red cells.
> The term whole blood means human blood from which none of the liquid
> or cellular components have been removed. Where packed red cells are
> furnished, a unit of packed red cells is considered equivalent to a
> pint of whole blood. Other components of blood such as platelets,
> fibrinogen, plasma, gamma globulin, and serum albumin are not subject
> to the blood deductible. However, these components of blood are
> covered as biologicals.
>
> Refer to Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, chapter 4,
> §231 regarding billing for blood and blood products under the Hospital
> Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS).

# - Obligations of the Beneficiary to Pay for or Replace Deductible Blood

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> A provider may charge the beneficiary or a third party its customary
> charge for whole blood or units of packed red cells which are subject
> to either the Part A or Part B blood deductible, unless the
> individual, another person, or a blood bank replaces the blood or
> arranges to have it replaced.

# - Replacement of Blood

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> For replacement purposes, a pint of whole blood is considered
> equivalent to a unit of packed red cells. A deductible pint of whole
> blood or unit of packed red cells is considered replaced when a
> medically acceptable pint or unit is given or offered to the provider
> or, at the provider\'s request, to its blood supplier. Accordingly,
> where an individual or a blood bank offers blood as a replacement for
> a deductible pint or unit furnished a Medicare beneficiary, the
> provider may not charge the beneficiary for the blood, whether or not
> the provider or its blood supplier accepts the replacement offer. Thus
> a provider may not charge a beneficiary merely because it is the
> policy of the provider or its blood supplier not to accept blood from
> a particular source which has offered to replace blood on behalf of
> the beneficiary. However, a provider would not be barred from charging
> a beneficiary for deductible blood, if there is a reasonable basis for
> believing that replacement blood offered by or on behalf of the
> beneficiary would endanger the health of a recipient or that the
> prospective donor\'s health would be endangered by making a blood
> donation. Once a provider accepts a pint of replacement
>
> blood from a beneficiary or another individual acting on his/her
> behalf, the blood is deemed to have been replaced, and, the
> beneficiary may not be charged for the blood, even though the
> replacement blood is later found to be unfit and has to be discarded.
>
> When a provider accepts blood donated in advance, in anticipation of
> need by a specific beneficiary, whether the beneficiary\'s own blood,
> that is, an autologous donation, or blood furnished by another
> individual or blood assurance group, such donations are considered
> replacement for pints or units subsequently furnished the beneficiary.

# -- Part B Premium

# 30 - Outpatient Mental Health Treatment Limitation

## (Rev. 60, Issued: 10-30-09, Effective: 01-01-10, Implementation: 01-04-10)

> Regardless of the actual expenses a beneficiary incurs in connection
> with the treatment of mental, psychoneurotic, and personality
> disorders while the beneficiary is not an inpatient of a hospital at
> the time such expenses are incurred, the amount of those expenses that
> may be recognized for Part B deductible and payment purposes is
> limited to 62.5 percent of the Medicare approved amount for those
> services. The limitation is called the outpatient mental health
> treatment limitation (the limitation). The 62.5 percent limitation has
> been in place since the inception of the Medicare Part B program and
> it will remain effective at this percentage amount until January 1,
> 2010. However, effective January 1, 2010, through January 1, 2014, the
> limitation will be phased out as follows:

-   January 1, 2010 -- December 31, 2011, the limitation percentage is
    68.75%. (Medicare pays 55% and the patient pays 45%).

-   January 1, 2012 -- December 31, 2012, the limitation percentage is
    75%. (Medicare pays 60% and the patient pays 40%).

-   January 1, 2013 -- December 31, 2013, the limitation percentage is
    81.25%. (Medicare pays 65% and the patient pays 35%).

-   January 1, 2014 -- onward, the limitation percentage is 100%.
    (Medicare pays 80% and the patient pays 20%).

> For additional details concerning the outpatient mental health
> treatment limitation, please see the Medicare Claims Processing
> Manual, Publication 100-04, chapter 9, section 60 and chapter 12,
> section 210.
