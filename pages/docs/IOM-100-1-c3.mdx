10. # - Hospital Insurance (Part A)

    1.  []{#_bookmark2 .anchor}**- Inpatient Hospital Deductible**

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The patient is responsible for a deductible amount for inpatient
> hospital services in each benefit period. For each year after 1991,
> the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is
> required to set the deductible and coinsurance amounts between
> September 1 and September 15 of the preceding year. The deductible
> will be set at an amount equal to the deductible for the preceding
> year, changed by the same percentage as applies to PPS payment rates,
> and adjusted to reflect changes in real case mix. The deductible and
> coinsurance amounts are shown in the chart in
> [ยง10.3](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/#10.3) of this chapter.
>
> The coinsurance amount is based on the deductible applicable for the
> calendar year in which the coinsurance days occur. The deductible is
> satisfied only by charges for covered Part A services. Expenses for
> covered services count toward the deductible on an incurred, rather
> than paid, basis. Expenses incurred in one benefit period cannot be
> applied toward the deductible in a later benefit period. Expenses
> incurred in meeting the blood deductible do not count toward the
> inpatient hospital deductible.
>
> A reduction in benefit days resulting from confinement in a
> psychiatric hospital, on and immediately preceding the date of
> entitlement, does not affect the amount of the deductible for which
> the patient is responsible.
>
> If the actual charge is less than the deductible and the customary
> charge, the customary charge is applied to the deductible.
>
> A beneficiary is not responsible for payment of the deductible for an
> inpatient stay if the provider has been determined to be liable
> because the care was not medically necessary or because the care
> provided was custodial.

# - Coinsurance

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The following subsections describe coinsurance.

# - Inpatient Services

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> In each benefit period, the patient is responsible for coinsurance
> amounts equal to:

-   One-fourth of the inpatient hospital deductible for each day of
    inpatient hospital services from the 61st through the 90th days;

-   One-half of the inpatient hospital deductible for each lifetime
    reserve day (the 91st through the 150th days of inpatient hospital
    services); and

-   One-eighth of the inpatient hospital deductible for each day of
    extended care services from the 21st through the 100th days. A
    beneficiary is not responsible for payment of the coinsurance for a
    stay if the provider has been determined to be liable because the
    care was not medically necessary or because the care provided was
    custodial.

> Use the chart in [ยง10.3](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/#10.3)
> of this chapter to determine the applicable coinsurance amounts.
>
> Where the actual charge to the patient for the 61st through the 90th
> days of inpatient hospital services is less than the applicable
> coinsurance amount, the coinsurance is the actual charge per day.
> Where the actual charge to the patient for lifetime reserve days is
> less than the coinsurance amount for those days, the
>
> beneficiary may be deemed to have elected not to use the days because
> he/she would not benefit from their utilization.

# - Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Furnished as a Home Health Benefit

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The patient is responsible for 20 percent of the payment amount for
> DME furnished as a home health benefit.

# - Basis for Determining the Part A Coinsurance Amounts

### *(Rev. 11641; Issued:10-13-2022; Effective: 01-10-2023; Implementation: 01-03-2023)*

> The applicable inpatient deductible is the one in effect during the
> calendar year in which the patient\'s benefit period begins (i.e., in
> most cases, the year in which the first inpatient hospital services
> are furnished in the benefit period). Except for 1989, the coinsurance
> amount is based on the deductible applicable for the calendar year in

1.  Coinsurance was not charged for inpatient hospital care in CY 1989
    due to Catastrophic Coverage. The deductible was applied.

2.  Under Catastrophic Coverage, a coinsurance payment of \$25.50 was
    due for days 1-8 of SNF care. No SNF coinsurance was due after day 8
    in 1989.

    1.  # - Benefit Period (Spell of Illness)

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> A benefit period is a period of time for measuring the use of hospital
> insurance benefits. It is a period of consecutive days during which
> covered services furnished to a patient, up to certain specified
> maximum amounts, may be paid for by the hospital insurance plan.
>
> For example, a patient is eligible for 90 days of hospital care in a
> benefit period and 100 days of extended care services during the same
> benefit period. A patient may be eligible for as many as l50 days of
> hospital care in a benefit period if he/she draws on his/her lifetime
> reserve. As long as a person continues to be entitled to hospital
> insurance, there is no limit on the number of benefit periods he/she
> may have. The term \"benefit period\" is synonymous with spell of
> illness. Since the term \"spell of illness\" could connote a
>
> single illness or a particular \"spell\" of sickness, the term benefit
> period is used in communications with the public.

# - Starting a Benefit Period

## (Rev. 80, Issued: 10-26-12, Effective: 04-01-13, Implementation: 04-01-13)

> A benefit period begins with the first day (not included in a previous
> benefit period) on which a patient is furnished inpatient hospital or
> extended care services by a qualified provider in a month for which
> the patient is entitled to hospital insurance benefits.
>
> A provider qualified to start a benefit period is a hospital
> (including a psychiatric hospital) or SNF that meets all the
> requirements of the definition of such an institution. A hospital
> which meets all requirements in [Chapter 5,
> ยง20](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/ge101c05.asp#20) of this
> manual is also a qualified hospital for purposes of beginning a
> benefit period when it furnishes the patient covered inpatient
> emergency services. Thus, generally, the benefit period begins when
> covered inpatient services are initially furnished to an entitled
> individual. However, the noncovered services furnished by a
> nonparticipating provider can begin a spell of illness
>
> only if the provider is a qualified provider. A qualified provider is
> a hospital (including a psychiatric hospital) or a SNF which meets all
> requirements in the definition of such an institution even though it
> may not be participating. A qualified hospital in Canada or Mexico is
> also a qualified provider for purposes of beginning a benefit period
> when it furnishes covered inpatient hospital services. If a person is
> in a nonqualified institution and is subsequently transferred to a
> qualified hospital (general or psychiatric), his/her benefit period
> begins on admission to the qualified hospital.
>
> Admission to a qualified SNF or to the SNF level of care in a
> swing-bed hospital begins a benefit period even though payment for the

# - Ending a Benefit Period

## (Rev. 80, Issued: 10-26-12, Effective: 04-01-13, Implementation: 04-01-13)

> The benefit period ends with the close of a period of 60 consecutive
> days during which the patient was neither an inpatient of a hospital
> nor of a SNF. To determine the 60 consecutive day period, begin
> counting with the day the individual was discharged. (See
>
> [ยง10.4.3.2](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/#10.4.3.2) of this
> chapter for determining the end of a benefit period when an individual
> remains in a SNF.)
>
> As noted in section 10.4, the term "benefit period" is synonymous with
> spell of illness. However, the statutory language (at ยง1861(a) of the
> Social Security Act) that describes a benefit period as a "spell of
> illness" is sometimes misunderstood to mean that a benefit period is
> linked to a particular medical episode or type of condition, so that
> the onset of a new and entirely unrelated condition could serve to end
> a benefit period even in the absence of a 60-day break in the
> beneficiary's "inpatient" status. In fact, the onset of a new
> condition is not, in itself, relevant to the ending of a benefit
> period, which can occur **only** through a 60-day break in inpatient
> status, as described above.

# - Definition of Hospital or SNF for Ending a Benefit Period

## (Rev.10880, Issued: 08-06-21, Effective: 11-08- 21, Implementation: 11-08-21)

> It is important to note that a benefit period cannot end while a
> beneficiary is an inpatient (see ยง10.4.4) of an institution that meets
> the basic definition of a "hospital" at
>
> ยง1861(e)(1) of the Social Security Act (the Act), even if the hospital

# - Hospital Stay and End of Benefit Period

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> In order to end a benefit period, for at least 60 consecutive days, a
> beneficiary cannot have been in a hospital which meets the initial
> requirement in the definitions in
> [Chapter](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/ge101c05.asp#20.1)
> [5, ยง20.1](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/ge101c05.asp#20.1)
> through ยง20.7 of this publication. That is, the beneficiary cannot
> have been in a facility that is primarily engaged in providing, by or
> under the supervision of a physician(s), to inpatients:

-   Diagnostic and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis,
    treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons or
    rehabilitation services for injured, disabled, or sick persons; or

-   Psychiatric services for the diagnosis and treatment of mentally ill
    persons. A stay in a hospital outside the United States prolongs a
    benefit period. It may be assumed, in the absence of evidence to the
    contrary, that:

-   A foreign hospital in which a beneficiary spent one or more days
    meets the requirement of the definition in Chapter 5,
    [ยง20](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/#20) of this manual;
    and

-   The beneficiary\'s statement about length and place of stay is
    correct.

# - SNF Stay and End of Benefit Period

## (Rev.10880, Issued: 08-06-21, Effective: 11-08- 21, Implementation: 11-08-21

> Similarly, to end a benefit period, a beneficiary cannot have been an
> inpatient (see
>
> ยง10.4.4) of a SNF for at least 60 consecutive days; where SNF is
> defined in accordance with ยงยง1861(a)(2) and 1819(a)(1) of the Social
> Security Act as a facility which is primarily engaged in providing
> skilled nursing care and related services to residents who require
> medical or nursing care, or rehabilitation services for the
> rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons. As indicated
> above in ยง10.4.3, all Medicare-certified SNFs (including
> Medicare-certified distinct part SNFs) are automatically considered to
> meet this basic "SNF" definition by reason of the Medicare
> certification itself. See ยง2166 of the State Operations Manual (Pub.
> 100-07), Chapter 2, for the administrative criteria used in
> determining whether the basic "SNF" definition is met by a nursing
> home that is not Medicare-certified (including the noncertified
> portion of an institution that also contains a Medicare-certified
> distinct part SNF).
>
> Examples: An individual may be discharged from and readmitted to a
> hospital or SNF several times during a benefit period and still be in
> the same benefit period if 60 consecutive days have not elapsed
> between discharge and readmission. The stays need not be for related
> physical or mental conditions.
>
> Example 1: X was born 8/9/1936. On 7/28/2001, X entered a
> participating general hospital. After he/she had been in the hospital
> for 2 weeks, X was discharged on 8/11/2001. On his/her doctor's
> orders, X entered a participating SNF on 8/15/2001, and remained an
> inpatient there (see ยง10.4.4) until his/her discharge on 10/27/2001.
> He/she had no further inpatient stays in 2001.
>
> X's benefit period began on 8/1/2001, the first day of the month
> he/she attained age 65 and was entitled to hospital insurance. The
> benefit period ended 12/25/2001, the end of the 60-day period
> beginning with the date of his/her last discharge.
>
> Example 2: Y, over age 65, entered a participating general hospital on
> 8/28/2000 for treatment of a heart condition. He/she was discharged on
> 9/11/2000. On 10/3/2000, Y entered a Medicaid-only nursing facility,

>
> ยง10.4.4) until his/her discharge on 11/17/2000. On 12/26/2000, Y was
> again admitted to a participating hospital because of injuries

> further inpatient stays in 2001.
>
> Y's benefit period began on 8/28/2000. His/her stay in the nursing
> facility began less than 60 days after his/her hospital stay and the

> the day of last discharge.
>
> Example 3: Z, over age 65 and entitled to hospital insurance benefits,
> was admitted to General Hospital on 8/l/2000 and discharged on
> 8/10/2000, having received nonemergency hospital services. General
> Hospital met all the requirements in the definition of a hospital
> except those concerning utilization review and health and safety.
> While General Hospital met the minimum requirements of an emergency
> hospital, Z's benefit period did not begin with his/her admission to
> this hospital because:

1.  The hospital did not meet all of the requirements in the definition
    of a hospital; and

2.  Although the hospital satisfied the minimum requirements for
    coverage of emergency services, Z did not receive emergency
    inpatient care there.

> (As noted previously, a stay in an emergency hospital does not begin a
> benefit period unless it actually involves the receipt of covered
> inpatient emergency services; by contrast, even a nonemergency stay in
> such a hospital can serve as a qualifying hospital stay for purposes
> of coverage under the posthospital extended care benefit.) Z was
> admitted to Haven Convalescent Home on 8/20/2000 and remained an
> inpatient of the home (see ยง10.4.4) until his/her discharge on
> 3/1/2001. He/she had no further inpatient stays in 2001. Haven
> Convalescent Home became a participating SNF on 1/1/2001.
>
> Z\'s benefit period began 1/1/2001, the day Haven Convalescent Home
> was determined to be a qualified SNF. The services Z received from

> they were not covered and, therefore, not charged against Z's Medicare
> SNF utilization. (The services were not covered posthospital extended

> 30 days after discharge from the hospital.) Z's benefit period ended
> 4/29/2001, the end of the 60- day period beginning with the date of

# - Definition of Inpatient for Ending a Benefit Period

## (Rev. 80, Issued: 10-26-12, Effective: 04-01-13, Implementation: 04-01-13)

> Generally, a beneficiary is an inpatient of a hospital if the
> beneficiary is receiving inpatient services in the hospital (i.e., not
> on an outpatient basis). The type of care actually received is not
> relevant.
>
> However, a different definition of inpatient applies in determining
> the end of a benefit period for a beneficiary in a SNF, under which
> such a beneficiary is considered an inpatient in this context only if
> the beneficiary\'s care in the SNF meets certain skilled level of care
> standards. Specifically, the beneficiary must need and receive a
> skilled level of care while in the SNF.
>
> This means that in order to have been an "inpatient" for benefit
> period purposes while in a SNF, the beneficiary must have required and
> received skilled services on a daily basis which could, as a practical
> matter, only have been provided in a SNF on an inpatient basis. (Under
> the regulations at 42 CFR 409.60(b)(2), an additional level of care
> criterion at 42 CFR 409.31(b)(2)\--requiring that the SNF care must in
> some way relate back to a condition that was present during the
> beneficiary's qualifying hospital stay\--does not apply to benefit
> period determinations.) If these provisions were not met during the
> prior SNF stay, the beneficiary was not an inpatient of the SNF for
> purposes of prolonging the benefit period. Conversely, a beneficiary
> would remain an SNF "inpatient" in this context (thus prolonging his
> or her current benefit period) for as long as the beneficiary
> continues receiving a skilled level of care in the SNF\--even if Part
> A payment has ended due to the beneficiary's exhaustion of SNF
> benefits.
>
> Use the following presumptions for determining whether the skilled
> level of care standards were met during a prior SNF stay.
>
> Presumption 1: A beneficiary\'s care in a SNF met the skilled level of
> care standards if a Medicare SNF claim was paid for the care, unless
> such payment was made under limitation on liability rules.
>
> Presumption 2: A beneficiary\'s care in a SNF met the skilled level of
> care standards if a SNF claim was paid for the services provided in
> the SNF under the special Medicare limitation on liability rules
> pursuant to placement in a non-certified bed.
>
> Presumption 3: A beneficiary\'s care in a SNF did not meet the skilled
> level of care standards if a claim was paid for the services provided
> in the SNF pursuant to the general Medicare limitation on liability
> rules. (This presumption does not apply to placement in a
> non-certified bed. For claims paid under these special provisions, see
> Presumption 2.)
>
> Presumption 4: A beneficiary\'s care in a Medicaid nursing facility
> (NF) did not meet the skilled level of care standards if a Medicaid
> claim for the services provided in the NF was denied on the grounds
> that the services received were not at the NF level of care (even if
> paid under applicable Medicaid administratively necessary days
> provisions which result in payment for care not meeting the NF level
> of care requirements).
>
> Presumption 5: A beneficiary\'s care in a SNF met the skilled level of
> care standards if a Medicare SNF claim for the services provided in
> the SNF was denied on grounds other than that the services were not at
> the skilled level of care.
>
> Presumption 6: A beneficiary\'s care in a SNF did not meet the skilled
> level of care standards if a Medicare claim for the services provided
> in the SNF was denied on the grounds that the services were not at the
> skilled level of care and no limitation of liability payment was made.
>
> Presumption 7: A beneficiary\'s care in a SNF did not meet the skilled
> level of care standards if no Medicare or Medicaid claim was submitted
> by the SNF.
>
> Presumptions 1 through 4 cannot be rebutted. Thus, prior Medicare and
> Medicaid claim determinations that necessarily required a level of
> care determination for the time period under consideration are binding
> for purposes of a later benefit period calculation.
>
> Presumptions 5 through 7 can be rebutted by the beneficiary showing
> that the level of care needed or received is other than that which the
> presumption dictates.
>
> Presumption 6 can be rebutted because the Medicare skilled level of
> care definition for coverage purposes is broader than the skilled
> level of care definition used here for benefit period determinations.
> Specifically, the requirement referred to in Chapter 4,
> [ยง40.2](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/ge101c04.asp#40.2)
> regarding prior hospital care related to the SNF care is included in
> the Medicare SNF coverage requirements but is not included in the
> standard for benefit period determinations. Therefore, Medicare
> payment could have been denied for a SNF stay on level of care grounds
> (i.e., not even waiver payment was made) because of noncompliance with
> that requirement, even though skilled level of care requirements for
> benefit period determinations were in fact met by the SNF stay.
> Consequently, when Medicare SNF payment is denied on level of care
> grounds, the beneficiary must be given the opportunity to demonstrate
> that he/she still needed and received a skilled level of care for
> purposes of benefit period determinations.
>
> **NOTE:** Effective October 1, 1990, the levels of care that were
> previously covered separately under the Medicaid SNF and intermediate
> care facility (ICF) benefits are combined in a single Medicaid nursing
> facility (NF) benefit. Thus, the Medicaid NF benefit includes
> essentially the same type of skilled care covered by Medicare\'s SNF
> benefit, but it includes less intensive care as well. This means that
> when a person is found not to require at least a Medicaid NF level of
> care (as under Presumption 4), it can be presumed that he or she also
> does not meet the Medicare skilled level of care standards. However,
> since the NF benefit can include care that is less intensive than
> Medicare SNF care, merely establishing that a person does require NF
> level care does not necessarily mean that he or she also meets the
> Medicare skilled level of care standards.
>
> Determining whether an individual who requires NF level care also
> meets the Medicare skilled level of care standards requires an actual
> examination of the medical evidence and cannot be accomplished through
> the simple use of a presumption. Therefore, the previous references to
> Medicaid claims have been deleted from those presumptions which
> establish that an individual does meet the Medicare standards.
>
> Medicare no-payment bills submitted by a SNF result in Medicare
> program payment determinations (i.e., denials). Therefore, such
> no-payment bills trigger the appropriate presumptions. This also
> applies in any State where the Medicaid program utilizes no- payment
> bills which lead to Medicaid program payment determinations. If a SNF
> erroneously fails to submit a Medicare claim (albeit a no-pay claim)
> when Medicare rules require such submission, A/B MACs (A) request a
> SNF to submit one. Once the no-pay bill is submitted and denied, the
> applicable presumption (other than presumption 7) is
>
> triggered. If a patient is moving from a SNF level of care to a
> non-SNF level of care in a facility certified to provide SNF care,
> occurrence code 22 (date active care ended) is used to signify the
> beginning of the no-pay period on the bill and trigger the appropriate
> presumptions.
>
> Where the presumptions are rebuttable (i.e., 5 through 7), rebuttal
> showings are permitted at both A/B MAC (A) determination levels under
> 42 CFR 405, Subpart G (i.e., a rebuttal showing regarding the status

> The Part B deductible is split into pro rata amounts. The purpose of
> the pro rata amount is to provide beneficiaries who are enrolled in
> managed care plans the benefit of assuming they have paid their
> deductible as if they were not enrolled in a managed care plan. The
> pro rata amount does not apply only to just the first two months of
> the year but rather for the number of months after first enrollment in
> a managed care plan that is necessary to cover the Part B deductible.
> Each year starts the deduction for the pro rata amount over again.

# - Part B Coinsurance

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> After the deductible has been satisfied, coinsurance of 20 percent is
> usually applicable.
>
> For providers and suppliers that bill A/B MAC(A) or (HHH), the 20
> percent may be based on the allowed amount, billed charges, or a
> preset rate per service (APC), depending upon the type of service. See
> Claims Processing instructions for a description of coinsurance
> calculation for each benefit type.
>
> Physicians and other suppliers will be paid 80 percent of allowed
> amount under the fee schedule amounts or in some instances reasonable
> charges incurred during the balance of the calendar year. The patient
> is responsible for a coinsurance amount equal to 20 percent of the fee
> schedule amounts or reasonable charges for the items and services.
> (See [ยง20.4](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/101_general/#20.4) of this

# - Applications of Deductible and Coinsurance in Liability and Indemnification Situations

## (Rev. 12, Issued: 10-22-04, Effective: 04-01-05, Implementation: 04-04-05)

> Under 1879 of the Act, a beneficiary is not responsible for payment of
> the Part B deductible or coinsurance for items or services that are
> neither reasonable and necessary to diagnose or treat the illness or
> injury, nor to improve the functioning of a malformed body member. If
> the provider knew, or should have known, that Medicare considered such
> services medically unnecessary, but failed to inform the beneficiary
> before furnishing them, the provider is held liable for their cost. If
> the beneficiary made payment for such items or services, he/she can be
> indemnified for them.
>
> In most cases, however, funds can be collected while awaiting the

# - Blood Deductibles (Part A and Part B)

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Program payment may not be made for the first 3 pints of whole blood
> or equivalent units of packed red cells received under Part A and Part
> B combined in a calendar year.
>
> However, blood processing (e.g., administration, storage) is not
> subject to the deductible.
>
> The blood deductibles are in addition to any other applicable
> deductible and coinsurance amounts for which the patient is
> responsible.
>
> The deductible applies only to the first 3 pints of blood furnished in
> a calendar year, even if more than one provider furnished blood.

# - Part A Blood Deductible

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Blood must be furnished on a Medicare covered day in a hospital or SNF
> to be counted under Part A. Blood furnished to an inpatient after
> benefits exhausted or before entitlement is not counted toward the
> combined deductible. Blood furnished during a lifetime extension
> election period is counted toward the combined A/B 3 pint total.

# - Part B Blood Deductible

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Blood is furnished on an outpatient basis or is subject to the Part B
> blood deductible and is counted toward the combined limit. It should
> be noted that payment for blood may be made to the hospital under Part
> B only for blood furnished in an outpatient setting. Blood is not
> covered for inpatient Part B services.

# - Items Subject to Blood Deductibles

## (Rev. 18, Issued: 03-04-05, Effective: 07-01-05, Implementation: 07-05-05)

> The blood deductibles apply only to whole blood and packed red cells.
> The term whole blood means human blood from which none of the liquid
> or cellular components have been removed. Where packed red cells are
> furnished, a unit of packed red cells is considered equivalent to a
> pint of whole blood. Other components of blood such as platelets,
> fibrinogen, plasma, gamma globulin, and serum albumin are not subject
> to the blood deductible. However, these components of blood are
> covered as biologicals.
>
> Refer to Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, chapter 4,
> ยง231 regarding billing for blood and blood products under the Hospital
> Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS).

# - Obligations of the Beneficiary to Pay for or Replace Deductible Blood

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> A provider may charge the beneficiary or a third party its customary
> charge for whole blood or units of packed red cells which are subject
> to either the Part A or Part B blood deductible, unless the
> individual, another person, or a blood bank replaces the blood or
> arranges to have it replaced.

# - Replacement of Blood

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> For replacement purposes, a pint of whole blood is considered
> equivalent to a unit of packed red cells. A deductible pint of whole
> blood or unit of packed red cells is considered replaced when a
> medically acceptable pint or unit is given or offered to the provider
> or, at the provider\'s request, to its blood supplier. Accordingly,
> where an individual or a blood bank offers blood as a replacement for
> a deductible pint or unit furnished a Medicare beneficiary, the
> provider may not charge the beneficiary for the blood, whether or not
> the provider or its blood supplier accepts the replacement offer. Thus
> a provider may not charge a beneficiary merely because it is the
> policy of the provider or its blood supplier not to accept blood from
> a particular source which has offered to replace blood on behalf of
> the beneficiary. However, a provider would not be barred from charging
> a beneficiary for deductible blood, if there is a reasonable basis for
> believing that replacement blood offered by or on behalf of the
> beneficiary would endanger the health of a recipient or that the
> prospective donor\'s health would be endangered by making a blood
> donation. Once a provider accepts a pint of replacement
>
> blood from a beneficiary or another individual acting on his/her
> behalf, the blood is deemed to have been replaced, and, the
> beneficiary may not be charged for the blood, even though the
> replacement blood is later found to be unfit and has to be discarded.
>
> When a provider accepts blood donated in advance, in anticipation of
> need by a specific beneficiary, whether the beneficiary\'s own blood,
> that is, an autologous donation, or blood furnished by another
> individual or blood assurance group, such donations are considered
> replacement for pints or units subsequently furnished the beneficiary.

# -- Part B Premium

### *(Rev. 11641; Issued:10-13-2022; Effective: 01-10-2023; Implementation: 01-03-2023)*

# 30 - Outpatient Mental Health Treatment Limitation

## (Rev. 60, Issued: 10-30-09, Effective: 01-01-10, Implementation: 01-04-10)

> Regardless of the actual expenses a beneficiary incurs in connection
> with the treatment of mental, psychoneurotic, and personality
> disorders while the beneficiary is not an inpatient of a hospital at
> the time such expenses are incurred, the amount of those expenses that
> may be recognized for Part B deductible and payment purposes is
> limited to 62.5 percent of the Medicare approved amount for those
> services. The limitation is called the outpatient mental health
> treatment limitation (the limitation). The 62.5 percent limitation has
> been in place since the inception of the Medicare Part B program and
> it will remain effective at this percentage amount until January 1,
> 2010. However, effective January 1, 2010, through January 1, 2014, the
> limitation will be phased out as follows:

-   January 1, 2010 -- December 31, 2011, the limitation percentage is
    68.75%. (Medicare pays 55% and the patient pays 45%).

-   January 1, 2012 -- December 31, 2012, the limitation percentage is
    75%. (Medicare pays 60% and the patient pays 40%).

-   January 1, 2013 -- December 31, 2013, the limitation percentage is
    81.25%. (Medicare pays 65% and the patient pays 35%).

-   January 1, 2014 -- onward, the limitation percentage is 100%.
    (Medicare pays 80% and the patient pays 20%).

> For additional details concerning the outpatient mental health
> treatment limitation, please see the Medicare Claims Processing
> Manual, Publication 100-04, chapter 9, section 60 and chapter 12,
