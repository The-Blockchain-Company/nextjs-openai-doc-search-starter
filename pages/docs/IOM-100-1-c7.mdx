> CMS has the responsibility for the development and implementation of
> standards and programs for the economical management of records under
> the health insurance program. Specifically, CMS is required to provide
> for effective controls over the creation of records, including the
> making of records containing adequate and proper documentation of the
> contractor\'s administration and operations. Each contractor is
> required to establish and maintain an active, continuing program for
> the economical and efficient management of the records outlined in
> [[§30.20]{.underline}](#implementing-a-files-management-program).
>
> The contractor\'s programs must provide for:

-   Effective controls over the creation, the organization, maintenance
    and use, and disposition of all CMS health insurance claims and
    non-claims records; and

-   Development and application of standards, procedures, and techniques
    designed to assure the maintenance and security of records of
    continuing value and facilitate the disposal of all records of
    temporary value.

> The contractor provides for the continued analysis and improvement of
> record classification and indexing systems, the use of filing
> equipment and supplies, and the reproduction and transportation of
> records. The contractor assures that records are maintained
> economically and efficiently for maximum usefulness.
>
> The files established by the contractor, and all records and
> procedures documenting its programs for controlling the creation,
> maintenance, and use of current records, for the selective retention
> of records of continuing value, and for the disposal of noncurrent
> records, must be available for periodic review by CMS.

## - Description of Records Maintained

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06)

A.  **Claims Records**

> These are Government records including Government-issued standard
> forms and other forms, documents, and statements needed to support
> claims. Such records are maintained by the
>
> contractor in accordance with instructions regarding retention,
> transfer, destruction, and other disposition of claims materials. (See
> [[§§30.30]{.underline}](#record-retention-and-disposal-schedule) and
> [[30.40]{.underline}](#rev.-124-issued-05-17-19-effective-06-18-19-implementation-06-18-19-1).)

### Non-Claims Records

> These include materials not needed as supporting documentation of a
> claim, such as used work sheets, extra copies of documents, retained
> CMS bill copies where records were submitted on tape, used punched
> cards, EDP listings, used paper tape, and general correspondence not
> related to specific pending or processed claims. See
> [§30.30]{.underline} for the records retention and disposal schedule
> and §30.70 for the disposition of such material.

### Fiscal and Administrative Records

> These include records that are not included as claims or non-claims
> records. See [§30.70]{.underline} for the records retention and
> disposal schedule.

### Microform Records

> This is a term used for any form containing micro-images (e.g.,
> microfilm, microfiche). If records are microfilmed, the original
> records must still be retained.

### Scanned/Imaged Records

> This is a term used for any information that is recorded in a form
> that only a computer can process. This is the preferred format when
> paper records are not retained. The image becomes the "official
> record/recordkeeping copy" which must be retained in accordance with
> directives from CMS.

## - Definition of a Record

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06)

> Records are basically files consisting of papers, folders,
> photographs, photographic copies, magnetic tapes, or other recorded
> information regardless of physical form or characteristics,
> accumulated or maintained in filing equipment, boxes, disks, CDs or
> shelves, and occupying office or storage space. Stocks of publications
> and blank forms are not included in this definition.

## 30.20 - Implementing a Files Management Program

### (Rev. 124, Issued: 05-17-19, Effective: 06-18-19, Implementation: 06-18-19

> The term Medicare beneficiary identifier (Mbi) is a general term
> describing a beneficiary\'s Medicare identification number. For
> purposes of this manual, Medicare beneficiary identifier references
> both the Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) and the Medicare
> Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) during the new Medicare card transition
> period and after for certain business areas that will continue to use
> the HICN as part of their processes.
>
> Adequate records management controls over the creation of contractor
> files must insure that important policies and decision are adequately
> recorded, routine operational paper work is kept to a minimum, and the
> accumulation of unnecessary files is prevented. Effective techniques
> in
>
> this area include the application of systems for the control of
> correspondence and forms, the minimizing of duplicate files, and the
> disposal without filing of transitory material that has no value for
> record purposes.
>
> CMS expects each contractor to establish an appropriate program for
> the management of its files. The following actions are generally basic
> to such a files management program.

A.  Standardize classification and filing schemes to:

    1.  Achieve maximum uniformity and ease in maintaining and using
        program records;

    2.  Facilitate disposal of records in accordance with applicable
        records disposal schedules;

> and

3.  Facilitate possible later consolidation of identical type files
    presently maintained at different locations.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
B.  Formally authorize official file locations. Prohibit the maintenance
    of files at other than authorized locations.

C.  Standardize reference service procedures to facilitate the finding,
    charge-out, and refiling of records.

D.  File accumulations of papers received at file locations on a daily
    basis.

E.  Audit periodically a representative sample of the files for
    duplication, misclassification, or misfiles. In addition to the
    above, the contractor\'s program must:

    1.  Establish and implement standards and procedures issued by CMS.
        Such CMS standards and procedures relate to:

        a.  Classifying, indexing, and filing records;

        b.  Providing reference services to filed records;

        c.  Locating active files to facilitate use of the records; and

        d.  Reviewing the program periodically to determine the adequacy
            > of the system and its effectiveness in meeting requests.

    2.  Ensure that the standards, guides, and instructions developed
        for the files management program are readily available to all
        employees concerned with the files operations. In addition, give
        pertinent information for users of files and references services
        the widest possible dissemination.

    3.  File accumulations of papers received at file locations on a
        daily basis.

    4.  Audit periodically a representative sample of the files for
        duplications, misclassification, or misfiles.

> The methods used in maintaining, using, and disposing of these files
> vary with the contractor. Variations depend on the filing and control
> methods established (e.g., provider number, Medicare beneficiary
> identifier, date, name, or other sequence) to record requests from
> providers; to furnish replies; to check on overdue cases; to control
> cases for completion of processing; to control cases requiring some
> type of investigation or additional documentation; to retain completed
> cases for history or other reference; to maintain for audits; and to
> schedule for transfer to other storage areas. Other variances may be
> due to computer or clerical practices; workload volume; review
> initiated at time of notice of admission, at time of start of care, at
> time of request for advance payment or at time of receipt of billing
> form; and other considerations.

## - Record Retention and Disposal Schedule

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06)

> This schedule identifies those records accumulated by the contractor
> in administering the Medicare program and outlines the disposal
> schedule for each type of record.
>
> A freeze has been imposed on the destruction of Medicare records. No
> paper Medicare records can be destroyed unless they are electronically
> imaged. If Medicare records are not imaged, the original paper
> document must be retained. A contractor who images paper Medicare
> records:

A.  Must always be able to demonstrate the imaged version is an exact
    copy of the paper document,

B.  Document the steps taken to image the original document,

C.  Establish and implement a certification/quality assurance process to
    ensure the imaged information is an identical replication of the
    paper document in every way,

D.  Retain the scanned image as the "recordkeeping copy" for the
    required retention period, and

E.  Maintain accessibility and the ability to read the document in
    accordance with changes in technology.

> The methods used in imaging files may vary with the contractor. These
> variations depend on the type of equipment used and methods used to
> prepare documents for imaging. All imaged documents shall be tamper
> proof. Once an image is verified as an exact copy of the original
> paper document, only then can the original paper document be destroyed
> and the imaged copy is certified as the "recordkeeping copy".
>
> Certifying images as an exact copy of the paper document means there
> is a \"quality assurance\" process in place that verifies that the
> images are good. Each contractor is responsible for establishing their
> own \"quality assurance\" procedures.
>
> Below is an example of a certification/quality assurance process.

1.  The staff member performing the actual scan will:

    a.  Observe that all pages successfully pass through scanner and
        > that image displayed on the imaging software preview screen
        > appear accurate.

    b.  Affix a sticker marked "Scanned" to the top page, write the
        > current date on the sticker and place on top of a pile of
        > scanned material.

2.  The staff member(s) responsible for these records will have
    > immediate access to the images, from their desktops, using the
    > imaging software. They will have 30 days to use and review the
    > images. If any problem is detected, the paper will be retrieved
    > and rescanned. After 30 days, the paper copies are subject to
    > proper disposal.

> A contractor is authorized to cut off and transfer Medicare claims
> records and other records to inactive storage earlier than is
> prescribed in the disposal schedule shown below when the records are
> contained on microform. (See §§40.3 and .50ff. for guidelines on
> retention and disposition guidelines on microform copies of the
> following records.)
>
> The term \"cut off\" means the transfer of records to an inactive
> files area when there is no more than one reference to a file drawer
> per month. See [§§30.70]{.underline} for guidelines regarding the
> disposition of non-claims material not transferred to inactive
> storage.

## - Disposition Instructions - Destruction of Records

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06)

> In accordance with Federal regulations, 36 CFR 1228.58(b)-Destruction
> of Temporary Records,
> [[http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/36cfr1228_05.html]{.underline}](http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/36cfr1228_05.html)
> paper records to be disposed of normally must be sold as wastepaper.
> Because the records you maintain are considered restricted, you are
> required to pulp, macerate, shred, or otherwise definitely destroy the
> information contained in the records and their destruction must be
> witnessed by you who created the records or by a contractor employee
> [(see Exhibit 11, Witness Disposal Certification-Sample)]{.underline}.
> The contract for sale must prohibit the resale of all other paper
> records for use as records or documents. Regardless of medium, records
> other than paper records (e.g., audio, visual, data tapes, disks,
> diskettes, etc.) may be salvaged and sold in the same manner and under
> the same conditions as paper records.
>
> A Witness Disposal Certification must be completed and kept on file
> for 7 years.

## - Disposition Instructions When Operating Under a Freeze

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06)

> When operating under a freeze, you are prohibited from destroying
> records, and must follow the disposition instructions below in
> [[§30.30.1.2]{.underline}](#disposition-instructions-when-medicare-records-are-microfilmed).
> Only after the freeze has been lifted, can you revert back to the
> normal disposition instructions in
> [[§30.30.2.]{.underline}](#description-of-records)

## - Disposition Instructions When Medicare Records are Microfilmed

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06) Paper Records

> All paper claims that are microfilmed must be retained until CMS
> notifies you the freeze is lifted.

### Microform Records

> The master microform must be retained until CMS notifies you the
> freeze is lifted.

## - Disposition For Paper-Only Medicare Records

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06)

> The contractor cuts off the file at the close of the calendar year in
> which the claim was paid, then transfers the paper records to inactive
> storage. The paper records must be retained until CMS notifies you the
> freeze is lifted.

## - Disposition For Medicare Records that are Imaged/Scanned

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06) Paper

> Since imaging can be used to replace paper documents, only when the
> image will be [identical]{.underline} to the paper, you must
> image/scan both the front and the back of every document.

### There is an exception: Once the back of a claim form is imaged, you do not have to image the back of the rest of the documents imaged on that particular machine, as long as the backs are identical and a certified statement is kept on file stating "the remainder of the backs of the claim forms are identical". However, if the back of a claim form differs in any respect, it must be imaged.

> The contractor must retain the paper records until their
> certification/quality assurance process (see below) has been completed
> and the imaged information (the recordkeeping copy) is verified as an
> identical replication of the paper document. Only then can the paper
> records be destroyed.
>
> If a scanned document is not identical to the paper document, that
> paper document must be retained until the freeze is lifted.

### Imaged/Scanned Records

> Due to the freeze prohibiting the destruction of Medicare records, do
> not destroy any images of claims records. They are the recordkeeping
> copy and must be retained until CMS notifies you the freeze is lifted.
> Once the freeze is lifted, revert back to the normal disposition
> instructions in
>

## - Retention of Claims File Materials

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06)

> After the claims determination payment action and posting to CMS
> records is completed, the bills and related materials are accumulated
> in file segments and held before transfer to an approved offsite
> storage facility (see §30.40.2). Claims records having current value
> and continuing reference, or claims records otherwise flagged to
> indicate pending action, are retained as long as the A/B MAC (B) or
> DME MAC finds necessary.

## - Segment File Accumulation Period

### (Rev. 124, Issued: 05-17-19, Effective: 06-18-19, Implementation: 06-18-19

> The term Medicare beneficiary identifier (Mbi) is a general term
> describing a beneficiary\'s Medicare identification number. For
> purposes of this manual, Medicare beneficiary identifier references
> both the Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) and the Medicare
> Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) during the new Medicare card transition
> period and after for certain business areas that will continue to use
> the HICN as part of their processes.
>
> In order to facilitate the transfer of material to an approved offsite
> storage facility, MACs maintain the permanent claims records files in
> accumulation period segments, based on the starting date of initial
> payment or denial. Each contractor may select an accumulation period
> segment of from 6 months to 2 years in length after such starting
> date. The contractor may also adopt one period of time on an ongoing
> basis, but a different period for the initial segment.
>
> Contractors who have been authorized to microfilm/image claims records
> may be authorized to shorten the segment file accumulation period.
> (See [§30.50]{.underline}.)
>
> After a file segment is closed, the contractor retains the records
> contained in that segment until time to transfer them to an approved
> storage facility. (See
> §§[[30.40.2]{.underline}](#standard-retention-periods---microfilmed-claims)
> and [[30.40.3]{.underline}](#retention-period---microfilmed-material)
> for definition of retention periods.)
>
> **EXCEPTION:** Contractors who maintain total history files by
> individual Medicare beneficiary identifier, name, or other sequence,
> may wish to operate under some procedure other than by a file segment
> accumulation period.
>
> Such alternative procedures may be used provided purging techniques to
> withdraw inactive records are established which meet one of the
> following requirements:

1.  They avoid costly and time consuming manual selection of material to
    be purged from each folder.

2.  Separators are used for each year\'s (or other period\'s) material
    within the history folder to facilitate rapid selection.

3.  The capability exists (e.g., computer prepared lists) to identify
    inactive cases in which no action has been taken for 12 months or
    more for selection as purged segments to be transferred to an
    approved storage facility when such a purge becomes necessary.

4.  Periods for purging and transfer are carefully selected by studying
    rates of reference to claims materials in order to select a
    realistic inactive period to avoid unnecessary recall from the
    storage facility.

> Although contractors who follow a purging procedure need not establish
> a standard retention period, the establishment of one of these
> requirements provides them with the potential of transferring inactive
> files to a storage facility if such a transfer should become
> desirable. When such a purge is begun, the contractor should make no
> transfer to the storage facility until the entire purging operation
> for the period is completed.

## - Standard Retention Periods - Microfilmed Claims

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06)

> Contractors keep each permanent claims records file segment for a
> period of not less than 6 months or more than 1 1/2 years after the
> segment has been closed. The contractor bases the selection of a
> retention period on its experience with the rate and frequency of
> reference and other criteria. It also should avoid too early transfer
> to the storage facility, which could result in volume recalls and
> delays. The contractor bases the exact length of the retention period
> on its needs and on the arrangements worked out with the storage
> facility.
>
> The following examples of segment accumulation and retention periods
> demonstrate some of the ways in which these periods can vary.

## - Microfilming of Files Material

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06)

> Some MACs have been authorized to microfilm claims records and other
> files material; e.g., computer printouts, cancelled checks, financial
> records. Due to the document freeze, these contractors are not
> authorized to destroy original source documents but are permitted to
> transfer an accumulation of these documents to an offsite storage
> facility after microfilming and verification of the quality and
> completeness of the film. (See §[30.30.2]{.underline}, item 3,
> concerning destruction the hard copy Medicare Summary Notices after
> microfilming.) The accumulation period may be daily, weekly, or
> monthly, depending on volume. Generally, contractors should not make
> shipments of less than three cartons. They coordinate transfer
> procedures with the storage facility.
>
> In [[§30.90]{.underline},](#exhibits) Exhibits 6-12 contain various

> authenticity at the start and at the end of the filmed documents.
> (Material other than claims records need not be authenticated.) The
> contractor
>
> produces these certificates and target cards as needed, using the
> language contained in the examples in §80, [Exhibits
> 6-12.]{.underline} The camera operator completes a report for each
> roll that is microfilmed. See [Exhibit 12]{.underline}, for an example
> of a roll report. The contractor films claims records without
> attachments (e.g., coding sheets) overlaying data on the record. If
> data on the attachment is needed for reference purpose, the contractor
> films it separately.
>
> To ensure that the camera is working efficiently when files material
> is being microfilmed, the contractor films a microcopy resolution test
> chart on the first roll in the morning and the first roll in the
> afternoon. It gives these rolls priority processing so that any camera
> malfunction is discovered as soon as possible. [Exhibit
> 11]{.underline} provides an example of a resolution test chart that
> cannot be used for actual tests. Usable charts are available from
> microfilm suppliers.

### B - Normal Filming

> The contractor films the start certificate [(see Exhibit
> 5)]{.underline} after any target (or flash) cards that identify or
> index the documents on the film and before the records are filmed. It
> files the end certificate [(Exhibit 6)]{.underline} after the last
> document and before any end target card. It retains documents in the
> order they were filmed for ease in reviewing the processed microfilm.
>
> The following is an example of normal filming sequence:

### D - Filming Retakes and Additions

> When the processed microfilm roll is reviewed, some documents may be
> illegible or incorrectly photographed. Other documents may have been
> out of file or omitted at the time of the original microfilming. The
> contractor will re-photograph these documents and splice onto the
> front of the completed microfilm roll. If splicing is not practical,
> it will maintain the retakes and additions as a separate microfilm
> roll. It will photograph a start of retake or addition card [(Exhibit
> 8)]{.underline} immediately before the documents to be rephotographed
> or added. Photograph an end of retake or addition certificate
> [(Exhibit 9)]{.underline} immediately after the last document to be
> rephotographed. The following is an example of retake or addition
> filming sequence:

## - Microfilming Index Label

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06)

> Affix an index label to each contents of the roll microfilm and
> provide reference markers. It lists the normal filming and the retakes
> and additions.
>
> Below is an example of an index label:

## - Retention and Destruction of Microfilm

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06) A - Master Microfilm

> After producing the number of copies of the microfilm required for
> reference purposes, the contractor retains the master microfilm as a
> security file. It stores it at an offsite location so that copies may
> be made in the event the reference copies are destroyed. It disposes
> of the master microfilm at the time the storage facility disposes of
> the hardcopy contained on the film. (See
>
> [§30.30]{.underline} for records disposition instructions.)
>
> (The contractor need not maintain a master microfilm security file of
> records such as computer printouts when complete computerized backup
> data is retained. It disposes of the master microfilm when there is no
> longer a need to produce reference copies of the microfilm.)

### B - Copies of Microfilm

> The contractor retains one copy of the microfilm as a reference copy
> to be kept on site for use when needed. It disposes of this copy with
> the master microfilm. (See subsection A above.)
>
> The contractor may dispose of any other reference copies of the
> microfilm 2 years after the end of the calendar year in which the
> documents were filmed. These copies may be retained for a longer
> period if they are needed for reference purposes but not longer than
> the master microfilm.

### C - Destruction of Microfilm

> The contractor should destroy microfilm by shredding as this method
> provides the most complete destruction of the data on the film. Other
> methods of destroying film, e.g., exposure to extreme heat or boiling,
> do not eradicate the data as completely or efficiently. Shredders
> exist that can destroy both film and reels. The contractor should
> retain cartridges or magazines which contained the microfilm for reuse
> because of the high cost of replacement.
>
> If a contractor does not have a shredder and purchase of a shredder is
> not cost justified, it should check local sources such as microfilm
> equipment vendors, microfilm service bureaus, banks, and insurance
> companies for a shredder that it can use to destroy its film. If a
> shredder cannot be located, the contractor should contact its regional
> office for assistance.

## 30.60 - Annual Report of Medicare Records

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06)

> The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) conducts a
> reporting of total records on hand in current file rooms, offices, and
> offsite storage facilities. Since Medicare claims records and related
> records created and maintained by you must be included, you must
> prepare an Annual Report of Medicare Records [(See Exhibit
> 13)]{.underline}.
>
> Each contractor shall prepare this report every year as of September
> 15, regardless of your fiscal year ending date, and mail one copy to
> reach the address shown below no later than September 30:
>
> Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Records Officer, OSORA/IRMG
>
> Mail Stop, SL-12-16 7500 Security Boulevard
>
> Baltimore, MD 21244-1850

## 30.70 - Disposition of Non-Claims Materials

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06)

> Non-claims materials, as defined in
> [[§30.10.1B]{.underline},](#description-of-records-maintained) may be
> disposed of by the contractor. Retained CMS bill copies (where records
> were submitted on tape) may be destroyed.
>
> In disposing of this material, the contractor must:

-   Ensure the confidentiality of information regarding a particular
    beneficiary, provider, physician, or supplier by protective
    shredding, mutilation, or contractual provisions with the
    subcontractor regarding similar protective measures.

-   Provide for offsetting expenditures with salvage value received when
    contractual relationships have been established with a local
    contractor for the sale of non-claims materials for its salvage
    value. In such cases, the contractor records the salvage value
    received, and offsets the initial expense of purchasing such
    materials by such value received.

## 30.80 - Standards for All Records Storage Facilities

### (Rev. 38, Issued: 05-26-06, Effective: 06-26-06, Implementation: 06-26-06)

> A facility that is used to store Federal records, must meet the
> minimum structural, environmental, property and life safety standards
> as outlined in 36 CFR 1228.228-Facility Requirements
> [[http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/36cfr1228_05.html]{.underline}](http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/36cfr1228_05.html)
> by October 1, 2009. You must submit a Facility Standards for Record
> Storage Facilities Inspection Checklist (see Exhibit 14) for all
> storage facilities used to house CMS records to the CMS Records
> Officer.
>
> The facility must be constructed with non-combustible materials and
> building elements, including walls, columns and floors. You may
> request a waiver of this requirement from the National Archives and
> Records Administration through CMS for an existing records facility
> with combustible building elements to continue to operate until
> October 1, 2009. Your request must provide documentation that the
> facility has a fire suppression system specifically designed to
> mitigate this hazard and that the system meets the requirements in 36
> CFR 1228.230\--Fire Safety Requirements
> [[http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/36cfr1228_05.html]{.underline}](http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/36cfr1228_05.html).
> Requests for waivers must be submitted to your CMS Regional Office
> contact who will forward to the CMS Records Officer for final approval
> by the National Archives and Records Administration.

## - Release Software

#### *(Rev.: 128, Issued: 11-01-19, Effective: 12-03-19, Implementation: 12-03-19)*

> Shared System Maintainers (SSMs) shall obtain approval from their
> Government Task Leader (GTL) before *quarterly release* software can
> be scheduled and installed.

### Control of System Changes

> SSMs shall use the same quarterly release schedule, (i.e., on or about
> October 1, January 1, April 1, and July 1). CMS will schedule each
> quarterly release.
>
> All follow-up release changes (except emergencies) to the quarterly
> schedule shall be held and released on a predetermined schedule in
> coordination with CMS. Unscheduled emergency changes released as
> problems are identified without prior approval. The schedule for a
> follow-up release of changes shall be forwarded to your GTL for prior
> approval.
>
> When a system problem is identified, Medicare contractors (i.e. SSMs,
> the STC, MACs and CWF Hosts) shall submit documentation to their GTL
> outlining the problem and the reason correction is needed at this
> time. Section V of this instruction outlines the minimum information
> required by CMS for approval.

### Problem Priority Classifications for Follow-Up Releases

> Listed below are CMS's problem priority classifications and examples.

### Priority 1 Classification

> Production:
>
> The problem prevents the accomplishment of a mission critical
> capability for which no acceptable workaround is known.\*
>
> This priority also includes problems where code shall be fixed
> immediately in order for the normal production region functions or
> services to continue. For example, if the production region is down in
> a job resulting in an incomplete cycle or the system is pricing a
> significant volume of claims incorrectly causing over or under
> payment. These corrections shall be reported to the GTL the next
> business day.

### EXAMPLES:

-   ABENDS on-line or batch (Inability to run a cycle)

-   Inaccurate payment or no payment of claims (significant impact/high
    > volume)

-   Necessary file updates cannot be accomplished (payment files,
    > history files)

-   Interface failures affecting claims processing Beta/User Acceptance
    Testing:

> The problem would prevent the accomplishment of a mission critical
> capability if the
>
> current test software is moved into the production environment. This
> priority also includes problems where code shall be fixed immediately
> in order for the normal test region functions or services to continue.
> For example, if the test region is down in a job causing the cycle to
> not complete or the system is pricing claims incorrectly with a
> potentially significant claim volume or payment impact, the issue
> would be classified as a priority 1.

### EXAMPLES:

-   ABENDS; inability to run a cycle or test

-   Inaccurate payment or no payment of claims (potentially significant
    > impact)

-   Necessary file updates cannot be accomplished (payment files,
    > history files)

-   Interface failures affecting test conditions

### Priority 2 Classification

> Production:
>
> The problem adversely affects the accomplishment of a mission critical
> capability so as to degrade performance and for which no acceptable
> work-around is known.\* This means the problem adversely affects the
> payment of benefits with a small claim volume or payment impact, the
> completion of CMS required reporting, or inaccurate information is
> being sent providers, beneficiaries or CMS. For example, if the
> information on an outgoing document to the provider community or
> Medicare Summary Notice is incorrect, the issue would be classified as
> a priority 2.

### EXAMPLES:

-   Inaccurate payment or no payment of claims (small impact/low volume)

-   Inaccurate CMS required report

-   Inaccurate messages to the beneficiary, provider or CMS

-   ABENDs with limited impact (e.g. one contractor) Beta/User
    Acceptance Testing:

> The problem would adversely affect the accomplishment of a mission
> critical capability so
>
> as to degrade performance if current test software is moved into the
> production environment. This means the problem adversely affects the
> payment of benefits with a potentially small claim volume or payment
> impact, the completion of CMS required reporting, or inaccurate
> information is being sent to providers, beneficiaries or CMS. For
> example, if the information on an outgoing document to the provider
> community is incorrect, the issue would be classified as a priority 2.

### EXAMPLES:

-   Inaccurate payment or no payment of claims (potentially small
    > impact)

-   Inaccurate CMS required report

-   Inaccurate messages to the beneficiary, provider or CMS

### Priority 3 Classification

> Production:
>
> The problem adversely affects the accomplishment of mission critical
> capability so as to degrade performance and for which an acceptable
> workaround is known.\*
>
> This means the problem could have significant impact but the
> work-around alleviates the impact. This allows the system maintainer
> adequate time to code a fix and sufficiently test before the corrected
> software is delivered for production installation.

### EXAMPLES:

-   Impact of problem could be significant or minimal

-   Problem correctable by contractor workaround\*

-   ABENDs with an acceptable workaround\* Beta/User Acceptance Testing:

> The problem would adversely impact the accomplishment of a mission
> critical capability so
>
> as to degrade performance if current test software is moved into the
> production environment.
>
> If moved into the production environment before correcting an
> acceptable workaround could be instituted to prevent the adverse
> impact. \*\*

### EXAMPLES:

-   Potential impact of problem could be significant or minimal

-   Problem affects CMS required reporting

### Priority 4 Classification

> Production:
>
> The problem is an operator inconvenience or annoyance, which does not
> affect a required mission essential capability.

### EXAMPLES:

-   Problems affects non-mission critical functions

-   Operational procedure with workload impact that should be automated

-   Impact of problem is minimal

-   Correctable by contractor workaround\* Beta/User Acceptance Testing:

> The problem is a test inconvenience or annoyance, which does not
> affect a required mission
>
> essential or test capability. If moved into the production environment
> before correcting, an acceptable workaround could be instituted to
> prevent the inconvenience. \*\*

### EXAMPLES:

-   Problem affects non-mission critical functions

-   Operational procedure with workload impact that should be automated

-   Impact of problem is minimal

-   Correctable by contractor workaround\*

### Priority 5 Classification

> Production:
>
> All other documented system problems. These could include operator
> errors, an inability to reproduce the reported problem, a problem with
> insufficient information, or documentation errors. The system
> maintainer should request approval from the (GTL) before coding and
> implementing any system enhancements.

### EXAMPLES:

-   A/B and DME MACs requested enhancements

-   Documentation errors

-   Problem affects non-mission critical functions

-   Minimal impact

> Beta/User Acceptance Testing:
>
> All other documented system test problems. These could include
> operator errors, an inability to reproduce the reported problem, a
> problem with insufficient information, or test documentation errors.
> The system maintainer should work to correct these issues as soon as
> possible but any system enhancements should be discussed with the GTL.

### EXAMPLES:

-   Test region or processing enhancements

-   Test documentation

-   Problem affects non-mission critical test functions

-   Minimal impact

> \* An acceptable workaround is a temporary alternative solution to a
> confirmed problem in the shared system that will ensure the contractor
> is able to accomplish a mission critical capability. What makes the
> workaround "acceptable" is it shall be agreeable to both the
> maintainer and contractor and does not cause an excessive burden to
> the contractor. If the maintainer and A/B and DME MACs cannot come to
> an agreement on what is "acceptable" the decision will be made by CMS.

## - Implementing Validated Workarounds for Shared System Claims Processing by All Medicare DME MACs

### (Rev. 97, Issued: 01-15-16, Effective: 09-21-15, Implementation: 09-21-15)

> Medicare A/B, DME contractors shall implement workarounds within the
> shared systems for problems when formally defined as a Priority 3 or
> Priority 4 without obtaining written permission from a Project Officer
> or Regional Office.
>
> Shared system problems that are formally defined as a Priority 3 or a
> Priority 4 have acceptable workarounds which provide temporarily
> alternative solutions. In order for a A/B/DME MACs to implement a
> workaround, the shared system maintainer must first validate the
> problem, confirm that the workaround exists, is systematically viable
> and does not cause adverse effects. The implementation of such
> workarounds will eliminate delay in adjudication of Medicare claims
> and the payment to providers. Utilizing a Priority 3 or Priority 4
> workaround shall not diminish the integrity of the shared systems and
> shall not include such actions as deactivating standard edits. The
> shared system's priorities are formally defined at Section 40.2 of
> this chapter.

## - Shared System Testing Requirements for Shared System Maintainers, Single Testing Contractor (STC)/Beta Testers, and Medicare A/B, Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Administrative Contractors

### (Rev. 97, Issued: 01-15-16, Effective: 09-21-15, Implementation: 09-21-15)

> Medicare requires implementation of a limited number of shared systems
> that must be used by all MACs for the administrative responsibilities
> of Traditional Medicare (Part A, B and DME
>
> claims). This eliminates the need for each A/B, DME MAC to repeat
> development of the base system as part of the complete system
> development life cycle (SDLC).
>
> CMS requires that the shared system quarterly release be subjected to
> the complete testing life cycle prior to production release. The goal
> is to ensure that all changes function as intended and that the
> implementation of changes does not degrade or otherwise
> unintentionally affect existing system capability and function prior
> to implementation. This requires that the shared system be subjected
> to all levels and types of testing including unit testing, integration
> testing, systems testing, functional testing, interface testing,
> performance testing, regression testing, and operational testing.
> Definitions are provided in subsection 40.3.9.
>
> The Shared System Maintainer and the Medicare A/B, DME MACs each have
> specific roles in testing the shared system quarterly release.
> Additionally, CMS contracts with a CMS Single Testing Contractor (STC)
> to act as a Beta tester for the FISS, MCS, VMS, and CWF shared systems
> respectively.
>
> The CMS Single Testing Contractor (STC) assumes primary responsibility
> for testing the Medicare Shared Systems. The STC will be fully
> responsible for meeting the requirements of the Beta tester as
> outlined in Chapter 7, Section 40.3, including all subsections. STC
> interface testing with HIGLAS will be initiated as a shadow test on
> Part A. The STC shall also initiate Railroad Retirement Board (RRB)
> testing. Three Medicare Contractor numbers have been established to
> accommodate STC testing. They are 00888 for MCS systems testing, 00388
> for FISS systems testing, and 44410 for DMEMAC systems testing.
>
> This section identifies the testing responsibilities for each
> organization to ensure that each shared system quarterly release
> satisfies all CMS requirements. All organizations shall have processes
> in place to meet these requirements. Testing activities will generally
> begin 3 to 4 months in advance of the release date, particularly for
> shared system maintainers.

## -- Shared System Testing Requirements for Shared System Maintainers,

> **Single Testing Contractor (STC), and DME MACs**

### (Rev. 97, Issued: 01-15-16, Effective: 09-21-15, Implementation: 09-21-15)

> Review subsection 40.3.9, Definitions, for a description of key
> testing terminology.

1.  [Maintainers]{.underline} of a Shared System shall plan and execute
    all the essential levels of testing. At a minimum this includes Unit
    testing, Integration testing, System testing, and Regression
    testing. Shared System Maintainers are also responsible for
    performing Interface Testing.

2.  [Beta]{.underline} testers may initiate testing at the integration
    level, but are primarily dedicated to testing at the system level,
    including regression testing. Beta testers are also responsible for
    performing Interface Testing, which includes full data exchanges
    between the shared system maintainers, and other systems.

3.  Shared System [Maintainers and]{.underline} [Beta]{.underline}
    testers shall maintain a test environment that enables
    system-testing activities to replicate the production environment,
    as closely as required to effectively test. CMS provided all Beta
    testers with a date simulation tool to facilitate executing test
    cases with future dates (e.g., service dates, admission dates)
    without turning off edits or altering effective dates in the test
    environment.

    1.  ## -- Minimum Testing Standards for Shared System Maintainers and the Single Testing Contractor (STC)/Beta Testers

### (Rev. 97, Issued: 01-15-16, Effective: 09-21-15, Implementation: 09-21-15)

1.  The Shared System Maintainers (SSMs), and the Single Testing
    Contractor (STC) shall fully test the quarterly release to ensure it
    is ready to be elevated to production. For the quarterly release to
    be considered fully tested, all the requirements contained within
    the release must be tested. Shared System Maintainers (SSMs) and the
    Single Testing Contractor (STC) must be able to demonstrate the
    degree to which each discrete requirement within a CR has been
    tested and by which test cases. It is therefore mandatory that the
    testers maintain traceability between test cases and the discrete
    requirements being implemented in the release. Additionally, for
    each CR or transmittal under test, the Shared System Maintainers and
    the Single Testing Contractor (STC) must ensure that each discrete
    requirement specified in the **Business Requirements** section of
    any CR/transmittal has been fully tested. The Shared System
    Maintainers and the Single Testing Contractor (STC) shall
    specifically:

    -   Maintain a repository of test requirements against which all
        test cases must be traced.

    -   Prepare and execute a set of test cases that demonstrate the
        requirements were correctly implemented for all change requests
        within the quarterly release.

    -   Maintain traceability between each test case and the requirement
        that the case was designed to test.

2.  The Shared System Maintainers and Single Testing Contractor (STC)
    shall distinguish each test requirement with a unique Requirement
    Identifier. The Requirement Identifier must be a number or qualifier
    preceded by the CMS CR number and SSM CR number, separated by
    dashes. The format of the Requirement Identifier is: \[SSM CR
    No.\]-\[CMS CR No.\]- \[Requirement No.\], where:

    -   SSM CR No. -- is a number that identifies a CMS mandate or user
        change request under test. Free form text can also be used to
        identify changes not associated with maintainer CR numbers,
        e.g., "Regression" to indicate regression testing. Avoid spaces
        and use underscore symbol "\_" instead. Dashes not allowed
        within this number; they are reserved for separation between the
        individual numbers in the Requirement Identifier.

    -   CMS CR No. -- is a minimum 4-digit number that identifies the
        CMS CR associated with the maintainer CR number. If no CMS CR is
        associated with a maintainer CR, use "0000". Dashes are not
        allowed. Avoid spaces and use underscore symbol "\_" instead.
        Dashes not allowed within this number; they are reserved for
        separation between the individual numbers in the Requirement
        Identifier.

    -   Requirement No. -- is a number that uniquely identifies the
        requirement with the CR. For any requirement taken from the
        Business Requirements section of a CMS CR, use the actual number
        from the Requirement \# column. Do not repeat the CMS CR number.
        Dashes not allowed within this number; they are reserved for
        separation between the individual numbers in the Requirement
        Identifier.

> Example: Maintainer CR 22522 corresponds to CMS CR 2634. Business
> Requirement
>
> 2.8 was taken directly from CMS CR 2634. The Requirement Identifier
> would be 22522- 2634-2.8.

3.  The Shared System Maintainer and the Single Testing Contractor (STC)
    shall complete Test Case specifications that include specific input
    situations and the expected results associated with a single test
    purpose. Each test case specification must include the following:

    -   A unique Test Case Identifier (which includes a cross-reference
        to the requirement in which the case is designed to test);

    -   The specific objective or purpose of the case;

    -   Input specifications (i.e., a description of the input
        situation\[s\]);

    -   Output specifications (i.e., a description of the expected
        results); and

    -   Intercase dependencies - in instances where the test results of
        one test case may impact other test cases, the test case
        specification must identify the other test case(s) and describe
        the relationship(s).

> Refer to section 40.3.10, Test Case Specification Standard, for the
> specific format required to electronically maintain test cases.

4.  All Test Cases must contain a unique Test Case Identifier. The CMS
    standard for the Test Case Identifier is the Requirement Identifier,
    followed by a number that uniquely qualifies the test case
    specification, separated by a dash.

> The format of the Test Case Identifier is: \[Requirement
> Identifier\]-\[Test Case Number\], where:

-   Requirement Identifier -- is the actual identifier of the
    requirement being testing by the case.

-   Test Case Number -- is a number that uniquely qualifies the test
    case. This is generally a sequential number. This is necessary since
    more than one test case is often needed to test a single
    requirement. Dashes not allowed within this number; they are
    reserved for separation between the individual numbers in the Test
    Case Identifier.

> Example: Two test cases were developed to test the implementation of
> Requirement 22522-2634-2.8 (see example above). The unique Test Case
> Identifier for the two test cases would be 22522-2634-2.8-01 and
> 22522-2634-2.8-02.

5.  The Shared System Maintainers and the Single Testing Contractor
    (STC) shall document and execute **both** positive and negative test
    cases to ensure the requirements of the release are correctly
    implemented.

    -   Positive test cases are required to ensure that the system is
        directly fulfilling the requirements as specified. One or more
        positive test cases are required for each

> requirement. As an example, if a program mandate effects a change for
> services beginning on July 1, a positive test case would include
> service dates in July or later and validate that the actual mandate
> was correctly implemented.

-   Negative test cases test cases are required to ensure that the
    system does not perform an incorrect action. As an example, if a
    program mandate effects a change for services beginning on July 1, a
    negative test case would ensure that implementing the mandate did
    not negatively impact claims with service dates prior to July 1.
    Unlike positive test cases, a negative test case may not be
    applicable to every requirement within a CR. Additionally, although
    due diligence might necessitate a negative test case, the need may
    be mitigated by an existing case in your regression test set.

6.  The Shared System Maintainers and the Single Testing Contractor
    (STC) shall document all test cases and the actual results for each
    test case electronically. Each test case and the associated results
    must be stored in a test management repository (i.e., Application
    Lifecycle Management (ALM) tool) and must at a minimum contain the
    data elements outlined in the CMS Test Case specification standard.
    See subsection 40.3.10 for the Test Case specification standard.

7.  The Shared System Maintainers and the Single Testing Contractor
    (STC) shall maintain a test log that provides a record of each test
    execution. Test Log requirements may be fulfilled by correctly using
    the ALM "run" feature (or an equivalent tool or approach) as
    outlined in the Quarterly Release Test Management User Guide.

8.  The Shared System Maintainers and the Single Testing Contractor
    (STC) shall execute a full regression test set on their system for
    every quarterly release. Each testing entity shall perform
    regression testing within their designated testing window as
    outlined in subsection 40.3.7, Timeframe Requirements.

9.  The Shared System Maintainers and the Single Testing Contractor
    (STC) shall perform interface testing.

    -   The Shared System Maintainers and the Single Testing Contractor
        (STC) shall validate that [all]{.underline} output files are
        correctly created by their system. The SSMs and STC shall
        validate that their system can accept and correctly process
        [all]{.underline} input files.

    -   The Shared System Maintainers and the Single Testing Contractor
        (STC) shall perform interface testing that includes full data
        exchanges (both ways) between the shared system and any
        principal claims processing adjudication or financial system
        (e.g., the CWF and HIGLAS respectively). The STC is required to
        perform data exchanges with HIGLAS after HIGLAS is implemented
        at the STC's data center.

    -   The Shared System Maintainers and the Single Testing Contractor
        (STC) shall complete an integrated system test coordinating the
        maintenance of test data baselines, such as beneficiary data,
        with the CWF Beta tester.

        1.  ## -- Testing Standards Applicable to all Beta Testers

### (Rev. 97, Issued: 01-15-16, Effective: 09-21-15, Implementation: 09-21-15)

1.  Each shared system maintainer and each beta tester shall complete
    integrated testing with the CWF Beta tester, using coordinated
    beneficiary data, in the execution of their test cases. All test
    cases involving CWF functionality (related to claims adjudication)
    must be executed in an integrated test with the CWF. This requires
    full data exchanges between testing entities including:

    -   Satellite files being sent from the shared systems to the CWF
        Beta tester; and

    -   Response files being sent from the CWF to the shared system Beta
        testers.

2.  Each Beta tester shall:

    -   Utilize the standard CMS Test Management tool and repository to
        documents all test cases and results.

    -   Follow the procedures outlined in the Quarterly Release Test
        Management User Guide in order to complete the documentation of
        test runs and results.

3.  Each STC/beta tester shall review all Shared System Maintainer
    release documentation for completeness, accuracy, and usability. Any
    questions, problems, or issues with the documentation shall be
    forwarded to both the Shared System Maintainer and CMS.

4.  Each STC/beta tester shall conduct performance testing to reasonably
    assure that the system provides acceptable response times,
    throughput rates, and processing windows and can accommodate
    production workloads.

5.  The CMS testing requirements outlined in section 40.3 may require
    the STC/beta tester to test a specific type of bill, specialty, or
    claim situation for which they do not possess the required level of
    expertise. In these instances, the STC/beta tester must partner with
    a Medicare A/B, DME MAC that possesses both the expertise and
    capabilities to test the specialty or claim type. As an example,
    should the STC/beta tester not have the operational capability or
    expertise to process Home Health claims, they are expected to
    partner with an A/B MAC (HHH) to complete the required HHA testing.
    Ultimately, the STC/beta tester is responsible for ensuring all test
    cases are exercised. Any partnerships that are established to
    complete the testing requirements shall be arranged and managed by
    the STC/beta tester.

    1.  ## - Testing Requirements Applicable to the CWF Beta Tester

### (Rev. 43; Issued: 03-30-07; Effective: 07-01-07; Implementation: 07-02-07)

> The CWF Beta tester shall act as a test host and exchange data with
> entities testing the FISS, MCS, and VMS shared systems. The testing
> entities include all shared system maintainers [and]{.underline} the
> shared system Beta testers.

## -- Part A/Part B (A/B) Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) (User) and the Single Testing Contractor (STC) Testing Requirements

### (Rev. 97, Issued: 01-15-16, Effective: 09-21-15, Implementation: 09-21-15)

> A/B, DME MACs are not mandated to prepare and execute test cases that
> cover Medicare business requirements implemented within the base
> system in standard system and CWF quarterly releases. Shared System
> Maintainers and the STC are fully responsible for testing the base
> functionality. The A/B, DME MAC (users) shall test their local/unique
> components and conduct a limited, end-to-end, operational test.

1.  A/B, DME MACs shall fully test their local components and processing
    rules prior to production implementation of the quarterly release.
    This testing is applicable for all local components and processing
    rules modified since the previous quarterly release.

    A.  A/B, DME MACs shall test any system components they maintain and
        implement to support claims processing in addition to the base
        system. This includes front-end and back-end components such as
        those for EDI entry and translation, EDI outbound processing,
        and printing (e.g., MSN generation).

    B.  A/B, DME MACs shall test changes they make to user control
        files, facilities, and tables in order to implement new Medicare
        policy or business rules. Examples of these facilities include
        but are not limited to auto adjudication facilities (e.g., ECPS
        and MCS SCF) and the MCS SPITAB.

    C.  A/B, DME MAC shall fully test any shared system functionality
        that was:

        -   Developed by the shared system maintainer solely for them,
            > or

        -   Developed by the shared system maintainer under a special
            > project in which they were the exclusive participant.

> An example would be a MAC working with CMS on a special demonstration
> project. In this example the MAC shall fully test the shared system
> functionality that was implemented for the demonstration project.

2.  A/B, DME MACs shall complete a limited end-to-end operational test
    that incorporates the shared system release, integrated with their
    other claims processing components. These components include the
    front-end for claims receipt, translators, the CWF, the financials,
    and back-end EDI and report generation. The test must ensure that
    processing is contiguous from claims entry, to claims adjudication,
    and ultimately remittance and Medicare Summary Notice generation.
    Through contiguous processing, the interfaces between all key claims
    processing components must be exercised. The banking system
    interfaces such as National Clearing House (NCH) transfers need not
    be exercised. The test is limited in the number of test cases that
    are required, since shared system maintainers and the STC are
    testing the base functionality of the shared system.

    A.  A/B, DME MACs shall ensure that the integrated systems software
        can complete cycles without system abends and produce the
        expected output. The A/B, DME Medicare Contractor shall ensure
        their operational test:

-   Exercises all claims entry points not fully incorporated in the base
    > system such as paper and EMC front-end components;

-   Includes all allowable standard electronic formats and versions;

-   Includes a variety of claims types; and

-   Includes all components that support their claims workload and
    > interfaces to the shared system.

    A.  The operational test shall include the most recent shared system
        release received prior to the initiation of the test. A/B, DME
        MACs shall initiate the test as required to ensure its
        completion and the reporting of any problem prior to production
        implementation.

3.  CMS strongly encourages the shared system user community to promote:

-   Standardizing their system nationally,

-   Centralizing any table maintenance that implements national Medicare
    policy at the system maintainer level, and

-   Minimizing local variations.

4.  A/B, DME MACs may perform additional testing on the shared system or
    duplicate Beta testing tasks as time permits. At the discretion of
    their Regional Offices, the A/B, DME MACs may be required to
    separately document any testing they perform in addition to their
    mandated testing.

5.  A/B, DME MACs shall test any business rule or event with future
    dates that they code or set- up in their Auto Adjudication Software
    (AAS), prior to implementing the rule or event into production.
    Examples of AAS include but are not limited to ECPS, SCF, the Shack,
    and the Mill.

    1.  ## - Testing Requirements Applicable to all CWF Data Centers (Hosts)

### (Rev. 97, Issued: 01-15-16, Effective: 09-21-15, Implementation: 09-21-15)

> Each CWF data center or CWF sector host shall:

-   Forward all satellite software and documentation to the satellites
    (contractors) to which they serve as the primary production host;

-   Install the CWF quarterly release software in a designated test
    region;

-   Make the designated test region available their satellites (users)
    for testing;

-   Coordinate test data, such as beneficiary data, with the user
    testers;

-   Process all satellite files submitted by the users and return all
    corresponding reply files generated for users;

-   Report release problems to the CWF Maintainer and CMS;

-   Verify with CMS that each of its satellites submitted at least one
    test file during user testing; and

-   The CWF Host shall support future date testing by the MACs.

-   The CWF Host shall review date simulation schedule submitted by the
    FISS FWG, MCS FWG, and DMOP TAG.

## - Timeframe Requirements for all Testing Entities

### (Rev. 97, Issued: 01-15-16, Effective: 09-21-15, Implementation: 09-21-15)

> The SSMs, STC, and MAC shall operate under the testing timeframes
> shown below for each quarterly release:

### Timeframe Requirements for Testing Entities

![](vertopal_de7cb0474d274008b1926e967cb7c052/media/image2.png){width="5.894292432195975in"
height="3.067707786526684in"}

1.  The Medicare A/B, DME MAC or **User** testing period shall begin
    four weeks prior to production implementation.

2.  The **Beta** testing period shall begin eight weeks prior to
    production implementation. The CWF and standard system Beta testers
    shall have an exclusive four-week testing timeframe prior to the
    initiation of user testing.

    -   The Beta tester shall complete a functional System Test and
        Regression Test before the shared system is released to the User
        community.

    -   Beta testing must also continue through the User testing period.
        The Beta tester may initiate performance testing during the user
        testing period.

3.  Exclusive CWFM and SSM testing shall continue until Beta testing is
    initiated eight weeks prior to production implementation. The SSM
    and CWFM shall complete a Unit Test (on all components), Integration
    Test, System Test, and Regression Test prior to distributing the
    shared system release to the designated Beta tester. For all
    integration, system, and regression testing, the SSM shall use the
    most recent version of any third party or CMS provided software
    components (e.g., Pricer, OCE, MCE, Grouper) they are provided. The

> SSM shall continue testing beyond the exclusive maintainer-testing
> window due to the late receipt of some third party or CMS provided
> software components such as the Pricers and OCE.

## - Testing Documentation Requirements

### (Rev. 97, Issued: 01-15-16, Effective: 09-21-15, Implementation: 09-21-15)

1.  The SSM, STC, and MAC shall maintain documentation that fully
    demonstrates the requirements of this transmittal were met for each
    quarterly release. At a minimum the SSM, Beta tester, and MAC shall
    maintain the following test documentation to demonstrate full
    compliance:

    -   Test Requirement and Test Case repository with traceability;

    -   Test Log;

    -   Test Status for the execution (run) of each test case (i.e.,
        Pass, Fail, Not Run);

    -   Actual Results for the run of each test case in which the
        [actual]{.underline} results did not match the
        [expected]{.underline} results; and

    -   Documented proof of each test run, i.e., screen shots, scheduler
        job logs, etc.

2.  The SSM, STC, and MAC shall:

    -   Maintain all test documentation for the four quarterly releases
        prior to the current release under test. The documentation must
        be available for review by CMS (or its agent).

    -   Document all software defects (problems) within the CMS
        specified repository such as INFOMAN.

3.  The SSM shall communicate all confirmed software defects (problems)
    and fixes directly to CMS in writing through their CMS Maintenance
    Lead/(GTL) or other designee as specified by the CMS Project
    Officer.

4.  A/B, DME MACs shall provide any testing documentation to their CMS
    regional office upon request.

> Additional requirements for selected shared system maintainers, STC,
> and CWF hosts may be contained in these organizations\' individual
> contracts. Electronic screen shots may be incorporated/attached into
> the results of ALM has proof of online results. Test Log requirements
> may be fulfilled by correctly using the ALM "run" feature as outlined
> in the Quarterly Release Test Management User Guide.

## - Definitions

### (Rev. 105, Issued: 06-02-17, Effective: 07-03-17, Implementation: 07-03-17)

> These definitions are provided to ensure common understanding.
>
> [Base Shared System]{.underline} - The FISS, MCS, VMS, or CWF system,
> which is routinely released by the Shared System Maintainers to their
> respective user community prior to any user customization. This
> includes all components released by the Shared System Maintainer,
> including but not limited to the claim adjudication subsystem, the
> financial subsystems, and other integrated components (i.e., Pricer,
> OCE, MCE, Grouper).
>
> [Functional Testing]{.underline} -- Testing to ensure that the
> functional requirements have been met. Functional testing is performed
> by the SSMs and the STC.
>
> [Integration Testing]{.underline} -- Testing combinations of
> interacting software components that make up parts of a system.
> Integration testing is performed by the SSMs, and the STC.
>
> [Interface Testing]{.underline} -- Testing conducted to evaluate

> performed by the STC.
>
> [Local Components]{.underline} -- A Local Component as referenced in
> section 40.3 is any component or module that supports Medicare claims
> processing, but is not part of the Base System and is under the
> control and maintenance of the MAC.
>
> [Maintainer]{.underline} -- The Maintainer is an entity to which CMS
> directly contracts to maintain a Medicare claim processing shared
> system (FISS, MCS, VMS, or the Common Working File (CWF) system). The
> Maintainer, as referenced in section 40.3, does not refer to an entity
> to which a A/B or DME MAC subcontracts to operate their data center or
> perform other claim processing support activities.
>
> [Operational Testing]{.underline} -- Testing conducted to evaluate a
> system in its operational environment. Testing to ensure that the
> aggregate operational systems and their interfaces can be operated
> securely with the instructions provided. Operational Testing is
> performed by the SSMs and the A/B and DME MACs.
>
> [Performance Testing]{.underline} -- Testing that applies heavy
> transaction and processing loads to the system to ensure that response
> times, throughput rates, and processing windows remain acceptable and
> can accommodate production workloads. Performance Testing is performed
> by the STC.
>
> [Regression Testing]{.underline} -- Testing conducted on a system or
> components to verify that modifications have not caused unintended
> effects and that the system or components still complies with its
> requirements. Regression testing is performed by the SSMs and the STC.
>
> [Regression Test Set]{.underline} -- A set of selectable test cases
> designed to exercise a system over its functional capabilities and
> assure that it still works properly after changes have been applied.
>
> [Requirement Identifier]{.underline} -- A unique number assigned to

> the CMS CR Number, and an alphanumeric element to uniquely qualify
> each requirement. For testing purposes CMS requires that each Test
> Case Identifier incorporate the Requirement Identifier to which it is
> traced.
>
> [Stress Testing]{.underline} -- Testing that applies a steadily
> increasing load to the system until it reaches the point where
> performance degrades to unacceptable levels.
>
> [System Testing]{.underline} -- Testing to discover any incorrect
> implementation of the requirements or incompatibilities in the
> software/hardware environment. System testing includes functional
>
> testing, performance testing, and operational testing. System testing
> is performed by the SSMs and the STC.
>
> [Test Case Specification]{.underline} -- A description of an input
> situation and of the required results associated with a specific test
> objective or purpose.
>
> [Test Case Identifier]{.underline} -- A unique identifier assigned to
> each test case.
>

> about the execution of tests. Relevant details include run date, run
> time, test status, and actual results.
>
> [Test Requirement]{.underline} - A specific requirement that is under
> test and to which one or more test cases are traced. Test requirements
> may be derived from various types of requirements i.e., business
> functional requirements, performance requirements etc. Note: Any
> well-written requirement that is "testable" may be considered a Test
> Requirement. Any requirement contained in the Business Requirements
> section of a CR or transmittal, also constitutes a test requirement.
>
> [Test Set]{.underline} -- A collection of test cases that have a
> common usage.
>
> [Unit Testing]{.underline} -- The testing of individual units (i.e.,
> software components, modules) or groups of related units. It is the
> lowest level of testing and is usually performed by programmers. Unit
> testing may be both functional (requirements oriented) and structural
> (i.e. logic oriented, code coverage oriented). Unit testing is
> performed by the SSMs.

## - Next Generation Desktop (NGD) Requirements

### (Rev. 105, Issued: 06-02-17, Effective: 07-03-17, Implementation: 07-03-17)

> CMS has fully deployed the Next Generation Desktop (NGD) to the
> contractors' beneficiary customer service contact centers. The NGD is
> a multiple call center application that is used by Medicare Customer
> Service Representatives (CSRs) to answer inquiries and perform
> operations on behalf of CMS beneficiaries and the American public.
>
> The NGD is designed to pull customer service-needed information into a
> common desktop application. As such, the NGD requires data exchange
> with CMS shared systems (VMS, CWF, FISS, MCS) and standard systems
> (Enrollment Database (EDB)/Master Beneficiary Database (MBD), Master
> Beneficiary Record (MBR), Group Health Plan (GHP)/Maricopa Managed
> Care System (MMCS). Note: NGD may integrate with additional systems as
> future releases are developed.
>
> Because NGD integrates with the shared systems, periodic changes will
> be made to the NGD Integration Layer as a result of the shared systems
> quarterly release process. The NGD maintainer will be required to
> update NGD in shares systems quarterly releases (Jan, Apr, July, Oct.)
> The NGD maintainer will be required to perform the various activities
> associated with changes to the NGD (i.e., unit and system testing). In
> addition to the shared systems quarterly release schedule, the NGD
> will adhere to a separate quarterly functional release process for
> NGD-specific updates and defect correction.
>
> The NGD maintainer shall follow all of the requirements identified in
> Section 40.3 for the shared system maintainers except as indicated
> below:

1.  Section 40.3.1 Maintainers and Beta Testers --Required Levels of
    Testing, #3 is not applicable to NGD Beta testers.

2.  Section 40.3.2 (#2) Minimum Testing Standards for Maintainers and
    Beta Testers, for NGD naming conventions, the NGD Maintainer should
    refer to the NGD test Plan.

3.  Section 40.3.2 (#4) Minimum Testing Standards for Maintainers and
    Beta Testers, for NGD test case identifiers, the NGD maintainer
    should refer to the NGD System Test Plan.

4.  Section 40.3.7 Timeframe Requirements for Testing Entities -- NGD
    testing timeframes are as follows:

    -   The official NGD User Acceptance testing period conducted by the
        VCS Support Contractor shall begin 2 weeks prior to production
        implementation.

        -   The overall NGD testing period shall begin 3 weeks prior to
            > production implementation. The NGD VCS Support testers
            > shall have an exclusive 1 week testing timeframe prior to
            > the initiation of user testing (Validation testing)

> -The User Acceptance tester shall complete a functional System Test
> and Regression Test before the system is released to the User
> community.

-   Exclusive NGD System Maintainer testing shall continue until User
    > Acceptance testing is initiated 3 weeks prior to production
    > implementation. The NGD Maintainer shall complete a Unit Test (on
    > all components), Integration Test, System Test, and Regression
    > Test prior to distributing the shared system release to the
    > designated Beta Tester.

5.  Section 40.3.8 Testing Documentation Requirements (#2) For NGD,
    documentation of all software defects (problems) should be through
    ClearQuest.

> [Implementation Date]{.underline}

I.  Definition

> Refer to section 50.4.2 of this chapter for the definition of the
> implementation date.

II. Supporting Information

> For any instruction affecting providers, regardless if there are
> Systems or Non-systems changes, CMS gives at least 90 days' advance
> notice to the providers. That is, CMS must issue the instruction at
> least 90 days prior to the implementation date to give providers
> enough time to implement the instruction. The vehicle used to alert
> providers 90 days prior to an instruction's implementation date is the
> CMS Quarterly Provider Update, which can be accessed at:
> [[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/QuarterlyProviderUpdates/01_Overview.asp]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/QuarterlyProviderUpdates/01_Overview.asp)
>
> There are four exceptions to the 90 days' advance notice policy: (1)
> the instruction is contractor specific and therefore does not affect
> providers; (2) the instruction is a correction/clarification where the
> previously issued instruction contained typos or errors of fact or
> omissions; (3) the instruction is a routine or recurring item (which
> qualifies it to be included on the Mid-Quarter
>
> List in the Provider Update); and (4) the instruction is approved by
> the CMS Administrator to be published immediately or by a certain
> date.
>
> If a previously issued instruction is re-issued with revised MAC
> requirements and a revised implementation date is not specified, MACs
> shall comply with the revised instruction as soon as possible but no
> later than 10 business days from the CR's date of issuance.
>
> For a system change, the Initiator of the CR will specify an
> implementation date that corresponds to one of the quarterly release
> dates. Usually, the quarterly release date will be the first Monday of
> the quarter. Non-recurring system changes are usually issued five
> months in advance of the implementation date. On occasion, an
> off-cycle release date can be approved by OSORA and/or the
> Administrator. This exception tends to occur most frequently with the
> implementation of National Coverage Determinations (NCDs) and
> corrections to finals.
>
> For a Non-system change that has no impact on providers, the Initiator
> of the CR may specify the implementation date as 30 days from
> issuance. For a Non-system change that has provider impact, the
> Initiator of the CR may specify the implementation date as 90 days
> from issuance.
>
> After the comment period ends and the Initiator of the CR has
> addressed all comments, he/she prepares a final CR package for CMS
> clearance. The last part of the CMS clearance process involves
> obtaining approval from the Medicare Change Control Board (MCCB). The
> MCCB, in consultation with the Initiator of the CR, will determine the
> time period needed for implementing each change request. After the
> clearance process is completed, the Office of Strategic Operations and
> Regulatory Affairs/Issuances & Records Management Group (OSORA/IRMG)
> will insert the actual implementation date before issuing the CR as a
> final instruction.

### COMPLETING AND SUBMITTING THE QUARTERLY CR IMPLEMENTATION REPORT (CRIR)

> Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) shall complete the CR
> Implementation Report, as follows, for each jurisdiction. MACs with
> multiple jurisdictions may complete a separate sheet within a single

    additional TDLs, they should continue numbering from the previous
    CMS entered row in red font. For example, if CMS included 15 TDLs on
    the report, the contractor shall begin numbering in this field with
    16 in red font.

2.  Item 6: TDL #. CMS CO will complete this field with the TDL number
    for each public TDL issued during the quarter.

3.  Item 7: CMS Component. CMS CO will complete this field with the CMS
    Component responsible for issuing the TDL. \[If MACs added the TDL
    to the report, they do not need to complete item 7 for those TDLs.\]

4.  Item 8: Subject. CMS CO will complete this field with the subject
    for all TDLs issued during the quarter.

5.  Item 9: CMS Issued Date MM/DD/YYYY. CMS CO will complete this field
    with the Issued date in MM/DD/YYYY format for all TDLs issued during
    the quarter.

6.  Item 10: Applicable Workload? ("X" or blank). MACs shall complete
    this field with an "X" for all TDLs applicable to their workload or
    leave blank if the TDL is not applicable to their workload. The TDL
    is considered applicable to the contractor if any action in the TDL
    were required to be completed by the contractor in the reporting
    period.

7.  Item 11: Contractor Compliance? ("Y", "N" or blank). MACs shall
    complete this field with a "y" for all applicable TDLs that the
    contractor has received, reviewed and complied with the instructions
    in the TDL. MACs shall complete this field with a "n" for all
    applicable TDLs that the contractor has received and reviewed, but
    has not complied with the instructions in the TDL. This field shall
    remain blank if the TDL is not applicable to the contractor (i.e.
    Item 10 is blank).

8.  Item 12: Reason for Delay (Leave blank if in compliance). This field
    shall remain blank if the TDL has been complied with on or before
    the due date (i.e. Item 11 is a "y") or is not applicable to
    contractor workload (i.e. Item 11 is blank). If the contractor did
    not comply with the instructions in the TDL (i.e. Item 11 is a "n"),
    the contractor shall select one of the following reasons from the
    drop-down list in this field:

    1.  Due date changed due to TDL

    2.  Due date changed due to CR

    3.  System Changes Required to Comply

    4.  TDL extension approved or pending

    5.  Deadline past quarter end date

    6.  Other

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  [​(Due date changed due to TDL)]{.underline} -- Applies only in

4.  []{#_bookmark60 .anchor}**- Change Request (CR) Definitions**

> **(Rev. 66, Issued: 01-07-11, Effective: 02-08-11, Implementation:
> 02-08-11)**

## - Issue Date

### (Rev. 66, Issued: 01-07-11, Effective: 02-08-11, Implementation: 02-08-11)

> The date the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
> publishes a change request (CR).
>
> When a CR has passed through all phases of the change management
> process, it is then ready for publication; that is, the CMS is ready
> to make the instructions contained in the CR available to contractors,
> maintainers, providers, beneficiaries and/or any group or organization
> that may be affected, as appropriate. The CMS publishes CRs by posting
> them as Transmittals, on the CMS Web site.
>
> Note: The issue date is named "Date" on the Transmittal form, One-Time
> Notification, Recurring Update Notification, and the Standard CR
> forms. It is sometimes referred to as the "transmittal date."

## - Implementation Date

### (Rev. 66, Issued: 01-07-11, Effective: 02-08-11, Implementation: 02-08-11)

> The implementation date identified in a change request (CR) is the
> date by which Medicare fee- for-service contractors and shared system
> maintainers shall apply all changes detailed in the business
> requirements, unless otherwise specified. It is the date when all
> necessary updates to infrastructure, business processes and/or
> supporting technology changes shall be completed and operational in
> order to execute new/modified policy and procedure.
>
> For CRs that do not require changes to the shared systems (non-system
> changes), contractors are usually given 30 to 90 days from issuance to
> implement the CR.
>
> For CRs that do require changes to the shared systems (system
> changes), a date is specified that usually corresponds with one of the
> quarterly shared system release dates. The date is usually the first
> Monday of the quarter (for example, January 3, April 4, July 5, or
> October 3 for 2011).
>
> Unless otherwise stated, the implementation date is the same for all
> business requirements listed within a specific CR. In some instances,
> a separate implementation date(s) may be given for a particular
> business requirement(s) within a CR.
>
> Implementation and effective dates are frequently not the same. The
> list below contains the scenarios for the differences:

-   The effective date and implementation date are different because the
    first day of the quarter is not a Monday;

-   The effective date and the implementation date are different because
    the effective date occurs after the implementation date;

-   The effective date and the implementation date are different because
    the effective date occurs before the implementation date, but both
    dates are in the future; or

-   The effective date and the implementation date are different because
    the effective date occurs before the implementation date, and the
    effective date is in the past, while the implementation date is in
    the future.

    1.  ## - Effective Date

### (Rev. 66, Issued: 01-07-11, Effective: 02-08-11, Implementation: 02-08-11)

> The effective date identified in a change request (CR) is the date on
> which any new rules, laws, processes and/or policies become active.
>
> Beginning on this date, Medicare contractors shall apply the new rules
> to process Medicare claims according to their updated business
> processes and supporting technology.
>
> The effective date is normally a mandated date resulting from
> legislation or a regulation. In the case of National Coverage
> Determinations (NCDs), the effective date is the first day the item or
> service that is the subject of the NCD is covered nationally under the
> Medicare Program.
>
> Effective dates are not always future dates; sometimes, they are in
> the past. When this happens, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
> Services (CMS) instructs contractors, using business requirements, how
> to process claims for the period between the effective date and the
> implementation date. Typically, the effective date is the first day of
> any given fiscal year quarter or the first day of the month.

## - Date of Service

### (Rev. 66, Issued: 01-07-11, Effective: 02-08-11, Implementation: 02-08-11)

> The date of service (DOS) is the date a provider renders service to a
> beneficiary. Unless otherwise specified, the effective date of a
> change request is the date of service.
>
> For the purpose of processing claims, the effective date for applying
> processing rules, laws, processes, and/or policies is the date the
> beneficiary received a service from a provider. For Durable Medical
> Equipment (DME) claims with spanned dates of service, the ViPS
> Medicare System (VMS) will use only the "From" DOS as the date the
> supplier rendered a service to a beneficiary. For example, if a new
> rule or law became effective on January 1, 2011, and a beneficiary
> received service on December 27, 2010, then that service would not be
> covered under the new rule. If the beneficiary received the service on
> or after January 1, 2011, then that service would be covered by the
> new rule.
>
> More service-specific information on the Date of Service can be found
> in. Pub.100-02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual and Pub. 100-04,
> Medicare Claims Processing Manual.

## - Procedures for Modifying Shared System Edits and Capturing Audit Trail Data

### (Rev. 23, Issued: 05-06-05; Effective: 10-01-05; Implementation: 10-03-05) POLICY

> Contractors must implement processes and procedures for adding,
> deleting, inactivating, bypassing or otherwise modifying all shared
> system edits. Contractors must also have the capability to document
> and track those modifications. Modifications to maintainer coded edits
> must additionally include documentation that provides the rationale
> for the modification, the expected duration of the change, the impact
> of the change with respect to potential over or underpayments, claims
> volumes, effect on providers and / or beneficiaries, etc. In addition,
> the claims operations manager or equivalent area manager must document
> approval of the edit modification followed by CMS approval before any
> maintainer coded edit change has been made.
>
> MACs shall examine their current processes for modifying shared system
> edits and adjust them to incorporate the appropriate levels of
> internal controls. These controls must be documented and available
> upon request for review by CMS or an auditor. In addition, contractors
> must limit the number of personnel with the security clearance to
> modify maintainer coded shared system edits to ten (10).
>
> Should the reason for an edit modification be because of a shared
> system deficiency, that associated problem must be documented and
> reported to the maintainer by the contractor. The shared system
> maintainer and contractor must prioritize the appropriate systems
> changes to correct edit deficiencies and schedule them for correction
> as soon as possible via existing change management processes. Should
> there not be consensus with the contractors regarding schedule, CMS
> maintenance staff should be consulted.
>
> Shared system maintainers must have the capability to track edit
> changes made by a contractor to the maintainer coded shared system
> edits. The shared systems must be able to identify who modified the
> edit, what was modified and when the alteration was made.

## - CMS Standard File for Reason Codes

### (Rev. 59, Issued: 10-30-09, Effective: 04-01-10, Implementation: 04-05-10)

> The A/B MAC (A) or (HHH) Edits Evaluation Workgroup is tasked with
> identifying the inventory of contractor inactivated edits, documenting
> the reasons why the edits are turned off, and making a decision as to
> whether they should remain inactive or not. Transmittal 338, (Change
> Request (CR) 5927) issued on May 2, 2008, created the 'CMS Standard'
> field within the existing FISS Reason Code File which contains the
> status that was determined by the A/B MAC (A) or (HHH) Edits
> Evaluation Workgroup for each individual code that was reviewed. The
> 'CMS Standard' field indicators are as follows:

-   'A' = Active

-   'I' = Inactive

-   ' ' = Blank

> **NOTE:** The terms 'Active' & 'Inactive' are defined as:

-   Active = Reason code status is equal to 'S', 'P', ' ' (blank), 'D',
    > 'R', 'T', or is not equal to 'S MDLTD'; and

-   Inactive = Reason code status is equal to 'A' or is equal to 'S
    > MDLTD.'

> Each quarter, as necessary, CMS will issue an updated CMS Standard
> File for Reason Codes which is loaded into the system by the FISS
> maintainer via a Recurring Update Notification.

## 70 - Change Management Process \-- Electronic Change Information Management Portal (ECHIMP)

### (Rev. 100, Issued: 06-23-16; Effective: 07-05-16; Implementation: 07-05-2016)

> The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS's) Division of
> Change Management (DCM) is responsible for the coordination and
> distribution of the draft Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) Change
> Requests (CRs) for Point-of-Contact (POC) Review. To that end, the DCM
> has developed the Electronic Change Information Management Portal
> (ECHIMP), a user-friendly, Web-based application to streamline and
> automate the change management process.
>
> In September 2004, the initiators of the CRs began creating and
> submitting CRs to the DCM via ECHIMP. In the past, the DCM distributed
> the draft Medicare FFS CRs to only 15 contractor POCs and shared
> system maintainers (SSMs) for POC review. The SSMs forwarded the CRs
> to their users for review which increased the time to market the CR
> and sometimes resulted in the submission of late comments. Therefore,
> beginning January 3, 2006, the DCM will continue to notify the CMS and
> SSM POCs of the draft Medicare FFS CRs that are in POC review and also
> notify all the Medicare FFS contractor POCs as well via ECHIMP 2.0.
> The DCM will implement ECHIMP 2.0 on a voluntary basis for its
> internal CMS staff. Initiators of CRs may create and submit a CR for
> POC review using ECHIMP 2.0 beginning January 3, 2006.
>
> However, effective February 6, 2006, ECHIMP 2.0 will be implemented on
> a mandatory basis (i.e., all CRs will be initiated, submitted and
> reviewed in ECHIMP 2.0). The POCs will continue to receive the POC
> Review e-mail for CRs initiated and submitted in ECHIMP 1.0 which will
> contain the CR and the attachments until February 6, 2006. In addition
> to receiving the POC review e-mail with the CR and the attachments,
> POCs will also receive the POC review e-mail alert for CRs that are
> initiated and submitted in ECHIMP 2.0 which will [not]{.underline}
> contain the CR file
>
> and the attachments. However, these e-mail alerts will contain a link
> for the POCs to click to review and submit comments on the CR via
> ECHIMP 2.0.
>
> **NOTE:** Beginning February 6, 2006, contractors and maintainers
> should [not]{.underline} reply to any e- mails from [ECHIMP
> [\@cms.hhs.gov]{.underline}](mailto:eChimp@cms.hhs.gov) nor should
> they send any e-mail to
> [[eChimp@cms.hhs.gov]{.underline}](mailto:eChimp@cms.hhs.gov).
> Effective February 6, 2006, we will not accept any e-mails sent to
> that address.
>
> The notification of the draft Medicare FFS CRs will be distributed via
> an E-mail from ECHIMP to the CMS, contractor and SSM POCs, which will
> no longer contain the files and documents associated with the draft
> CR. Once the POCs receive the e-mail notification from ECHIMP that
> notifies them that a CR is currently in POC review, they shall log in
> to ECHIMP via a link that will be provided in the E-mail notification.
> Once logged in, they shall review the draft CR and provide comments to
> CMS via ECHIMP by the POC Review Comment due date. To maintain as much
> efficiency as possible with such a large number of prospective
> reviewers, each POC may submit only one set of comments on behalf of
> their contractor or maintainer organization and that submission must
> be identified as such. If the CR impacts A/B MAC (A), A/B MAC (B), DME
> MAC and/or A/B MAC (HHH) and it makes more sense to submit the
> comments separately (to keep the content clear), then two sets of
> comments from the contractor site or maintainer organization will be
> acceptable. No response received will be considered a concurrence.
> NOTE: It is the responsibility of the POCs to notify appropriate staff
> that a CR has entered POC review and to share the information with
> them. Each individual who has access to ECHIMP will also have the
> ability to review, download and print the CR files and share the
> files, either electronically or hardcopy, with other staff members who

> Medicare FFS contractors and SSMs will not only decrease the time to
> market the CRs, but will also increase the quality of the review of

> the change the opportunity to comment. We also believe that this
> expansion to the POC review process will reduce the number of late
> comments submitted as well as reduce the number of corrected CRs now
> necessary as a result of uncoordinated and/or untimely POC comments.
>
> CMS realizes that expanding the POC review process to all of the
> Medicare FFS contractors and SSMs could potentially cause a lack of
> efficiency and an administrative burden if the above- outlined POC
> review process is not adhered to. Therefore, we will pilot this
> expanded POC review process for approximately 3 months effective
> February 6, 2006. At the conclusion of the 3 months, we will evaluate
> the pilot and adjust the POC review process, if necessary.

### Change Request Correction and Rescind Process

> Currently, the CR corrections and rescind process is a manual process,
> which is completed via email. CMS is automating the CR correction and
> rescind process utilizing the ECHIMP system. This CR implements the
> following processes:

-   CMS will begin distributing Medicare FFS CRs that are being
    corrected or rescinded for review via a notification from ECHIMP to
    the current POC Review recipients. These notifications will specify
    the type of review to be performed in the subject line of the email
    (i.e., POC, Correction or Rescind Review). All current POC Review
    recipients will receive the notifications whether they are impacted
    on the CR or not. The notifications will specify which Medicare
    Administrative Contractors (MACs) and Shared System

> Maintainers (SSMs) are impacted.

-   Impacted SSMs will review and comment on CRs during the CR\'s
    Correction or Rescind Review Period.

-   Impacted SSMs will update their estimates as a result of the
    correction or rescind.

-   Non-impacted SSMs and non-impacted MACs will be able to review and
    comment on the draft corrected or draft rescinded CRs in ECHIMP, if
    they so choose.

> CRs that have been corrected and rescinded prior to this automation
> will not be updated in ECHIMP. This process will apply to CR
> corrections and Rescinds initiated on or after July 5, 2016.

## - Contractor Workload Transitions

### (Rev.108, Issue: 11-03-17, Effective: 12-04-17, Implementation: 12-04-17)

> Fee-for-Service contractor workload transitions occurred when a
> Medicare Administrative Contractor's (MAC's) period of performance
> ends or its contract is terminated. When either of these two
> circumstances occurs, the outgoing contractor is required to work with
> the new incoming contractor to transfer the Medicare workload without
> any disruption to providers and beneficiaries.
>
> During a transition, the outgoing contractor has responsibilities and
> processes for closing out its Medicare contract and shutting down its
> operation. It must also assist the new incoming contractor in its
> efforts to assume the Medicare claims administration functions.
> Concurrently, the incoming contractor is required to establish an
> operational infrastructure and ensure that all data, records, and
> functions are properly transferred from the outgoing contractor. Both
> parties have a responsibility to ensure that the transition is
> conducted seamlessly and that all contractual obligations are met
> during the transition.

## - Transition Handbooks

### (Rev.108, Issue: 11-03-17, Effective: 12-04-17, Implementation: 12-04-17)

> The Medicare Contractor Management Group (MCMG) in the Center for
> Medicare has developed a handbook in order to assist fee-for-service
> contractors with the transfer of Medicare workload from one contractor
> to another. This is found at:
>
> https[://w](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Contracting/Medicare-Administrative-)ww.[cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Contracting/Medicare-Administrative-](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Contracting/Medicare-Administrative-)
> Contractors/Resources-for-MACs.html
>
> Every Medicare workload transition will vary depending on the unique
> circumstances and environment of the Medicare contractors involved.
> There may be activities and processes described in the handbooks that,
> for various reasons, will not be applicable to a specific transition.
> There may also be activities that will need to be performed that the
> handbooks do not cover. The handbook cannot identify and address all
> of the variations that may occur during a workload transition.
> However, the overall activities described in the handbooks for
> managing a workload implementation or closeout project and the
> requirements contained therein for
>
> meetings, reporting, and providing information, data, and records are
> part of the IOM and incorporated by reference into the MAC contracts.

## 90 - Integrated Data Repository (IDR) Claims Sourcing from Shared Systems

### (Rev. 54, Issued: 10-01-08; Effective: 10-01-08; Implementation: 01-05-09)

> The CMS' fraud investigation landscape is significantly different
> today than in the past as a result of program changes, such as the
> implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug benefit, competitive
> selection of contractors responsible for claims administration and
> program integrity, such as Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs)
> and PSCs, expansion of Medi- Medi and Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC)
> programs, and advent of the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP). CMS
> recognizes the need to significantly enhance the use of technology to
> improve its collaborative fraud fighting efforts as well as to
> establish a modernized data analysis capability for all of Program
> Integrity.
>
> Today, most Program Integrity contractors have built their own data
> warehouses and/or avenues for collecting, processing, analyzing data
> which serves their own individual needs. These distributed, regional
> approaches to data analysis do not lend themselves to national
> analyses, do not represent best practices, and do not take advantage
> of the cost savings that a centralized data repository would provide.
> All of these functions can be better served through a comprehensive
> set of common data structures and modern tools that encourage
> collaboration and innovation.
>
> The IDR goal - through incremental releases - is to be the centralized
> data repository for all Medicare data. The Program Safeguard
> Contractors (PSCs) cannot currently use the IDR exclusively because
> the source of claims data is the National Claims History (NCH). The
> limited NCH data record is inadequate to support the extensive fraud,
> waste and abuse investigations that need to be performed by PSCs. The
> Shared Systems data are the required data source for Program
> Integrity. The CR initiates the acquisition of the Shared Systems data
> for the IDR. Once the IDR has the required Shared Systems data,
> Program Integrity and their contractors will increase their ability to
> detect potential fraud, waste and abuse.
>
> FISS shall provide, in electronic format, all claims output for all
> A/B MACs (A) or (HHH) and claim types on a daily basis at the claims
> header and detail level for each of the three identified lifecycle
> phases required.
>
> MCS shall provide, in electronic format, all claims output for all A/B
> MACs (B) and claim types on a daily basis at the claims header and
> detail level for each of the three identified lifecycle phases
> required.
>
> VMS shall provide, in electronic format, all claims output for all DME
> MACs and Certificates of Medical Necessity, as required with certain
> claims for payment, on a daily basis at the claims header and detail
> level for each of the three lifecycle phases required.
>
> The IDR Lifecycle Phase I is defined as the claim upon enumeration.
> The IDR Lifecycle Phase II is defined as the claim immediately after
> CWF adjudication. The IDR Lifecycle Phase III is defined as the claim
> once financial information has been posted to it.
