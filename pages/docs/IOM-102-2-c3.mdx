> A "Benefit period" is a period of consecutive days during which
> medical benefits for covered services, with certain specified maximum
> limitations, are available to the beneficiary. Under Part A, 60 full
> days of hospitalization plus 30 coinsurance days represent the maximum
> benefit period. The *benefit* period is renewed when the beneficiary
> has not been *an inpatient of* a hospital or *of a* SNF *(see §20.B)*
> for 60 *consecutive* days. Refer to Pub.100-01, Medicare General
> Information, Eligibility, and Entitlement Manual, Chapter 3,

> additional information on benefit periods.

# - Inpatient Benefit Days

> ***(Rev. 261, Issued_10-04-19, Effective: 11-05-19, Implementation:
> 11-05-19)***
>
> **A3-3103, A3-3135, HO-216, SNF-242**

A.  **Inpatient Hospital Benefit Days**

> A patient having hospital insurance coverage is entitled, subject to
> the inpatient deductible and coinsurance requirements, to have payment
> made on his/her behalf for up to 90 days of covered inpatient hospital
> services in each benefit period. Also, the patient has a lifetime
> reserve of 60 additional days (see [[Chapter 5,
> §10]{.underline}](file://CO-ADGLOBAL/manuals/102_policy/bp102c05.pdf)).

B.  **Posthospital Extended Care Days**

> A patient having hospital insurance coverage is entitled (subject to
> the coinsurance requirements described in detail in Pub. 100-01,
> Medicare General Information, Eligibility, and Entitlement Manual,
> Chapter 3, "Deductibles, Coinsurance Amounts, and Payment
> Limitations") to have payment made on his/her behalf for up to 100
> days of covered inpatient extended care services in each benefit
> period.
>
> Refer to Pub. 100-01, Medicare General Information, Eligibility, and
> Entitlement Manual, Chapter *3, §10.4.4* for the definition of SNF
> inpatient for benefit period purposes.

# - Counting Inpatient Days

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3103.1, A3-3104.3, A3-3135.1, HO-217.3, HO-216.1, SNF-242.1**
>
> The number of days of care charged to a beneficiary for inpatient
> hospital or skilled nursing facility (SNF) care services is always in
> units of full days. A day begins at midnight and ends 24 hours later.
> The midnight-to-midnight method is to be used in
>
> counting days of care for Medicare reporting purposes even if the
> hospital or SNF uses a different definition of day for statistical or
> other purposes.
>
> A part of a day, including the day of admission and day on which a
> patient returns from leave of absence, counts as a full day. However,
> the day of discharge, death, or a day on which a patient begins a
> leave of absence is not counted as a day unless discharge or death
> occur on the day of admission. If admission and discharge or death
> occur on the same day, the day is considered a day of admission and
> counts as one inpatient day.
>
> Charges for ancillary services on the day of discharge or death or the
> day on which a patient begins a leave of absence are covered.

# - Late Discharge

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3103.2, A3-3135.2, HO-216.2, SNF-242.2**
>
> When a patient chooses to continue to occupy hospital or SNF
> accommodations beyond the checkout time for personal reasons, the
> hospital or SNF may charge the beneficiary for the continued stay.
> Such a stay beyond the checkout time, for the comfort or convenience
> of the patient, is not covered under the program, and the hospital\'s
> or SNF\'s agreement to participate in the program does not preclude
> charging the patient. However, the hospital must provide the
> beneficiary with an Advance Beneficiary Notice (ABN) before the
> noncovered services are provided. See Medicare Claims Processing
> Manual, chapter 30, for instructions about ABNs.
>
> Where the patient\'s medical condition is the cause of the stay past
> the checkout time (e.g., the patient needs further services, is
> bedridden and awaiting transportation to their home or in the case of
> a hospital, transfer to a skilled nursing facility, or dies in the SNF
> or hospital), the stay beyond the discharge hour is covered under the
> program and the hospital or SNF may not charge the patient.
>
> The imposition of a late checkout charge by a hospital or SNF does not
> affect the counting of days for:

-   Ending a benefit period;

-   The number of days of inpatient care available to the individual in
    a hospital or SNF; and

-   The 3-day prior hospitalization requirement for coverage of post
    hospital extended care services and Part A home health services.

> A late charge by a hospital does not affect counting of days for
> meeting the prior inpatient stay requirement for coverage of extended
> care services.
>
> The Quality Improvement Organization is responsible for reviewing the
> appropriateness of early discharges.

# - Leave of Absence

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3103.3, A3-3135.3, HO-216.3, SNF-242.3**
>
> The day on which the patient began a leave of absence is treated as a
> day of discharge, and is not counted as an inpatient day unless the
> patient returns to the facility by midnight of the same day. The day
> the patient returns to the hospital or SNF from a leave of absence is
> treated as a day of admission and is counted as an inpatient day if
> the patient is present at midnight of that day.
>
> Refer to the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 3, "Inpatient
> Hospital Services," or the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter
> 6, "SNF Inpatient Billing," as appropriate, for reporting inpatient
> leave of absence on the Medicare claim.

# - Discharge or Death on First Day of Entitlement or Participation

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3103.4, A3-3135.4, HO-216.4, SNF-242.4**
>
> For SNF services, the cost of such services has been built into the
> SNF PPS base. This makes the PPS per diem somewhat higher than it
> would otherwise have been for all of the preceding SNF days that Part
> A does cover, even though the day of discharge itself is not a covered
> Part A day:

-   A patient is admitted prior to the first day of entitlement and dies
    or is discharged from a participating hospital on the first day of
    entitlement; or

-   A patient in a noncovered stay in a nonparticipating hospital dies
    or is discharged on the first day the hospital becomes a
    participating hospital. For a late discharge on such a day, the
    rules in [[§20.1.1]{.underline}](#late-discharge) will be followed.

> For SNF services, Medicare does not pay for accommodations on the day
> of discharge or death. Medicare pays for ancillary services (under
> Part A) when a patient dies or is discharged on the first day a
> facility becomes a participating facility and the other requirements
> for coverage of extended care services are met.
>
> Although a day of utilization is not counted in these situations, a
> benefit period begins and any charges for covered services are applied
> against the inpatient hospital deductible.

# 30 - Inpatient Days Counting Toward Benefit Maximums

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3107, A3-3136, HO-216.5, SNF-244**

A.  **90-Day Benefit Limitation**

> Inpatient hospital (including psychiatric hospital) services count
> toward the maximum of 90 benefit days payable per benefit period only
> if:

-   Payment for the services is made;

-   Payment for the services would be made if a request for payment and
    claim were filed properly and timely, a physician certified that the
    services were necessary, if required, and the provider submitted all
    necessary evidence; or

-   Payment cannot be made because the inpatient deductible or
    coinsurance is higher then the charges.

B.  **Lifetime Reserve Days**

> Part A benefits allow for 60 lifetime reserve days for use after a
> 90-day benefit period has exhausted. The 60 days are not renewable and
> may be used only once during a beneficiary's lifetime. Inpatient
> hospital services count toward the maximum of 60 lifetime reserve days
> under the same conditions as in subsection A except that days are not
> counted if:

-   The individual elects not to have payment made (See the Medicare
    Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 5, Lifetime Reserve Days, §30), or

-   The coinsurance rate exceeds the daily charge. (See the Medicare
    Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 5, Lifetime Reserve Days, §10.2).

C.  **Lifetime Inpatient Psychiatric Hospital Limitation**

> Inpatient psychiatric hospital services count toward the 190-day
> lifetime limitation on inpatient psychiatric hospital services only if
> the conditions in subsection A are met. This limitation does not apply
> to inpatient psychiatric services furnished in a general hospital (or
> distinct part).

D.  **Inpatient Post-hospital Extended Care Services Counting Toward
    Maximums**

> Post-hospital extended care services count toward the maximum number
> of benefit days payable per benefit period only if:

-   Payment for the services is made, or

-   Payment for the services would be made if a request for payment were
    properly filed, the physician certified that the services were
    medically necessary, and the provider submitted all necessary
    evidence.

> When payment cannot be made because of the extended care coinsurance
> requirement, the day(s) used nevertheless count toward the
> beneficiary\'s maximum days of extended care.
