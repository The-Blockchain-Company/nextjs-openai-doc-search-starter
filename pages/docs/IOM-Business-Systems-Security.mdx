> **Key Requirements**
>
> This manual addresses the following key Medicare Fee For Service
> business partner security elements:

-   A business partner is a contractor involved in Medicare
    fee-for-service claims processing

-   An overview of primary roles and responsibilities

-   A program management planning table to assist System Security
    Officers (SSOs) and other security staff in coordinating system
    security programs at business partner sites

-   The collection of CMS policies, procedures, standards, and
    guidelines can be found on the CMS Information Security Web site at:
    [[http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/index.html)
    [[Technology/InformationSecurity/index.html]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/index.html)

-   The specific version of the ARS to be used by the Medicare
    Administrative Contractors (MAC) is the MAC ARS, which is Attachment
    A of this document.

-   As the MACs are designated High Value Assets (HVAs), the CMS
    designated controls for HVA systems are required to be implemented.

> The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provides health
> coverage to more than 100 million people through Medicare, Medicaid,
> the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Health Insurance
> Marketplace. As a Federal agency, the systems used to process data are
> required to follow the Federal Information Security Modernization Act
> (FISMA) of 2014.
>
> FISMA defines three security objectives for information and
> information systems: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
> (CIA). FISMA also directs the promulgation of Federal standards for:
> (i) the security categorization of Federal information and information
> systems based on the objectives of providing appropriate levels of
> information security according to a range of risk levels; and (ii)
> minimum security requirements for information and information systems
> in each such category.
>
> These Federal standards are issued in the form of Federal Information
> Processing Standards (FIPS) 199, Standards for Security Categorization
> of Federal Information and Information Systems, and FIPS 200, Minimum
> Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems,
> respectively.
>
> Using FIPS 199, CMS categorized its information according to
> information type. An information type is a specific category of
> information (e.g., privacy, medical, proprietary, financial,
> investigative, contractor sensitive, security management) defined by
> an organization or, in some instances, by a specific law, Executive
> Order, directive, policy, or regulation.
>
> For each information type, CMS used FIPS 199 to determine its
> associated security category by evaluating the potential impact value
> (e.g., High, Moderate, or Low) for each of the three FISMA security
> objectives---CIA. The resultant security categorization is the CMS
> System Security Level.
>
> This is the basis for assessing the risks to CMS operations and
> assets, and in selecting the appropriate minimum security controls and
> techniques (i.e., MAC Acceptable Risk Safeguards \[ARS\] controls).
>
> Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 200 specifies minimum
> security requirements for information and information systems
> supporting the executive agencies of the federal government and a
> risk-based process for selecting the security controls necessary to
> satisfy the minimum security requirements. To comply with FIPS 200,
> agencies shall first determine the security category (i.e.,
> information type) of their information system in accordance with the
> provisions of FIPS 199, and then apply the appropriate set of baseline
> security controls contained in the current version of NIST SP 800-53.
> Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems.
>
> Agencies have flexibility in applying the baseline security controls
> in accordance with the tailoring guidance provided in NIST SP 800-53.
> This allows agencies, such as CMS, to adjust the security controls to
> more closely fit its mission requirements and operational
> environments.
>
> The CMS Information Security and Privacy Policy contains individual
> policy statements, along with the CMS Minimum Security Requirements,
> provide technical guidance to CMS and its contractors as to the
> minimum level of security controls that shall be implemented to
> protect CMS' information and information systems. These two CMS
> documents, along with other federal and CMS requirements, are used to
> form the basis for the CMS ARS.
>
> The "Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of
> 2003 (MMA) - Section 912: Requirements for Information Security for
> Medicare Administrative Contractors" (Section 912 of the MMA) provided
> for a new type of contractor relationship, the "Medicare
> Administrative Contractor (MAC)," and implemented requirements for
> annual evaluation, testing, and reporting on security programs at both
> MACs and existing carrier and intermediary business partners (to
> include their respective data centers). In this manual, the terms
> "business partner" and "contractor" are used interchangeably, and all
> provisions that apply to business partners also apply to MACs. In
> addition, the term ARS is used in this manual to mean the ARS that
> includes the required security and privacy control baselines and
> tailored with the supplemental controls identified by the Business
> Owner and Information System Security Officer (ISSO). For the MACs,
> this will be known as the MAC ARS.
>
> CMS requires that the MACs, the primary CMS Medicare claims processing
> business partner, implement information security controls on their
> information technology (IT) systems to maintain the CIA of Medicare
> systems operations in the event of computer incidents or physical
> disasters.
>
> A sound entity-wide security program is the cornerstone of effective
> security control implementation and maintenance. Security controls
> cannot be effective without a robust entity-wide security program that
> is fully sponsored and supported by senior management, and staffed by
> individuals with proper training and knowledge.

## - Additional Requirements for MACs

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> MACs are responsible for fulfilling all existing business partner
> requirements. Additional requirements include the following:

-   The contractor shall comply with the CMS MAC tailored list of
    controls found in Attachment 1. This list of controls, known as the
    MAC ARS, includes all of the CMS required controls plus optional
    controls are included specifically for the MACs. MAC ARS

> controls will be tailored via the BPSSM as what is included in the
> BPSSM overrides the MAC ARS controls with the intent of being more
> restrictive.

-   The contractor shall correct weaknesses, findings, gaps, or other
    deficiencies within 90 days of receipt of any final audit or
    evaluation report, unless otherwise authorized by CMS. If additional
    time is required, a milestone to implement mitigating controls must
    be documented prior to requesting the additional time. If the report
    is related to a required HVA assessment, the contractor shall
    correct findings in accordance with CISA remediation requirements.

-   The contractor shall document system security controls in the CMS
    FISMA Controls Tracking System (CFACTS) tool to demonstrate
    compliance with MAC ARS controls and documentation. The contractor
    shall also use CFACTS to maintain documentation that supports the
    Authority to Operate (ATO) process, including certification of the
    documentation.

-   The contractor shall conduct or undergo an independent security
    control assessment of its system security program in accordance with
    Section 912 of the MMA. The first test shall be completed before the
    contractor commences claims payment under the contract.

-   The contractor shall appoint a Chief Information Officer (CIO) to
    oversee its compliance with the CMS information security
    requirements. The contractor's principal Systems Security Officer
    (SSO) shall be a full-time position dedicated to assisting the
    business partner CIO in fulfilling these requirements.

-   The contractor must implement systems in a manner that is compliant
    with the CMS Target Lifecycle (TLC) and the Technical Reference
    Architecture (TRA). When directed by CMS, compliance with the TLC
    and the TRA will be demonstrated by presenting system updates to the
    CMS Technical Review Board (TRB). For situations where the TRA
    conflicts with the MAC ARS, the MAC ARS shall take precedence.

-   The contractor shall meet all contingency planning and disaster
    recovery requirements included in the MAC ARS and the Business
    Partners Systems Security Manual (BPSSM), with the goal of restoring
    key claims processing and operations within 72 hours.

-   The contractor shall review, update and approve all policies and
    procedures every 365 days and not every three years as stated in the
    MAC ARS.

2.  # -- Information Technology (IT) Systems Security Roles and Responsibilities

    1.  ## - Key Personnel Roles

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> The business partners that process Medicare data shall maintain an
> Authority to Operate (ATO) for the information technology systems that
> are used. The ATO requires that certain roles be filled by Federal
> personnel and other roles to be filled by business partner personnel.
> Many of the roles, and the associated responsibilities, are listed in
> the CMS Information Systems Security and Privacy Policy (IS2P2) and
> the HHS Information Systems Security and Privacy Policy
> (IS2P)[^1^](#_bookmark4) manuals.
>
> Some of the key personnel listed in the IS2P2 include:

-   Business Owner (BO)

-   Contracting Officer Representative (COR)

-   Information System Security Officer (ISSO)

-   System Developer Maintainer (SDM)

> In addition to the above roles, the business partner personnel shall
> include a principal System Security Officer (SSO). The SSO position
> for each contractor should be full-time and fully
> qualified---preferably credentialed in systems security (e.g.,
> Certified Information Systems Security Professional \[CISSP\]). Having
> an individual with appropriate education and experience to execute
> security administration duties will help reinforce that security must
> be a cultural norm that guides daily activities, and not a set of
> compliance directives. A qualified SSO who is available to direct
> security operations full-time provides the foundation for the security
> culture and awareness of the organization. The SSO should also
> encourage their systems security personnel to pursue security
> accreditation using available funding.
>
> A business partner may have additional SSOs at various organizational
> levels, but all security actions that affect Medicare operations shall
> be coordinated through the principal SSO. The SSO ensures compliance
> with the CMS information security program and MAC ARS by:

-   Facilitating the Medicare IT system information security program and
    ensuring that necessary safeguards are in place and working

-   Coordinating information security system activities throughout the
    organization

-   Ensuring that IT system information security requirements are
    considered during budget development and execution

> []{#_bookmark4 .anchor}^1^ The HHS IS2P document is available by
> requesting it from your Federal Information System Security Officer

-   Reviewing compliance of all components with the MAC ARS and
    reporting vulnerabilities to management

-   Ensuring an incident response capability is established for
    investigating system security and privacy breaches and reporting
    significant problems (see section 3.6) to business partner
    management and CMS.

-   Ensuring that technical and operational information security
    controls are incorporated into new IT systems by participating in
    and reviewing all new systems/installations and major changes

-   Ensuring that IT systems information security requirements are
    addressed in Requests for Proposal (RFP) and subcontracts involving
    the handling, processing, and/or analysis of Medicare data

-   Maintaining information security documentation in the System
    Security Profile for review by CMS and external auditors and keeping
    all elements of the System Security Profile (see section 3.7)

    Assessment (see section 3.2)

-   Ensuring that an operational IT Systems Contingency Plan (ITSCP) is
    in place and tested (see section 3.3)

-   Documenting and updating the monthly Plan of Action and Milestones
    (POA&M) (see section 3.5.2). Updates may occur whenever a POA&M
    scheduled completion date passes, and/or following the issuance of
    new requirements, risk assessments, internal audits, and external
    evaluations.

-   Ensuring that appropriate safety and control measures are arranged
    with local fire, police, and health agencies for handling
    emergencies (see Appendix A)

## -- Personnel Security/Suitability

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> All business partner and contractor personnel requiring access to CMS
> sensitive information shall meet minimum personnel suitability
> standards. These suitability standards are based on a valid
> need-to-know (not based on position or title) and favorable results
> from a background check. Each position must be evaluated and assigned
> a risk and/or a sensitivity designation commensurate with each
> individual's duties and responsibilities. The background check for
> prospective employees shall include, at a minimum: Social Security
> Number verification, identity and address verification, national
> criminal database search, county criminal records search, HHS list of
> excluded individuals, sex offender registry,
>
> verification of academic records when required for the position and
> verification that the employee has resided in the US for 3 of the past
> 5 years.
>
> When required by CMS, business partner personnel will need to complete
> a Federal Background Investigation (BI). To initiate a BI, business
> partner personnel will need to supply personal information to CMS via
> methods (fingerprint card) or systems identified by CMS. The level of
> investigation for a BI varies and will be determined by the COR's risk
> assessment of the person's role. A BI that results in a favorable
> outcome can result in a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card
> being issued.

# - IT Systems Security Program Management

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> Business partners shall implement an IT Systems Security Program to
> manage the system security risks. Risks are identified by the business
> partner in the Information Security Risk Assessment (see section 3.2)
> and the security requirements are documented in the System Security
> Plan (see
>
> section 3.1). The underlying support for these documents is the
> controls implemented by the business partner. Information system
> security controls shall be implemented in a consistent manner
> everywhere within the system's accreditation boundary to protect the
> CIA of sensitive information. In addition, testing shall be performed
> to ensure that information security controls are operating as
> intended.

## - Control Components

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> Business partners shall have policies and procedures, and implement
> controls or plans that fulfill the MAC ARS controls. The business
> partner Medicare claims related security program shall be based on the
> MAC ARS (IOM 100-17, Attachment 1), the BPSSM (IOM 100-17) and on the
> collection of CMS policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines
> found on the CMS Information Security Web site at:
> [[http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/index.html)
> [[Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/index.html]{.underline}.](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/index.html)
>
> **Policies** are formal, up to date, documented rules that are
> tailored to the environment, are communicated as "shall" or "will"
> statements and are readily available to employees. They establish a
> continuing cycle of assessing risk, implementing controls and
> monitoring for program effectiveness. Policies are written to cover
> all major facilities and operations corporate-wide or for a specific
> asset (e.g., Medicare claims processing), and they are approved by key
> affected parties.
>
> Policies delineate the IT security management structure, clearly
> assign IT security responsibilities, and lay the foundation necessary
> to reliably measure progress and compliance. Policies also identify
> specific penalties and disciplinary actions to be used in the event
> that the policy is not followed.
>
> **Procedures** are formal, up to date, documented instructions that
> are provided to implement the security controls identified by the
> defined policies. They clarify where the action is to be performed,
> how the action is to be performed, when the action is to be performed,
> who is to perform the action, and on what the action is to be
> performed. Procedures clearly define IT security responsibilities and
> expected behaviors for: asset owners and users, information resources
> management and data processing personnel, management, and IT security
> administrators.
>
> Procedures also indicate appropriate individuals to be contacted for
> further information, guidance, and compliance. Finally, procedures
> document the implementation of, and the rigor with which, the control
> is applied.
>
> **Technical Implementations** are the acquisition and installation of
> hardware, software, or assets to be used for the establishment of a
> new control, or the improvement of an existing control. The intention
> of a technical implementation is to automate or facilitate a control
> process that would otherwise be manually performed.
>
> **Standards** are formal, written, mandatory actions, rules, or
> specifications designed to support and conform to a policy or
> procedure. A standard must include one or more accepted specifications
> for configurable items for hardware, software, or behavior. Standards
> are often required to successfully complete technical implementations
> and can be either part of policies and procedures, or can be
> standalone documents. Standards can result from, either exclusively by
> or in combination with, laws promulgated by governing bodies, obtained
> from known standards organization or developed by the business partner
> using industry best practices.
>
> **Management Review** is the business partners' formal oversight
> activity of control implementations and should be performed at various
> management levels. Oversight is a regular activity to verify that the
> control environment for which management has responsibility is
> functioning properly.
>
> Management must set benchmarks or other methods to measure the success
> of controls. Where appropriate, management should document their
> review by formally approving evidence supplied.

## - Reporting Requirements

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> Meeting requirements does not validate the quality of a program.
> Managers with oversight responsibility shall understand the processes
> and methodology behind the requirements. Table 3.1 identifies key
> requirements and their high-level descriptions. As appropriate, Table
> 3.1 refers to other parts of this document that provide details on
> ways to accomplish each requirement.
>
> In addition, Table 3.1 indicates how often these requirements need to
> be performed, the disposition of output or documentation, comments,
> and a space to indicate completion or a "do by" date. The number
> accompanying each entry in the requirement column indicates the
> section in this document that deals with that particular requirement.
> Use this table as a checklist to ensure that all required IT systems
> security tasks are completed on schedule. Consult the referenced
> sections for clarifying details.

## - System Security Plan (SSP)

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> The objective of an information security program is to improve the
> protection of sensitive/critical IT resources. All business partner
> systems used to process, transmit, or store Medicare-related data have
> some level of sensitivity and require protection. The protection of a
> system shall be documented in a SSP. The completion of a SSP is a
> requirement of the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2014
> (FISMA), Privacy Act of 1974, As Amended, Office of Management and
> Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information
> Resources, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information
> Resources, and Public Law 100-235, the Computer Security Act of 1987.
> All Medicare claims-related applications and systems categorized as
> either an MA or GSS shall be covered by SSPs.
>
> The purpose of a SSP is to provide an overview of the security
> requirements of a system and describe the controls that are
> implemented to meet those requirements. The SSP also delineates
> responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals who access
> the system. The SSP should be viewed as documentation of the
> structured process of planning adequate and cost-effective security
> protection for a system. It should reflect input from various managers
> with responsibilities concerning the system, including Business
> Owners, information owners, the system operator, and the system
> security manager (i.e., SSO).
>
> All business partners are required to maintain current security plans
> for their Medicare claims- related GSSs and MAs in both the CFACTS and
> their System Security Profiles. The SSP documents the current level of
> security within the system or application; that is, actual implemented
> controls, not planned controls. In addition, the SSP serves as the
> primary documentation reference for testing and evaluation, whether by
> CMS, the General Accounting Office (GAO), or other oversight bodies.
> The SSP is a sensitive document, as it may discuss uncorrected
> vulnerabilities and may mention risks that have been accepted.
> Therefore, security plans should be distributed only on a need-to-know
> basis.
>
> The SSP shall be recertified by business partner management and the
> signed copy made available to the SSO and authorized external auditors
> as required. The SSO and business partner are responsible for
> reviewing the SSP on an annual basis to ensure that it is up to date.
> The objective of these annual reviews is to verify that the controls
> selected or installed remain adequate to provide a level of protection

## -- Information Security Risk Assessment (ISRA)

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> The CMS procedures present a systematic approach for the ISRA process
> for Medicare information computer systems within the CMS and business
> partner environments. The procedure describes the steps required to
> produce an ISRA for systems and applications.
>
> All business and information owners shall develop, implement, and
> maintain risk management programs to ensure that appropriate
> safeguards are taken to protect all CMS resources. A risk-based
> approach shall be used to determine adequate security and shall
> include a consideration of the major factors in management, such as
> the value of the system or application, all threats, all
> vulnerabilities, and the effectiveness of current or proposed
> safeguards. The CMS risk assessment procedures shall be used to
> prepare an annual ISRA.
>
> ISRAs shall be recertified within 365 days from the previous
> certification date. The ISRA shall also be reviewed prior to
> recertification (within the original certification timeframe) to
> determine whether an update is required. The ISRA shall be updated if
> there has been a significant change or the security posture has
> changed. Examples of significant change include, but are not limited
> to: transition from one standard system to another, replacement of
> major computer equipment, change in operating system used, change in
> system boundaries, or any significant system modifications that may
> impact the system's security posture. Documentation of the review or
> the updated ISRA, if applicable, shall be placed in the System
> Security Profile, and a copy shall be submitted to the CMS Central
> Office. Note that the ISRA used to support a security plan cannot be
> dated more than 365 days earlier than the security plan certification
> date.
>
> Contractors that must update their current ISRA shall use the most
> current versions of the CMS procedures and templates.
>
> A newly developed or updated ISRA that is submitted with the security
> plan shall be maintained in the CFACTS within 10 working days after
> they have been developed and/or updated.
>
> The ISRA shall be updated every 365 days unless there are changes (as
> discussed above) that would necessitate a more frequent update. Should
> ISRA technical assistance be required, direct all questions to the CMS
> Information Security and Privacy Group (ISPG) at
> [[mailto:CISO@cms.hhs.gov]{.underline}.](mailto:CISO@cms.hhs.gov)
>
> Technical Limitations - In the event that a technical limitation
> prevents compliance with an ARS control, MACs should consult with CMS
> and the guidance for documenting a Technical Limitation
> Acknowledgement (TLA). If possible, the related control or
> configuration should be set as restrictive as possible.

## -- IT Systems Contingency Plan (ITSCP)

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> All business partners are required to develop and document an ITSCP
> that describes the arrangements that have been implemented and the
> steps that shall be taken to continue IT and system operations in the
> event of a natural or human-caused disaster. The ITSCP shall be
> included in management planning and shall be:

-   Reviewed as part of a documented System Development Life Cycle,
    whenever new systems are planned or upon significant change

-   Reviewed when new safeguards are implemented

-   Reviewed and approved within 365 days to ensure accuracy

-   Tested within 365 days. If backup facility testing is done by
    Medicare contract type (i.e., when multiple contract types are
    involved \[e.g., Data Center, Part A/B, DME\]), each individual
    Medicare contract type shall be tested every 365 days.

> Updated plans and test reports (results) shall be maintained in
> CFACTS, and placed in the contractor's System Security Profile.
> Business partner management and the SSO shall approve newly developed
> and/or updated ITSCPs. A newly developed and/or updated IT Systems CP
> shall be updated in CFACTS and submitted to CMS within 10 business
> days after the business partner's management and SSO have approved it.
>
> Appendix A to this manual provides information on ITSCP and testing
> methods. Also, see Table
>
> 3.1 for additional information.

## -- Certification Package for Internal Controls (CPIC)

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> All business partners are required to certify their system security
> compliance. Certification is the formal process by which a contractor
> official verifies, initially and then by annual reassessments, that a
> system's security features meet the MAC ARS controls. Business
> partners shall self-certify that their organization successfully
> completed an annual, independent FA of their Medicare IT systems and
> associated software in accordance with the terms of their Medicare
> agreement/contract.
>
> Each contractor is required to self-certify to CMS its information
> security compliance within each federal Fiscal Year (FY). This
> security certification shall be included in the CPIC or, for contracts
> not required to submit CPICs, send the security certification to their
> appropriate CMS CORs. CMS shall continue to require annual, formal
> re-certifications within each FY no later than September 30, including
> validation at all levels of security as described in this manual.
>
> System security certification shall be fully documented and maintained
> in the System Security Profile. The security certification validates
> that the following items have been developed (i.e., updated and/or
> reviewed, as required) and are available for review in the System
> Security Profile:

-   Certification

-   FISMA Annual Security Control Assessment

-   System Security Plan for each GSS and MA (see section 3.1)

-   Information Security Risk Assessment (see section 3.2)

-   IT Systems Contingency Plan (see section 3.3 and Appendix A)

-   Plan of Action and Milestones (see section 3.5.2)

    1.  ## - Compliance

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> Compliance refers to the contractual obligations of business partners
> to CMS. The components to comply with IT security requirements are
> described in detail in the following subsections.

## - Annual FISMA Assessment (FA)

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> A critical factor for maintaining on-going compliance with FISMA and
> the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA) is for
> Business Owners in coordination with developers/maintainers, to
> annually test their internal controls and dedicate sufficient
> resources to accomplish this test. These resources include budget (if
> external resources are to be used to support the testing) and
> person-hours (if internal personnel are to be engaged in this
> activity). They are
>
> required to schedule and perform the test; and oversee the development
> and completion of applicable POA&Ms for vulnerabilities noted during
> the annual testing.
>
> The annual FA is documented, tracked, and reported in the CFACTS. The
> purpose of annual FA testing (i.e., validation) is to examine and
> analyze implemented security safeguards in order to provide evidence
> of compliance with applicable laws, directives, policies, and
> requirements regarding information security. The annual FA is intended
> to validate the MAC ARS controls to determine the extent to which the
> controls are:

-   implemented correctly

-   operating as intended

-   producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security
    requirements for the system

> The annual FA testing requirement has been interpreted by OMB as being
> within 365 calendar days of the prior test. Over a 3-year period, all
> MAC ARS controls applicable to a system or application shall be
> tested. This means a subset (no less than one-third \[^1^/3\]) of the
> MAC ARS controls shall be tested each year so that all security
> controls are tested during a 3-year period. In an effort to
> standardize testing and results summarization, a 3-year rotation of
> MAC ARS control families was established by CMS. After the 3-year
> rotation is completed, the testing rotation shall be repeated until
> notification from CMS is received. As control families are added or
> removed, CMS reserves the right to change the controls that must be
> tested each year.
>
> To fulfill the annual FA validation obligation, the FA shall be
> conducted by an independent agent or team. This can be any
> internal/external agent or team that is capable of conducting an
> impartial assessment of an organization's information system.
> Impartiality implies that the assessors are free from any perceived or
> actual conflicts of interest with respect to the development,
> operation, and/or management chain of command associated with the
> information system or to the determination of MAC ARS effectiveness.
> All management-directed and independent testing conducted within
>
> 365 days of the attestation due date may be used to meet the
> requirement for the annual security controls (i.e., FA) testing.

## - Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)

> ***(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22;
> Implementation:04-03-23)***

## - Background

> FISMA requires that federal agencies provide annual reporting of the
> state of security programs for all IT systems associated with the
> agency. Additionally, periodic POA&Ms reporting the status of known
> security weaknesses for all federal agency systems are also submitted
> to the OMB. This reporting requirement applies to a broader scope of
> security weaknesses, as it is not limited to
>
> weaknesses identified by specific audits and reviews (such as those
> covered under FMFIA). In the case of FISMA, any security weakness
> identified for any covered system shall be recorded in CFACTS.
>
> Section 912 of the MMA implemented requirements for annual evaluation,
> testing, and reporting on security programs for MAC business partners
> (to include their respective data centers). These Section 912
> evaluations and reports necessitate an annual on-site review of
> business partner security programs to ensure that they meet the
> information security requirements imposed by FISMA and CMS. CMS, as
> part of its overall FISMA reporting obligations, requires that
> corrective actions for identified deficiencies (i.e., weaknesses) be
> addressed in a report to be submitted shortly after the evaluation
> results are finalized, as well as periodically thereafter to track
> updated progress towards completion of the identified action plans.
>
> The CFACTS enables contractors to satisfy reporting requirements for
> security and privacy related findings. Security and privacy related
> findings and approved action plan data is promptly entered into the
> CFACTS following all audits/reviews.

## - POA&M Components/Submission Format

> (Rev. 11, Issued: 09-30-11, Effective: 10-31-11, Implementation:
> 10-31-11)
>
> The CFACTS shall be populated and maintained with security and privacy
> related findings and action plans from any audit or review, whether
> internal or external. Corrective actions are to be established in the
> CFACTS to address all resulting weaknesses entered therein, and those
> corrective actions shall be maintained current in the CFACTS to
> support reporting requirements. In addition to the initial POA&M
> reporting that follows each audit/review, ongoing milestones for all
> corrective action plans will be updated on the 1^st^ business day of
> each month.
>
> **Initial Reporting.** Within 30 calendar days (or as otherwise
> directed by CMS) of the final results for every internal/external
> audit/review, an initial POA&M is due to CMS that describes the
> findings of the audit/review and initial corrective actions planned
> for implementation.
>
> **Monthly Reporting.** On a monthly basis, business partners shall
> provide updates in the CFACTS on progress towards completion of
> remediation efforts for weaknesses identified from all known sources.

## - Timing Requirements for Compliance Conditions

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> In the MAC ARS, many security documents and processes require timely
> execution on a yearly, bi- annual (every 6 months), quarterly,
> monthly, weekly or daily basis. In order to assure that these
> documents/processes are reviewed/processed timely, the following
> timing requirements apply:

-   Yearly/365 days: Any document/process to be reviewed on a yearly
    basis shall be performed within the same month each year. For
    example, if you review your ISRA or ITSCP on February 14^th^, then
    the next review must take place within the month of February during
    subsequent years. This can be applied to reviews to be performed
    over multiple years. If you perform a review in February and a
    review is due 3 years later, it must be performed within the month
    of February for the year when the review is to be performed again.
    The only exceptions to this annual/yearly compliance condition are
    deliverables whose annual due date are set and distributed by CMS,
    such as the annual FA submission.

-   Bi-Annual/Every 6 Months/180 days: The months designated for a
    6-month document/process review shall occur every 6 months and be
    consistent from year to year. For example, if you perform an initial
    review during February, then the next review must be performed
    within the month of August. In subsequent years, the review must be
    performed within the months of February and August. Those months
    then become your standard months for performing the review.

-   Quarterly/90 days: The months designated for a quarterly
    document/process review shall occur every 3 months and be consistent
    from year to year. A quarterly document/process review shall be
    scheduled on the same day of each designated month and be performed
    within 4 business days\*\* before or after the scheduled review date
    of those months. That is, if you choose July 16 as your review date,
    then your review date will be the 16 in each designated month. The
    following table demonstrates when quarterly reviews must be
    performed based on the day your scheduled review date occurs.

+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| > Earliest Review    | > Review Target Day  | > Latest Review       |
+======================+======================+=======================+
| > Previous Tuesday   | > Monday             | > Following Friday    |
+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| > Previous Wednesday | > Tuesday            | > Following Monday    |
+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| > Previous Thursday  | > Wednesday          | > Following Tuesday   |
+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| > Previous Friday    | > Thursday           | > Following Wednesday |
+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| > Previous Monday    | > Friday             | > Following Thursday  |
+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+

> \*\*Federal holidays or incidental office closures will not affect
> these timeframes.

-   Monthly/30 days: The document/process review shall be performed
    within 2 business days\*\* before or after the scheduled review date
    each month. The exact date of the monthly review shall not change
    month to month. That is, if you choose July 16^th^ as your review
    date, then your review date will be the 16^th^ in every subsequent
    month. The following table demonstrates when monthly reviews must be
    performed based on the day your scheduled review date occurs.

+----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| > Earliest Review    | > Review Target Day   | > Latest Review       |
+======================+=======================+=======================+
| > Previous Thursday  | > Monday              | > Following Wednesday |
+----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| > Previous Friday    | > Tuesday             | > Following Thursday  |
+----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| > Previous Monday    | > Wednesday           | > Following Friday    |
+----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| > Previous Tuesday   | > Thursday            | > Following Monday    |
+----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| > Previous Wednesday | > Friday              | > Following Tuesday   |
+----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

> \*\*Federal holidays or incidental office closures will not affect
> these timeframes.

-   Weekly/7 days: Weekly/7 days document/process reviews shall be
    performed on the same day every week. If the scheduled review day
    falls on a holiday, the previous or subsequent business day can be
    used as your review target date, returning to the original target
    date in subsequent weeks.

-   Daily/24 hours: Daily/24 hours document/process reviews shall be
    performed on the next business day. If the day of the scheduled
    review falls on a Saturday, then the review is performed on a
    Monday. If the day of the scheduled review falls on a federal
    holiday or an incidental office closure, then the review is
    performed the next business day. This may cause more than one review
    to be performed on the same day.

> If the business partner wishes to change the timing cycle of a review,
> the business partner is required to shorten the timing cycle and not
> lengthen the timing cycle to attain the new performance date. For
> example, if the annual/yearly review of the security plan is being
> performed in June during year 1 and the business partner desired to
> change the review date for year 2, they would be
>
> required to review the security plan in a month prior to June. That
> month would then become the review month going forward.
>
> Exceptions to the timing requirements can be implemented with the
> approval of the CMS ISSO. These can be one-time exceptions (e.g., a
> yearly review of a disaster recovery test is performed after an
> established month due to scheduling issues with the recovery
> facility).

## - Security Incident Reporting and Response

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> NIST Special Publication 800-61r2 defines a computer security incident
> as a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security
> policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.
> Examples of incidents are:

-   An attacker commands a botnet to send high volumes of connection
    requests to a web server, causing it to crash.

-   Users are tricked into opening a "quarterly report" sent via email
    that is actually malware; running the tool has infected their
    computers and established connections with an external host.

-   An attacker obtains sensitive data and threatens that the details
    will be released publicly if the organization does not pay a
    designated sum of money.

-   A user provides or exposes sensitive information to others through
    peer-to-peer file sharing services.

> An "imminent threat of violation" refers to a situation in which the
> organization has a factual basis for believing that a specific
> incident is about to occur. For example, the antivirus software
> maintainers may receive a bulletin from the software vendor, warning
> them of new malware that is rapidly spreading across the Internet.
>
> The business partner shall use its security policy and procedures to
> determine whether a non- reportable event or a reportable security
> incident has occurred. Examples of non-reportable events include a
> user connecting to a file share, a server receiving a request for a
> web page, a user sending email or a firewall blocking a connection
> attempt. Upon receiving notification of an IT systems security
> incident or a suspected incident, the SSO or another identified
> individual shall immediately perform an analysis to determine if an
> incident actually occurred. The incident should be evaluated to
> determine if it impacts the processing of Medicare data or the
> confidentiality, integrity and availability of Medicare data.
>
> All suspected security incidents or events shall be reported to the
> business partner's IT service desk (or equivalent business partner
> function) as soon as an incident comes to the attention of an
> information system user. All security incidents and events shall be
> reported to the CMS IT Service Desk in accordance with the procedures
> set forth in the CMS RMH Chapter 8 Incident Response.
>
> This document is available on the CMS Information Security Web site at
> [[http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/index.html)

> [[mailto:CMS_IT_Service_Desk@cms.hhs.gov]{.underline}.](mailto:CMS_IT_Service_Desk@cms.hhs.gov)
> Contacting the CMS IT Service Desk by telephone is recommended if
> immediate action by CMS is required. In addition, MACs shall also
> email each incident report to
> [[mailto:Security_Incident@cms.hhs.gov]{.underline}](mailto:Security_Incident@cms.hhs.gov)
> .
>
> When reporting confirmed security incidents, business partners shall
> report the date and time when events occurred or were first
> discovered; names of systems, programs, or networks affected by the
> incident; and impact analysis. Release of information during incident
> handling shall be on an as- needed and need-to-know basis. When other
> entities should be notified of incidents at external business partner
> sites, CMS will coordinate with legal and public affairs contacts at
> the effected entities. If a violation of the law is suspected, CMS
> will notify the Office of Inspector General (OIG) Computer Crime Unit
> and submit a report to the Federal Computer Incident Response
> Capability (FedCIRC) of the incident with a copy to the CMS CISO.
>
> As part of the risk management process, the business partner shall
> determine the extent of the incident's impact and the potential for
> new or enhanced controls required to mitigate newly identified
> threats. These new security controls (and associated threats and
> impacts) should provide additional input into the business partner's
> ISRA. Business partners shall refer to CMS RMH Chapter 8 Incident
> Response manual for further guidance.
>
> Many of the PII breaches being reported to CMS occur when unencrypted
> emails are sent to the intended recipients. A mitigating control to
> allow many of these breaches to be closed more easily is the
> implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol within
> email servers such as Microsoft Exchange. The TLS protocol encrypts
> emails for transmission between two email servers. There are different
> TLS features which can be used and provide different levels of
> assurance that an email will be encrypted. Use of any of these
> features requires TLS to be enabled. To mitigate the severity of email
> PII breaches, business partners are required to enable TLS on their
> email servers. In addition, the most secure TLS feature that can be
> enabled to encrypt emails between business partners shall be
> implemented. If a business partner cannot implement TLS, a risk must
> be documented in the RA.

## - System Security Profile

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> Consolidate security documentation (paper documents, electronic
> documents, or a combination) into a System Security Profile that
> includes the following items:

-   Completed FAs

-   Security Plans (for each GSS and MA)

-   Risk Assessments

-   Certifications

-   Contingency Plans

-   POA&Ms for each compliance security review

-   POA&Ms for other security review undertaken by Department of Health
    and Human Services (HHS) OIG, CMS, Internal Revenue Service (IRS),
    GAO, consultants, subcontractors, and business partner security
    staff

-   Incident reporting and responses

-   Systems information security policies and procedures

> The System Security Profile shall be kept in a secure location, kept
> up to date, and pointers to other relevant documents maintained. A
> backup copy of the System Security Profile shall be kept at a secure
> off-site storage location, preferably at the site where back-up tapes
> and/or back-up facilities are located. The back-up copy of the profile
> shall also be kept up to date, particularly the contingency plan
> documents.

## - Authorization To Operate

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> Business partners are required to acquire and maintain a CMS
> CIO-issued Authorization to Operate (ATO) for each FISMA system. To
> maintain an ATO, the business partner is expected to maintain all
> security documentation in CFACTS, and the documentation must be up to
> date as defined in BPSSM table 3.1. When applying for an ATO, critical
> and high risk POA&Ms must be in either a pending verification status
> or mitigated so the risk can be demonstrated to be moderate or low.

2.  []{#_bookmark25 .anchor}**-- Identity Proofing**

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> Business partners shall assure that users are effectively identity
> proofed in accordance with ARS control requirements. To assure that
> users are properly identified and validated, it is imperative that
> business partners apply consistent identity proofing concepts.
>
> To properly identity proof users, business partners shall implement a
> process that meets the requirements identified within NIST 800-63A and
> meets or exceeds standards for IAL2.
>
> It is not a requirement that identity proofing be done in person.
>
> Exceptions and situations that require further clarification should be
> discussed with CMS before implementing.

## - Patch Management

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> Timely patching is critical to maintaining the operational CIA of
> Medicare systems. However, failure to keep operating system and
> application software patched is the most common mistake made by IT
> professionals. New patches are released daily and it is often
> difficult for even experienced system administrators to keep abreast
> of all the new patches
>
> To help address this growing problem, CMS recommends that business
> partners have an explicit and documented patching and vulnerability
> policy and a systematic, accountable, and documented process for
> handling patches. The MAC ARS provides specific guidance on time
> frames for implementing patches. Further guidance is provided in Table
> 3.3 below for 1) Patch Identification,

## - End of Life Technology Components

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> The current HHS policy states "Operating systems, software and
> applications are considered end- of-life (EOL) when they are no longer
> supported by the vendor/provider and do not receive product updates
> and security patches." Standard HHS contract language requires that
> vendor software needs "to be within one major version of the current
> version". To address both the HHS policy and the HHS contract
> language, and to document how the business partner has implemented the
> EOL control, business partners need to implement MAC ARS control
> SA-22, which restricts the use of unsupported information system
> components. For business partners, components are defined as any
> hardware or software used by the FISMA system.
>
> While paying for extended support to receive security updates for all
> levels of severity (with a component vendor or a third-party vendor)
> is acceptable for meeting the HHS policy regarding EOL, business
> partners are expected to plan for and remove components that the
> vendor plans to, or currently no longer supplies security updates. If
> vendors can only provide updates or fixes for certain levels of
> security flaws (e.g. critical only), this could leave security threats
> and risks present in the environment and would not be acceptable for
> meeting the HHS policy regarding EOL.
>
> Business partners shall demonstrate their efforts to remove these
> components, with documentation that can include, but is not limited
> to, vendor notifications, project plans and identified issues. If the
> components cannot be removed before security updates end because the
> vendor provided limited notice or because removal requires a long-term
> project, then the business partner shall work with CMS to implement
> controls to mitigate risk to an acceptable level until the component
> can be replaced. If the risk cannot be sufficiently reduced, the
> business partner shall work with CMS to open a POA&M, if necessary,
> prior to the end of support. In addition, business partners are
> required to be on either the current or the one prior major version of
> the component. For those situations where the business partner wants
> to use previous versions, and the component is supported by the

## - Wireless Access Monitoring

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> As outlined in the MAC ARS, wireless access to a MAC network is not

> AC-18 also states that an organization must monitor for unauthorized
> wireless access. Business partners must have a program in place to
> fulfill this requirement and have associated policies and procedures

> capable of identifying unauthorized wireless devices or access points
> that could be providing access to the network. Monitoring activities
> should be performed on a periodic basis as needed, but at least
> quarterly to confirm that unauthorized wireless access does not exist
> and/or is removed. If wireless access to the environment has been

## - Malicious Code Protection

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> MAC ARS SI-3 requires that malicious code protection mechanisms be in

-   Documenting change management processes to confirm that rule changes
    were reviewed, tested, and approved.

-   Comparing current rulesets to secured backups to validate that no
    unauthorized changes have occurred.

-   Verifying known insecure protocols and potentially unnecessary IP
    addresses are being restricted.

> results. If it is impossible to recreate the AI results with 100%
> accuracy, then tolerances need to be documented.

-   Periodic assessment is required -- Certain data may be used to
    initially seed the AI, but as conditions change, additional data may
    need to be added or some data may need to be removed or modified. As
    changes are made, associated policies and procedures may need to be
    updated.

-   AI account management -- AI tools may bring complexity with accounts
    needed to operate effectively. Management should treat any account,
    even those used for AI, with the same security requirements as their
    other user, service, and administrative accounts.

-   AI external connections -- AI tools should be evaluated to determine
    if the tool operation or the data being analyzed is being sent
    outside of the organization-controlled network (e.g. cloud
    repository). If so, CMS should be consulted prior to implementation.

-   In the event that the AI tool being implemented cannot align exactly
    to part of a MAC ARS control, management should evaluate if the tool
    has addressed the risk of the requirement. If the tool addresses the
    risk but the implementation is different than what the MAC ARS
    identifies, this should be documented within the organizations SSP
    and policies. If the tool does not address the risk, then management
    may need to determine if additional control implementations are
    needed to fully address that MAC ARS control. MACs should consult
    with CMS if a technical limitation is encountered.

# - Information And Information Systems Security

> ***(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22;
> Implementation:04-03-23)***

## - Sensitive Information Protection Requirement

> Business partners are responsible for implementing the Minimum
> Protection Standards (MPS) for all CMS sensitive information (digital
> and non-digital) and information systems categorized at the "HIGH"
> security level designation. The MPS establishes a uniform method for
> protecting data and items that require safeguarding. The MPS applies
> to all IT facilities, areas, or systems processing, storing, or
> transmitting CMS sensitive information (i.e., any information
> categorized as "HIGH") in any form or on any media.
>
> Care must be taken to deny unauthorized access to areas containing
> sensitive systems and information during working and non-working
> hours. This can be accomplished by creating restricted areas, security
> rooms, or locked rooms. Additionally, sensitive information in any
> form (computer printout, photocopies, tapes, notes, etc.) must be
> protected during non-duty hours. This can be done through a
> combination of methods: secured or locked perimeter, secured area, or
> containerization.

## - Restricted Area

> A restricted area is a secured area whose entry is restricted to
> authorized personnel (individuals assigned to the area). All
> restricted areas shall either meet secured area criteria or provisions
> shall be made to store CMS sensitive items in appropriate containers
> during non-working hours. The use of restricted areas is an effective
> method for eliminating unnecessary traffic through critical areas,
> thereby reducing the opportunity for unauthorized disclosure or theft
> of sensitive information. All of the following procedures must be
> implemented to qualify as a restricted area.
>
> Restricted areas shall be indicated by prominently posted signs and
> separated from non-restricted areas by physical barriers that control
> access. The number of entrances should be kept to a minimum and each
> entrance shall have controlled access (e.g., electronic access
> control, key access, door monitor) to prevent unauthorized entry. The
> main entrance should be controlled by a responsible employee
> positioned at the entrance to enforce the restriction of access to
> authorized personnel accompanied by one or more officials.
>
> When unescorted, a restricted area register shall be maintained at a
> designated entrance to the restricted area and all visitors (persons
> not assigned to the area) entering the area shall be directed to the
> designated entrance. Visitors entering the area shall enter (in ink)
> in the register: their name, signature, assigned work area, escort,
> purpose of entry, and time and date of entry.
>
> The entry control monitor shall verify the identity of visitors by
> comparing the name and signature entered in the register with the name
> and signature of some type of photo identification card, such as a
> driver's license. When leaving the area, the entry control monitor or
> escort shall enter the visitor\'s time of departure. Each restricted
> area register shall be closed out at the end of each month and
> reviewed by the area supervisor/manager.
>
> To facilitate the entry of employees who have a frequent and
> continuing need to enter a restricted area, but are not assigned to
> the area, an authorized access list (AAL) can be maintained. Each
> month a new AAL shall be posted and vendors shall be required to sign
> the register. If there is any
>
> doubt on the identity of the individual prior to permitting entry,
> their identity shall be verified prior to permitting entry.

## - Security Room

> A security room is a room that has been constructed to resist forced
> entry. The primary purpose of a security room is to store protectable
> material. The entire room shall be enclosed by slab-to-slab walls
> constructed of approved materials (e.g., masonry brick, dry wall,
> etc.) and supplemented by periodic inspection. All doors for entering
> the security room shall be locked with locking systems meeting the
> requirements set forth below (section 4.2.5, Locking Systems). Entry
> is limited to specifically authorized personnel.
>
> Door hinge pins shall be non-removable or installed on the inside of
> the room. Any glass in doors or walls shall be security glass (a
> minimum of two layers of 1/8 inch plate glass with .060 inch \[1/32\]
> vinyl interlayer, nominal thickness shall be 5/16 inch). Plastic
> glazing material is not acceptable. Vents and louvers shall be
> protected by an Underwriters\' Laboratory (UL)-approved electronic
> Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that annunciates at a protection
> console, UL-approved central station, or local police station; and the
> IDS shall be given top priority for guard/police response during any
> alarm situation.
>
> Whenever cleaning and/or maintenance are performed, and sensitive
> systems and/or information may be accessible, the cleaning and/or
> maintenance shall be done in the presence of an authorized employee.

## - Secured Area (Secured Interior/Secured Perimeter)

> Secured areas are interior areas or exterior perimeters which have
> been designed to prevent undetected entry by unauthorized persons
> during working and non-working hours. Personnel may not reside in
> computer rooms and/or areas containing sensitive information unless
> that individual is authorized to access that sensitive information. To
> qualify as a secured area, the area shall meet the following minimum
> standards:

-   Enclosed by slab-to-slab walls constructed of approved materials and
    supplemented by periodic inspection or other approved protection
    methods, or any lesser-type partition supplemented by UL-approved
    electronic IDS and fire detection systems.

-   Unless electronic IDS devices are used, all doors entering the space
    shall be locked and strict key or combination control should be
    exercised.

-   In the case of a fence/gate, the fence shall have IDS devices or be
    continually guarded, and the gate shall be either guarded or locked
    with intrusion alarms.

-   The space shall be cleaned during working hours in the presence of a
    regularly assigned employee.

    1.  ## - Container

> The term container includes all file cabinets (both vertical and
> lateral), safes, supply cabinets, open and closed shelving, desk and
> credenza drawers, carts, or any other piece of office equipment
> designed for the storage of files, documents, papers, or equipment.
> Some of these containers are designed for storage only and do not
> provide any protection value (e.g., open shelving). For
>
> purposes of providing protection, containers can be grouped into three
> general categories: locked containers, security containers, and safes
> or vaults.

## - Locked Container

> A locked container is a commercially available or prefabricated metal
> cabinet or box with riveted or welded seams, or metal desks with
> lockable drawers. The lock mechanism may be either a built-in key, or
> a hasp and lock. A hasp is a hinged metal fastening attached to the
> cabinet, drawer, etc. that is held in place by a pin or padlock.

## - Security Container

> Security containers are metal containers that are lockable and have a
> tested resistance to penetration. To maintain the integrity of the
> security container, key locks should have only two keys and strict
> control of the keys is mandatory. If combinations are used, they shall
> be given only to those individuals who have a need to access the
> container. Security containers include the following:

-   Metal lateral key lock files

-   Metal lateral files equipped with lock bars on both sides and
    secured with security padlocks

-   Metal pull drawer cabinets with center or off-center lock bars
    secured by security padlocks

-   Key lock "Mini Safes" properly mounted with appropriate key control

> If the central core of a security container lock is replaced with a
> non-security lock core, then the container no longer qualifies as a
> security container.

## - Safe/Vault

> A safe/vault is not required for storage of CMS sensitive information.
> However, if used, they shall meet the following requirements:

-   A safe is a GSA-approved container of Class I, IV, or V, or UL
    listings of TRTL-30 or TRTL-60.

-   A vault is a hardened room with typical construction of reinforced
    concrete floors, walls, and ceilings that uses UL-approved vault
    doors and meets GSA specifications.

## - Locking System

> The lock is the most accepted and widely used security device for
> protecting installations and activities, personnel data, sensitive
> data, classified material and government and personal property. All
> containers, rooms, buildings, and facilities containing vulnerable or
> sensitive items shall be locked when not in actual use. However,
> regardless of their quality or cost, locks should be considered as
> delay devices only and not complete deterrents. Therefore, locking
> system must be planned and used in conjunction with other security
> measures.
>
> Minimum requirements for locking systems for secured areas and
> security rooms are high-security pin-tumbler cylinder locks that meet
> the following requirements:

-   Key-operated mortised or rim-mounted deadbolt lock

-   Have a deadbolt throw of one inch or longer

-   Double-cylinder design; cylinders have five or more pin tumblers

-   Contains hardened inserts or inserts made of steel if bolt is
    visible when locked

-   Both the key and lock shall be "off-master"

> Convenience-type locking devices such as card keys, sequenced
> button-activated locks used in conjunction with electric strikes,
> etc., are authorized for use only during working hours. Keys to
> secured areas not in the personal custody of an authorized employee
> and any combinations shall be stored in a security container. The
> number of keys or persons with knowledge of the combination to a
> secured area shall be kept to a minimum.

## - Physical Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

> Physical IDSs are designed to detect attempted breaches of perimeter
> areas. Physical IDS devices can be used in conjunction with other
> measures to provide forced entry protection for non-working hour
> security. Additionally, alarms for individual and document safety
> (fire), and other physical hazards (water pipe breaks) are
> recommended. Alarms shall annunciate at an on-site protection console,
> a central station, or local police station. Physical IDS devices
> include, but are not limited to: door and window contacts, magnetic
> switches, motion detectors, and sound detectors, that are designed to
> set off an alarm at a given location when the sensor is disturbed.

## - Minimum Protection Alternatives

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> The objective of the MPS is to prevent unauthorized access to CMS
> sensitive information. MPS requires two barriers to accessing
> sensitive information under normal security. The reason for the two
> barriers is to provide an additional layer of protection to deter,
> delay, or detect surreptitious entry. Because local factors may
> require additional security measures, management shall analyze local
> circumstances to determine space, container, and other security needs
> at individual facilities.
>
> Table 4.1 shall be used to determine the minimum protection
> alternatives required to protect CMS sensitive information. Note that
> any of the three alternative protection standards is acceptable
> whenever all of the applicable perimeter, interior area, and/or
> container standards are met. The protection alternative methods are
> not listed in any order of preference or security significance.

## - Encryption Requirements for Data Leaving Data Centers

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> CMS, as a trusted custodian of individual health care data, must
> protect its most valuable assets--- its information and its
> information systems. Consequently, CMS believes that putting the
> government's credibility at risk is not acceptable.
>
> No data that includes personally identifiable information (PII) shall
> be transported from a CMS data center (including business partner data
> centers and subcontractor data centers) unless it has been encrypted
> in accordance with CMS standards. The only exception to this
> requirement is for hardcopy records that are transported to and from
> an off-site location and between off-site locations. To qualify for
> this exception, the controls listed below (additional information is
> available from CMS) shall be used.
>
> To prepare the records for shipment:

-   The records shall be stored in boxes.

-   Each box shall be uniquely identified.

-   Boxes shall be secured for shipment.

-   Secured boxes shall be loaded into the shipping container or
    vehicle.

-   Total items in each shipment shall be noted and the Bill of Lading
    signed.

-   At time of pickup, the shipping company representative shall verify
    and sign the Bill of Lading.

-   A copy of the identification records shall accompany each shipment.

-   The shipping container or vehicle shall be locked and sealed with
    the seal number noted on the Bill of Lading.

-   A copy of the completed Bill of Lading shall be kept by the
    contractor.

> Upon receipt of the shipment at the storage facility:

-   A storage facility representative shall verify the seal number and
    that it is unbroken.

-   Compare the contents of the shipment against the Bill of Lading and
    the boxes against the copy of the identification record.

-   If any discrepancies are found, the discrepancy shall be immediately
    resolved.

-   After verification that all boxes shipped were received, information
    from the Bill of Lading shall be sent to the shipper where it shall
    be verified.

-   Within 24 hours, all boxes on each shipment shall be scanned into
    the storage facility's tracking system and inserted into the storage
    racks.

# -- Secure Use of the Internet

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> With prior written approval of their sponsoring CMS Business Owner,
> business partners may use the Internet for transmission of and/or
> receipt of health care transactions. Each request for using the
> Internet to conduct CMS business functions will be considered
> individually and approval is not automatic. However, any approval
> shall require that business partners meet CMS architectural, security,
> data interchange, and privacy requirements for Internet-facing
> infrastructure. Further, an independent (third-party) assessment of
> security controls of the new functionality prior to its release into
> production is required and the assessment must include penetration
> testing. The assessment must be conducted to validate compliance with
> the following specific architectural, security, data interchange, and
> privacy requirements, as well as the MAC ARS. The existing requirement
> for an annual penetration test of the contractor network shall include
> any approved Internet infrastructure within the FISMA boundary.
> Compliance with existing MAC ARS requirements to conduct vulnerability
> scans and penetration testing is still mandatory.
>
> Briefly, architectural, security, data interchange and privacy
> requirements include the following:

1.  Architecture:

    -   Explicit compliance with CMS system lifecycle standards,
        particularly the CMS Technical Reference Architecture (TRA), as
        currently released, and all its appendices.

# Introduction

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> CMS business partners are required by the MAC ARS Contingency Planning
> family to develop and maintain a ITSCP. Business partners are expected
> to develop and test contingency plans that address key recovery
> scenarios that could occur as the result of a disastrous situation.
> While a contingency plan cannot address all possible scenarios, the
> plan should be structured to be useful in a variety of situations.
> When developing an ITSCP, the business partners are required to
> address all of the MAC ARS controls. The ITSCP needs to be developed
> in accordance with the CMS RMH Chapter 6 Contingency Planning
> document. In addition, NIST Special Publication 800-34 rev 1,
> Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems, should be
> reviewed. NIST identifies different components and plan types that
> should be documented and be incorporated in a robust ITSCP.
>
> The purpose of this appendix is to supplement the CMS RMH manual and
> NIST publication and to provide information to aid the business
> partner in planning for and responding to an emergency or system
> disruption, and to recover from that emergency or disruption. It is to
> be used by the CMS Medicare business partner management, IT systems
> management and staff, and system security persons charged with
> preparing for continuing the operation of Medicare systems and
> developing an ITSCP, or updating an existing plan. In addition, the
> business partner's SSP and ISRA should be used as a checkpoint to
> determine if appropriate contingencies have been addressed in the
> ITSCP. Also, the ITSCP should be coordinated with the Incident
> Response activities to address the restoration and recovery activities
> associated with an incident.
>
> It can be noted that an ITSCP can be out of date shortly after it is
> created and updated. Automated tools exist to facilitate the
> development and maintenance of a plan. These tools can significantly
> help keep a plan current, but they may not address all of the areas
> required and they may not format the data in a manner that is
> consistent with CMS requirements. In these situations, the business
> partner will need to supplement the tools with additional information
> and cross references to ensure that all required information is
> documented.

# Definition of an Acceptable ITSCP

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> An ITSCP is a document that describes how to deal with an emergency or

1.  Considers the protection of human life as the paramount guiding

2.  The backup, recovery, and restoration of critical business
    > functions, protecting equipment and data, and preserving the
    > business reputation for providing high-quality service.

3.  Is logical, reasonable, understandable, user friendly, and can be
    > implemented under adverse circumstances.

4.  Considers risk assessment results.

5.  Addresses possible and probable emergencies or system disruptions
    > that would require the implementation of the ITSCP.

6.  Can be sufficiently tested on an established regular basis within
    > recommended recovery periods at reasonable cost.

7.  Contains information that is needed and useful during an emergency
    > or system disruption.

8.  Can, when implemented, produce a response and recovery, such that
    > critical business functions are continued.

9.  Specifies the persons necessary to implement the plan, and clearly
    > defines their responsibilities.

10. Clearly defines the resources necessary to implement the plan.

11. Reflects what can be done -- is not a wish list.

12. Assumes people shall use sound judgment, but will need clearly
    > stated guidance, since they will be functioning in a non-normal
    > environment, under possibly severe conditions and pressure.

13. Addresses backup and alternate sites.

14. Addresses the use of manual operations, where appropriate and
    > necessary.

15. Contains definitive "Call Lists" to use for contacting the
    > appropriate persons in the proper sequence. These lists would
    > include vendor points of contact.

> An acceptable ITSCP should be concise. It should not contain any more
> information than is necessary to plan for and implement contingency
> actions. The users should not get bogged down in detail as they read
> the plan to determine what to do, when to do it, what is needed to do
> it, and who should do it. The ITSCP should serve as a "user's manual"
> and be easy to understand and use.
>
> Because an ITSCP is designed to be used in a stressful situation, it
> shall be written with that as a foremost thought in mind. The prime
> objective is to maximize the continuity of critical operations.
>
> Reviewing an ITSCP and testing it will help determine whether it
> remains an acceptable plan. The review and testing shall not focus
> solely on content, but shall also focus on ease of use.
>
> Careful thought should be given to the organization of the ITSCP. The
> organization should be logical in terms of what will the user want to

# IT Systems Contingency Planning

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> The goal of IT systems contingency planning is to continue
> accomplishing critical IT systems operations in an emergency or system
> disruption and to accomplish a rapid and smooth recovery process.

## Contingency Planning

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> Contingency planning is preparing for actions in the event of an
> emergency situation, and giving some thought and planning to what your
> organization will do to respond and recover. The IT systems
> contingency planning process shall address all the actions and
> resources needed to ensure continuity of operation of critical IT
> systems and the means of implementing the
>
> needed resources. IT management and staff shall be trained to handle
> emergency or system disruption situations in data centers and other
> areas where data processing systems are located. Contingency planning
> includes such training.
>
> It is advisable to establish an IT systems contingency planning team.
> This team would be responsible for defining critical IT systems,
> including applications software, data, processing and communications
> capabilities, and other supporting resources. These would be the key
> people in the implementation of the plan.

## Coordination with Other Business Partners

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> If a business partner's data center or other data processing
> environment is linked to other business partners for the transmission
> of Medicare data, then the contingency planning shall address those
> links relative to receiving input, exchanging files, and distributing
> output. If alternate/backup IT systems capabilities are to be
> utilized, then their functions and data transmission links shall be
> considered in the planning.
>
> Coordination with other business partners is essential to completing
> the IT systems contingency planning process.

## IT Systems Contingency Plan

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> The following required content, in conjunction with the format
> contained in the CMS RMH may be used in developing an IT Systems CP.
>
> The following checklist provides a means for determining if a CP
> contains the appropriate information that can readily be used in
> handling an emergency or system disruption. This list is not
> all-inclusive, but rather should serve as a thought stimulus for
> evaluating CPs.
>
> This checklist uses the same outline as the suggested CP format.

        > with no 'gray areas'?

    -   Will all who have a task to perform be aware of what is expected
        > of them?

    -   Does the CP assign responsibilities for recovery? The
        > responsibilities of key management and staff persons shall be
        > carefully described in the CP, so that there is no question
        > relative to the duties of these people during an emergency.

7.  Definition of Critical Functions

    -   Does the CP address critical systems and processes?

    -   Have emergency processing priorities been established and
        > approved by management?

    -   Does the CP specify critical data? The CP shall specify the
        > critical data needed to continue critical business functions
        > and how frequently the data is backed up.

    -   Has a list of critical operations, data, and applications been
        > created? In preparing the CP, a list of current critical
        > operations, data and applications shall be documented and

> approved by management. This list shall contain the items needed to
> continue the minimum critical business elements and functions until
> operations could be returned to a normal mode.

8.  Alternate Capabilities and Backup

    -   Have arrangements been made for alternate data processing and
        telecommunications facilities? Part of contingency planning
        includes the completion of arrangements for alternate data
        processing facilities and capabilities, and for alternate
        telecommunications capabilities necessary to re-establish
        critical interfaces.

    -   Does the CP address issues relative to pre-planned alternate
        locations? The CP shall address any potential issues relative to
        pre-planned alternate locations. These include:

        -   insurance

        -   equipment replacement

        -   phones

        -   utilities

        -   security

    -   Does contingency backup planning exist? Planning for appropriate
        backup of data and processing capabilities shall include:

        -   prioritizing operations

        -   identifying key personnel and how to reach them

        -   listing backup systems and where they are located

        -   stocking critical forms, blank check stock, and supplies
            > off-site

        -   developing reliable sources for replacing equipment on an
            > emergency basis

    -   Is there an alternate information processing site; if so, is
        there a contract or interagency agreement in place?

    -   Are the levels of equipment, materials and manpower sufficient
        to deal with the anticipated emergency? If not, have back-up
        resources been identified and, where necessary, have agreements
        for obtaining their use been established?

    -   Have temporary data storage sites and location of stored backups
        been identified?

    -   Is the frequency of file backup documented?

    -   Have the arrangements been made for ensuring continuing
        communications capabilities?

    -   Are backup files created on a prescribed basis and rotated
        off-site often enough to avoid disruption if current files are
        damaged?

    -   Are system, application, and other key documentation maintained
        at the off-site location?

    -   Are the backup storage and alternate sites geographically
        removed from the primary site and physically protected?

    -   Do data and program backup procedures exist? In order to be
        > prepared for an emergency, it is advisable to provide backups
        > of critical data and software programs.

> These are stored at off-site locations sufficiently distant from the
> primary site so as not to be affected by the same emergency that would
> affect the primary site.

-   Is the CP stored off-site at alternate/backup locations? Copies of
    > the CP shall be stored at several off-site locations, including
    > key personnel homes, so that at least one copy is readily
    > available in time of emergency. Copies of the CP that are stored
    > in a private home shall be protected from inadvertent access.

9.  Required Resources

    -   Are the following resources for supporting critical operations
        > defined and available for an emergency?

        -   People

        -   Supplies

        -   Basic essentials (water, food, shelter, transportation,
            > etc.)

    -   Does the CP provide for backup personnel? As the CP is
        > implemented, it is necessary to have additional people
        > available to support recovery operations. The CP shall specify
        > who these people are and when they would normally be called
        > into action.

10. Training

    -   Are management and staff trained to respond to emergencies?
        > Security training shall include modules for management and
        > staff relative to their roles for handling emergency
        > situations.

11. Testing the CP

    -   Is there a section in the CP that addresses testing of the plan?

12. CP Maintenance

    -   Schedule

        -   Is the CP annually reviewed and tested within every 365
            > days? The CP shall be reviewed and tested under conditions
            > as close to an emergency as can be reasonably and
            > economically simulated.

            > days?

        -   Is the CP revised after testing, depending on test results?
            > Are lessons learned documented and incorporated into the
            > revise CP?

13. Relationships/Interfaces

    -   Does the CP identify critical interfaces? Interfaces required to
        > continue critical business functions should be identified.
        > Refer to the System Security Plans.

    -   Which outside (vendors, providers, banks, utilities, services,
        > CMS) interfaces must be considered?

    -   Is the plan compatible with plans of interacting organizations
        > and systems?

    -   What internal interfaces must be considered?

    -   Which corporate interfaces must be considered?

    -   Are there special interfaces with corporate systems that must be

## Testing

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> CMS requires testing of the CP annually under conditions that simulate
> an emergency or a disaster. A CP shall also be tested after a
> substantive system change that necessitates a revision to the CP.
>
> CMS requires that the critical IT systems shall be tested within every
> 365 days and the CP updated to accommodate any changes, including
> updated versions of software or critical data. Critical systems are
> those whose failure to function, for even a short time, could have a
> severe impact, or have a high potential for fraud, waste, or abuse.

## CMS Virtual Data Centers (VDC)

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> Some contractors with which CMS has direct contracts do not have their
> own data centers. If a business partner does not have its own data
> center, then it is the responsibility of the business partner to
> inform the subcontractor that operates the data center that they shall
> have a CP that addresses the requirements outlined in the Appendix.

## Multiple Contractors

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> The VDCs usually serve multiple contractors. Existing shared
> processing environments allow for multiple contractors to process
> claims at a data center. There are several data centers processing
> Part A and Part B claims for multiple Medicare contractors.
>
> It is important to test a CP with a data center that serves multiple
> contractors. This provides an opportunity for the business partner to
> validate that they can recover the connection with the VDCs to process
> claims.

## Test Types

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> CP test guidance suggests four types of testing:

-   Walkthrough/Tabletop Test

-   Checklists

-   Simulation/modeling

-   Live/Comprehensive Exercises These are defined below:

-   **Walkthrough/Tabletop Test**: A walkthrough test is accomplished by
    > going through a set of steps to accomplish a particular task or
    > action initiated because of a contingency event. The precursor to
    > a walkthrough test is that the steps are documented so that they

> can be logically followed. A "test team" might sit around a table and
> talk through each step and then walk through" the various steps, and
> then discuss expected outcomes and further actions to be taken. They
> may use a checklist to ensure that all features of a step are
> addressed or that all resources necessary to accomplish the task or
> action are considered. A walkthrough test does not involve
> accomplishing the actions being tested in real time or using the live
> environment. A walkthrough test could be accomplished by using a group
> of test people to act out what might happen if a real contingency
> event occurred. They might go to the alternate site, but they would
> not actually start all hardware, software, and communication
> operations in order to assume the function of the primary site.
>
> For those applications that are both hosted at CMS [and
> not]{.underline} participating in a broader recovery test to a
> CMS-approved recovery site during their annual test cycle, a tabletop
> test is required. A tabletop test is discussion-based only, and does
> not involve deploying equipment or other resources. The discussion
> during the test can be based on a single scenario or multiple
> scenarios. By simulating an emergency in an informal, stress- free
> environment, this test method allows for the free exchange of ideas
> and provides participants an opportunity to practice the steps to be
> followed in an actual event and to identify areas in the CP for
> enhancement.
>
> A successful tabletop test steps participants through real-life
> scenarios; captures its results in a formal report; and incorporates
> the "lessons learned" into subsequent versions of the CP and the
> tabletop test plan.

-   **Checklists**: Checklists are used to clearly present a
    > step-by-step logical sequence so systems and sub-systems may be
    > recovered in a logical manner. Checklists are intended to provide
    > a direct, simple coordinated listing of events that ensure that
    > all necessary steps are executed during the recovery process.

-   **Simulation/Modeling**: Modeling involves creating a computer model
    > of the process to be tested. This allows easy testing of many
    > variables without physically having to make changes. For example,
    > you can vary the number of servers that go down during a disaster
    > or the number of people that can get to an alternate site
    > following a disaster.

> Simulation involves taking physical actions, but not necessarily to
> the full extent of what might actually happen during an emergency. For
> example, instead of actually moving everyone to an alternate site to
> continue operations, a small team may undertake a set of realistic
> preparatory actions at the prime site, and another team does the same
> at the alternate site. Thus, many steps could be simulated by the two
> teams and worthwhile results evaluated.

-   **Live/Comprehensive Exercises**: This is the most complete and
    > expensive test to accomplish. It involves completing the physical
    > steps that would actually be taken if an emergency occurred.
    > People and materials would be moved to an alternate site for the
    > test, and servers would actually be shut down to reduce
    > capability. Power would be shut off, and live conditions would be
    > tested. A live test uses actual environments, people, and
    > components to accomplish the test in real time. It is the real
    > thing, nothing artificial, or made up, is substituted. If the test
    > is to see if an alternate site capability can be implemented, then
    > in a live test, the hardware, software, data, communications, and
    > people at the alternate site would be set into action and begin
    > functioning as the primary site to support operations.

> End-to-end refers to the scope of the testing (partial testing is less
> than end-to-end). When conducting end-to-end testing, items to
> consider include:

-   End-to-end testing can be completed as part of walkthrough or live
    > test.

-   Not testing end-to-end means that some links, processes, or
    > subsystems are missed.

-   What is the risk in not conducting end-to-end testing?

-   Live end-to-end testing can be very expensive!

> Considering risks and cost, management shall make a decision as to
> what type and scope of testing is appropriate.

## Live vs. Walkthrough

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

-   High-level testing can take the form of a walkthrough test.

-   A walkthrough can be part of the overall testing process, but not
    > the whole process.

-   Lower-level testing can include a walkthrough, if live testing is
    > not an option.

    -   Live testing shall be the first choice.

    -   Fall back to a simulation/model if live testing is not an
        > option.

> Cost, time, and interruption of normal operations are major
> considerations in doing a live test.

-   A walkthrough test should be the last resort.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Consider what a walkthrough test would miss.

-   Consider the risks of missing that part of the test.

-   Remember that there is risk in not doing a live test---is the risk
    > acceptable?

    -   Consider the criticality of functions, processes, and systems.

> If critical to continuing essential business operations, then these
> are strong candidates for live testing.

-   Testing interfaces.

> It is important to test the critical interfaces with internal and
> external systems. It is difficult to test interfaces using a
> "walkthrough" method. Simulation or "live" testing is preferred.

-   Cost and complexity.

> The decision as to how to test critical functions, processes, and
> systems must result from careful consideration of complexity and cost.
> A complete "live" test of all elements of an operation may prove to be
> extremely costly, in terms of both dollars and time. If that cost
> outweighs the "cost" of the risk of not doing live testing, then
> "live" testing should probably be ruled out.

## End-to-End

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> This kind of testing aims to ensure that all software and hardware
> components associated with a function, process, or system are tested
> from the front end through to the back end (input through process
> through output). As with live testing, end-to-end testing can be
> expensive.

-   End-to-end testing shall only be considered for critical functions,
    > processes, or systems.

-   End-to-end testing provides the best assurance that there are no
    > problems.

-   If the overall process to be tested can be sub-divided into critical
    > and non-critical components, then only the critical components
    > need be considered for end-to-end testing.

-   Examples of types of end-to-end tests:

    -   Claims receipt through to check generation

    -   Query of a database through to the response

    -   Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) check request through to check
        > issue and back to MSP

-   The decision on how to test critical functions, processes, and
    > systems shall carefully consider complexity and cost. A complete
    > end-to-end test of all elements of an operation may prove to be
    > extremely costly, both in terms of dollars and time. If that cost
    > outweighs the cost of the risk of not doing end-to-end testing,
    > then end-to-end testing should probably be ruled out.

-   Look at the criticality of functions, processes, and systems. If
    > these are critical to continuing essential business operations,
    > then these are strong candidates for end-to-end testing.

-   If you cannot do end-to-end testing, then consider live testing of
    > all possible connections to help ensure minimum problems.

    -   Or, do simulation/modeling

    -   Or, do walkthrough

> Overall, end-to-end testing may combine walkthroughs,
> simulation/modeling, and live testing of contingencies. Walkthroughs
> and simulations may be used for non-critical systems, whereas critical
> systems shall be functionally tested under conditions that reproduce
> an emergency or a disaster.
>
> It is advisable that the testing of critical systems be done
> end-to-end, input through output, so that no physical activity,
> automated process, or Medicare business partner system is left
> untested. Critical interfaces internal and external to the systems
> shall be tested.

## Test Planning

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> An ITSCP test plan shall address at least the following:

-   Test objectives

-   Test approach

-   Required equipment and resources

-   Necessary personnel

-   Schedules and locations

-   Test procedures

-   Test results

-   Failed tests

-   After Action Report

-   Retest

-   Approvals

> It is advisable to establish test teams responsible for preparing and
> executing the ITSCP tests. Responsibilities shall be assigned to test
> team members, including executives, observers, and contractors.
>
> Following testing, any corrections specified in an After Action Report
> shall be included in the next ITSCP test. The process shall include:

-   List of items that failed the previous test

-   Corrections planned

-   Retest detail

-   Schedule

-   Review responsibilities

> Ensure that the lessons learned from ITSCP testing are formally
> discussed among senior business partner management, operations, IT
> management and staff, and the SSO.
>
> Documentation shall exist for:

-   Test plans

-   Test results

-   After Action Report

-   Retest plans

-   Memos of Understanding/Formal Test Arrangements

-   []{#_bookmark71 .anchor}Lessons Learned

## Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> MTD is the time it takes to recover an operation, function, process,
> program, file, or whatever has to be recovered as an operational
> entity. If claims processing operations must be recovered within 72
> hours, then that is the MTD to recover. Anything over that is
> unacceptable.

-   Recovery times may vary, depending on the criticality of the
    function involved.

-   Times can be from a few minutes to days or weeks.

-   A table/matrix can be constructed that lists the recovery times.

-   There can be a separate table/matrix for each major function (e.g.,
    claims processing, medical review, check generation).

-   Recovery times shall be clearly defined and must be achievable.

## Responsibilities

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

## Safeguards against Employee Fraud

### *(Rev. 11570; Issued: 08-19-22; Effective: 03-07-22; Implementation:04-03-23)*

> The following safeguards are specific countermeasures against
> fraudulent acts by employees whose functions involve Medicare program
> funds. These safeguards are consistent with the MAC ARS, and do not
> constitute wholly different or additional minimum requirements. The
> following countermeasures should prove especially effective against
> currently prevalent fraudulent activities and are discussed primarily
> as they relate to prevention and detection of fraud.

A.  Screen New Employees

> Screen new employees for positions that involve program funds directly
> or indirectly to address the applicant\'s past faithful and honest
> performance of duties with other employers in addition to job
> performance and investigation of his/her personal finances. New
> employees\' statements concerning personal finances shall be confirmed
> with former employers and with banking and credit institutions.
>
> Phone calls to previous employers are essential, particularly to
> former supervisors
>
> who should be advised of the nature of the position. Although former
> employers will sometimes fail to prosecute employees associated with
> fraudulent activities, they seldom delude a prospective employer
> asking about the applicant's integrity.
>
> Any blatant dishonesty in the application (such as claiming
> qualifications and experience the applicant never had) shall remove
> the applicant from further consideration. Check references and
> crosscheck them (one against the other) for consistency as well as
> content. Evaluate references on the basis of the contact\'s personal
> knowledge of the applicant\'s job-related qualifications and
> integrity.
>
> Proper screening is preventive medicine at its best. Gaps in
> employment are flags that call for third-party verification, not just
> a plausible explanation by the applicant. Former employers may be able
> to shed light on the situation or be able to relate the reason given
> them about gaps by the applicant.
>
> Circumstances relating to termination of previous employment should be
> clearly related by former employers. Resolve any inconsistencies or
> vagueness.
>
> Ask former employers as well as the applicant, whether the employee
> was ever bonded, or was ever refused bonding. Sensitive screening
> should not result in violating an applicant\'s civil rights, while
> assuring you (and your bonding company) that prudent concern is
> exercised in the hiring process.

B.  Bonding

> Bonding is also known as fidelity insurance and comes in all
> configurations; the broader the coverage, the more expensive the
> premium. One of the most important things you can do is analyze the
> extent and conditions of coverage in relation to possible
> misappropriations of funds. Liability is invariably limited in some
> respects. For example, coverage often does not extend to external
> fraud; to losses not proven to have been caused by fraudulent acts by
> covered employees; to frauds committed by employees known to have
> perpetrated dishonest acts previously; to frauds whose circumstances
> are not properly investigated; or to frauds whose alleged perpetrators
> are not brought to trial. Inherent in the analysis of bonding is risk
> analysis of fraud in relation to specific components to develop a
> worst-case fraud scenario in terms of dollar-loss before recovery
> through bonding.

C.  Separation of Duties

> Separate duties so that no one employee can defraud the company
> unaided. This is the cardinal rule for fraud prevention, one that is
> well-understood in manual operations. It is not as well understood in
> its application to computer processing where a single automated system
> may combine functions ordinarily separated, such as transactions and
> adjustments. Analyze all duties, including all stages of computer
> programming and operations, in terms of defeating single-handed fraud
> as well as in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, with fraud
> controls taking
>
> precedence. Group review of programmer code before allowing
> new/upgraded systems into production is the type of duty-separation
> (function vs. approval) that serves both effectiveness and security.

D.  Rotation of Duties

> Rotate duties, particularly those involving authorization of a
> transaction. Separation of duties makes it difficult for an employee
> to defraud your organization unaided, so that embezzlement becomes a
> crime of collusion. As more and more embezzlement involves more than
> one person, it becomes necessary to ensure that the same person is not
> always involved in approving another\'s functions. An employee is less
> likely to initiate a fraudulent transaction if he/she is not certain
> that his/her accomplice will be the one to approve or process that
> transaction. Moreover, the knowledge that from time to time other
> employees will perform his/her function or work his/her cases is a
> powerful deterrent to any fraudulent scheme, particularly embezzlement
> which requires continual cover-up.

E.  Manual Controls

> Manual controls are differentiated from automatic controls because
> constant review is necessary to see that they are in place and
> working. Moreover, they often supplement or augment automatic
> controls; for example, the manual review of claims rejected in
> computer processing. Review all manual controls to determine the
> extent to which they would be effective against fraud in any
> operational area; too often, controls are reviewed without fraud
> specifically in mind. Classic manual controls are those associated
> with the tape/disk library, and these controls are strongly associated
> with restricted access and separation of duties. It does little good
> to separate programmer/operator duties if the programmer is allowed to
> sign out production tapes or master files for any reason, especially
> live-testing. Library controls shall require specific authorization
> for tape removal for specific periods for specific reasons known to,
> and sanctioned by, the approving authority. The most important manual
> controls are those over blank-check stock and the automatic
> check-signer. The employee in control of the check-signer shall not at
> the same time control the check stock, although these duties may be
> rotated so that the person controlling the check-signer one day may be
> assigned to control check stock on the following day when a third
> person is responsible for the check-signer.
>
> However, no one individual shall be allowed to "sign" a check he/she
> has issued. Rotation of duties is proper only for subsequent
> operations where one\'s own previous actions have already cleared.

F.  Training

> Training employees in their responsibilities relative to fraud in
> their operations is basic to prudent management. This extends beyond
> the employee\'s own activities. For example, Title 18, U.S. Code
> Section 4 requires anyone having knowledge of a
>
> Federal crime to report it to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
> (FBI) or similar authority, with penalties of up to \$500 fine and 3
> years in jail for failure to do so. No employee should be ignorant of
> this responsibility. This responsibility can be explained as a simple
> good citizenship requirement and not spying or snitching. Discuss
> these things periodically in meetings, along with free give-and-take
> on moral issues and management\'s position on every aspect of fraud,
> including perpetration involving collusion with outsiders. Do not
> single out any employee or function in these discussions, instead make
> management\'s position clear regarding so-called "justification" for
> unauthorized "borrowing" and the fact that fraud can and will be
> prosecuted. Explain that there can be no permissive attitude towards
> dishonest acts because such an attitude is corrupting and makes it
> difficult for employees to remain honest. Make it known that there are
> controls throughout the organization to prevent and detect fraud,
> without being specific as to how they work. Require employees to
> report apparent loopholes in security that might one day (or already)
> be exploited for fraudulent purposes. Remind employees that ethical
> conduct requires their full cooperation in the event of any fraud
> investigation, and when interviewed they shall be called upon to
> explain why security gaps or suspicious activities were not reported
> to the SSO. No security program can be effective without the
> involvement and cooperation of employees, and nowhere is this truer
> than with fraudulent activity.

G.  Notices

> Notices, both periodic and situational, are effective and necessary in
> the prevention and control of fraud. It is not enough to formulate
> management policy or to conduct employee training relative to
> fraudulent activity. It is possible to remind employees of
> management\'s continuing concerns and to evaluate employee awareness
> through simple reminders or announcements of what is happening
> relative to fraud controls (of a general nature) and management\'s
> reliance on their cooperation and understanding of their
> responsibilities. Without this evidence of sustained management
> commitment, policy utterances tend to fade from memory or become
> regarded as part of a new employee\'s orientation and not part of the
> scene. This is true of minor abuses, but is also true of abuses that
> escalate into fraud.

H.  Automatic Controls

> Automatic controls to prevent or detect fraudulent activities comprise
> the first line of defense in computer operations. Such controls are
> often thought of as ensuring data integrity but more in terms of
> accuracy than of honesty. Evaluate automatic controls in terms of
> preventing payment to unauthorized persons. Test automatic controls
> with fraudulent (invalid) input, under strict control of courses, and
> with management\'s full cognizance and prior approval.

I.  Audit Routines

> Audit routines are those programs where trained auditors test for
> fraud using special routines to reveal computer processing that
> creates or diverts payments to employees or their accomplices.
> Wrongdoers not only have to create bogus payments, but also they have
> to be able to lay their hands on the checks in order to cash them.
> Devise audit routines to single-out payments being directed to post
> office boxes or to repeat addresses (where such repeats would be
> unreasonable), to the addresses of an employee or his family, or to a
> drop- off address that is not a real business but merely a place to
> collect mail.

## Checklist for Medicare Fraud

> (Rev. 10, Issued: 07-17-09, Effective: 08-17-09, Implementation:
> 08-17-09)
>
> This checklist represents questions to address in analyzing the
> security of Medicare fiscal operations.

1)  Have Medicare operations been identified where fraud or complicity
    > in fraud may be possible (e.g., initiation/approval of payments)?

2)  Have individuals been assigned fraud-protection responsibilities in
    > such components, including the responsibility for reporting
    > possible fraud and vulnerability to fraud?

3)  Do individual employees at all levels understand that management
    > policy relative to fraud is dismissal and prosecution?

4)  Are fiscal operations regularly audited relative to fraud
    > vulnerability?

5)  Are fraudulent acts specifically mentioned in the employee\'s code
    > of ethical conduct?

6)  Is employee integrity specifically addressed during the hiring
    > process, and do background investigations elicit information that
    > would uncover an applicant\'s past fraudulent activity with other
    > employers?

7)  Are operations set up in such a way as to discourage both individual
    > and collusive fraudulent activity?

8)  Are programs/systems tested by authorized individuals with
    > "fraudulent" input?

9)  Are audit trails generated that identify employees who create inputs
    > or make adjustments/corrections that would pinpoint responsibility
    > for any fraudulent act?

10) Is there an effective mechanism for detection/prevention of payments
    > being

> purposely misdirected to employees, relatives, or accomplices?

11) Are new or changed programs specifically reviewed for fraudulent
    > code by those responsible for production-run approval (persons
    > empowered to review changes but not to make changes themselves)?

12) Are controls designed to prevent fraud, especially in those
    > operations where large sums could be embezzled quickly?

13) Are all error-conditions checked for fraud potential?

14) Are balancing operations done creatively so that an embezzler could
    > not hide discrepancies?

15) Are the official activities of all employees, at all levels, subject
    > to independent review by different reviewers (i.e., not always by
    > the same evaluator)?

16) Does management insist on integrity at all levels?

17) Has management announced that employee\'s work activities will be
    > reviewed (in unspecified ways) for both the fact and appearance of
    > integrity?

18) Do tape/disk library controls in fact prevent tampering with
    > files/programs for fraudulent purposes?

19) Are alternative fraud controls invoked during emergencies?

20) Are suspected frauds investigated promptly and properly and are they
    > thoroughly documented?

21) Are fraud audits conducted both periodically and randomly?

22) Are random samples taken of claims/bill inputs and checked back to
    > their sources?

23) Does the Personnel Department check the applicant\'s background,
    > employment record, references, and possible criminal record before
    > hiring?

24) Are badges, identification cards/numbers, and passwords promptly
    > issued and rescinded?

25) Is off-hours work supervised, monitored, or otherwise effectively
    > controlled?

26) Are all employees required to take their vacations and are their
    > replacements required to check over the vacationers\' past
    > activities?

27) Are the credentials of outsiders, such as consultants and auditors,
    > checked out?

28) Is temporary help bonded, hired from reputable agencies, and their
    > activities restricted to the tasks to be performed? (Same
    > principle applies to employees temporarily borrowed from
    > non-Medicare components.)

29) Are written procedures controlled and restricted to employees
    > currently assigned the relevant duties?

30) Are special fraud controls specified for backup operations?

31) Are incoming checks, including returned checks, handled by two or
    > more individuals in the mailroom and are such teams switched
    > around so that the same people are not always working together?

32) Are blank checks and automatic check-signing equipment strictly
    > controlled with a tamper-proof numbering mechanism?

33) Is procedure/program documentation relative to the payment process
    > treated as highly sensitive data and safeguarded when superseded?

34) Are backup files current and securely stored off-site?

35) Are re-runs checked for the possibility of fraud, especially
    > duplicate payments?
