# - Delayed/Lapsed Certification and Recertification

### *(Rev. 253, Issued: 12- 14-18, Effective: 01-16-19, Implementation: 01- 16-19)*

> IPFs are expected to obtain timely certifications and
> recertifications. However, delayed certifications and recertifications
> will be honored where, for instance, there *has* been an oversight or
> lapse, and a legitimate reason for the delay as noted in Pub. 100-01,
> *chapter 4, ยง10.9.1 and ยง*20.1. Denial of payment for lack of the
> required certification and recertification is considered a technical
> denial, which means a statutory requirement has not been met.
> Consequently, if an appropriate certification is later produced, the
> denial shall be overturned. Reopenings of technical denial decisions
> may be initiated by the contractor or the provider.
>
> In addition to compliance with the appropriate certification and
> recertification content requirements, delayed certification and
> recertification must include an explanation for the delay and any
> medical or other evidence which the IPF considers relevant for
> purposes of explaining the delay. The IPF will determine the format of
> the delayed certifications and recertifications, and the method by
> which they are obtained. A delayed certification may be included with
> one or more recertifications on a single signed document. Separate
> signed documents for each delayed certification and recertification
> are not required as they would be if timely certification and
> recertification had been completed. For all IPF services, a delayed
> certification may not extend past discharge. IPF certification or
> recertification documentation may only be signed by a physician.

# - [Principles for Evaluating a Period of Active Treatment](#development-of-assessmentdiagnostic-data)

## (Rev. 59, Issued: 11-09-06, Effective: 01-01-05, Implementation: 12-04-06)

> In the context of IPF services, emphasis is placed on the presence of
> active treatment and, therefore, this determination is the crucial
> one. Simply applying the skilled care definition for general hospitals
> is not sufficient for determining whether payment may be
>
> made since that definition does not take into account the patient\'s
> potential for improvement nor was it designed to permit the more
> sophisticated judgments required by the concept of active treatment.
> For services in an IPF to be designated as active treatment, they must
> be:

-   Provided under an individualized treatment or diagnostic plan;

-   Reasonably expected to improve the patient\'s condition or for the
    > purpose of diagnosis; and

-   Supervised and evaluated by a physician.

> Such factors as diagnosis, length of hospitalization, and the degree
> of functional limitation, while useful as general indicators of the
> kind of care most likely being furnished in a given situation, are not
> controlling in deciding whether the care was active treatment. Refer
> to [[42 CFR
> 482.61]{.underline}](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=312b8476136e6013e567472e486b63e8&mc=true&node=se42.5.482_161&rgn=div8),
> Conditions of Participation for Hospitals, for a full description of
> what constitutes active treatment.
>
> The period of time covered by the physician\'s certification is
> referred to as a period of active treatment. This period should
> include all days on which inpatient psychiatric facility services were
> provided because of the individual\'s need for active treatment (not
> just the days on which specific therapeutic or diagnostic services are
> rendered). For example, a patient\'s program of treatment may
> necessitate the discontinuance of therapy for a period of time or it
> may include a period of observation, either in preparation for or as a
> follow-up to therapy, while only maintenance or protective services
> are furnished. If such periods were essential to the overall treatment
> plan, they would be regarded as part of the period of active
> treatment.
>
> The fact that a patient is under the supervision of a physician does
> not necessarily mean the patient is getting active treatment. For
> example, medical supervision of a patient may be necessary to assure
> the early detection of significant changes in his/her condition;
> however, in the absence of a specific program of therapy designed to
> effect improvement, a finding that the patient is receiving active
> treatment would be precluded.
>
> The program\'s definition of active treatment does not automatically
> exclude from coverage services rendered to patients who have
> conditions that ordinarily result in progressive physical and/or
> mental deterioration. Although patients with such diagnosis will most
> commonly be receiving custodial care, they may also receive services
> that meet the program\'s definition of active treatment (e.g., where a
> patient with Alzheimer\'s disease or Pick\'s disease received services
> designed to alleviate the effects of paralysis, epileptic seizures, or
> some other neurological symptom, or where a patient in the terminal
> stages of any disease received life-supportive care). A period of
> hospitalization during which services of this kind were furnished
> would be regarded as a period of active treatment.

# - Services Supervised and Evaluated by a Physician

## (Rev. 59, Issued: 11-09-06, Effective: 01-01-05, Implementation: 12-04-06)

> The types of services which meet the above requirements would include
> not only psychotherapy, drug therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy,
> but also such therapeutic activities as occupational therapy,
> recreational therapy, and milieu therapy, provided the therapeutic
> activities are expected to result in improvement in the patient\'s
> condition. If the only activities prescribed for the patient are
> primarily diversional in nature, (i.e., to provide some social or
> recreational outlet for the patient), it would not be regarded as
> treatment to improve the patient\'s condition. In many large hospitals
> these adjunctive services are present and part of the life experience
> of every patient. In a case where milieu therapy, (or one of the other
> therapeutic activities is involved), it is particularly important that
> this therapy be a planned program for the particular patient and not
> one where life in the hospital is designated as milieu therapy.
>
> In addition, the administration of antidepressant or tranquilizing
> drugs that are expected to significantly alleviate a patient\'s
> psychotic or neurotic symptoms would be termed active treatment
> (assuming that the other elements of the definitions are met).
> However, the administration of a drug or drugs does not necessarily
> constitute active treatment.
>
> Physician participation in the services is an essential ingredient of
> active treatment. The services of qualified individuals other than
> physicians, e.g., social workers, occupational therapists, group
> therapists, attendants, etc., must be prescribed and directed by a
> physician to meet the specific psychiatric needs of the individual. In
> short, the physician must serve as a source of information and
> guidance for all members of the therapeutic team who work directly
> with the patient in various roles. It is the responsibility of the
> physician to periodically evaluate the therapeutic program and
> determine the extent to which treatment goals are being realized and
> whether changes in direction or emphasis are needed. Such evaluation
> should be made on the basis of periodic consultations and conferences
> with therapists, reviews of the patient\'s medical record, and
> regularly scheduled patient interviews, at least once per week.
>
> When the physician periodically evaluates the therapeutic program to
> determine the extent to which treatment goals are being realized and
> whether changes in direction or emphasis are needed (based on
> consultations and conferences with therapists, review of the
> patient\'s progress as recorded on the medical record and the
> physician\'s periodic conversations with the patient), active
> treatment would be indicated. A finding that a patient is not
> receiving active treatment will not in itself preclude payment for
> physicians\' services under Medicare Part B. As long as the
> professional services rendered by the physician are reasonable and
> necessary for the care of the patient, such services would be
> reimbursable under the medical insurance program.
