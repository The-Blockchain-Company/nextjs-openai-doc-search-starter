# - Inpatient Psychiatric Benefit Days Reduction

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) A3-3104, HO-217

> If an individual is in a participating psychiatric hospital on the
> first day of the entitlement to hospital insurance, the number of
> inpatient benefit days in the first benefit period is subject to
> reduction. The days (not necessarily consecutive) on which an
> individual was an inpatient of a psychiatric hospital in the 150-day
> period immediately before the first day of entitlement must be
> subtracted from the 150 days of inpatient hospital services for which
> he/she would otherwise be eligible in the first benefit period. Days
> spent in a general hospital for diagnosis or treatment of a
> psychiatric condition prior to entitlement will not reduce the
> patient\'s 150 inpatient benefit days in the initial benefit period.
>
> After entitlement, the reduction applies not only to inpatient
> hospital services received in a psychiatric hospital, but also to
> services received in a general hospital if the individual is an
> inpatient of the general hospital primarily for the diagnosis or
> treatment of mental illness. If a patient has no psychiatric benefit
> days remaining because of the reduction, Medicare payment may still be
> made for up to 150 days of inpatient hospital services that are not
> for the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness.

### EXAMPLE l:

> John was admitted to a Medicare participating psychiatric hospital
> named Spring Psychiatric Hospital on January 20. John's Medicare
> entitlement was effective February 1 while John was still an inpatient
> of Spring Psychiatric Hospital. The 12 days of inpatient psychiatric
> care prior to entitlement are deducted from the 150 days available in
> the first benefit period. John has 138 days available in the first
> benefit period (150 minus 12 = 138).

## EXAMPLE 2:

> Mary was admitted to Spring Psychiatric Hospital on January 2 and
> discharged January
>
> 31\. She was readmitted March 1 and discharged April 15. Mary's
> Medicare entitlement became effective April 1. Mary used a total of 60
> psychiatric days in the 150 day period prior to her Medicare
> entitlement. Therefore, the days available to Mary in her first
> benefit period are 90 days. Pre-entitlement days used by Mary were 29
> for her January admission and 31 used during her March admission prior
> to her entitlement April 1.

# - Patient Status on Day of Entitlement

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) A3-3104.1, HO-217.1

> A patient in a participating psychiatric hospital on the first day of
> entitlement is subject to this reduction. The reduction applies to
> patients admitted to or discharged from such a hospital on their first
> day of entitlement, or who begin or end a leave of absence on that
> day. Where only a distinct part of an institution is participating as
> a psychiatric hospital,
>
> the provision applies only to patients who, on their first day of
> entitlement, are inpatients of that part.

# - Institution\'s Status in Determining Days Deducted

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) A3-3104.2, HO-217.2

> The status of a psychiatric hospital (or a distinct part of such a
> hospital) as of the individual\'s first day of entitlement is
> controlling in determining whether days spent there during the
> preceding 150 days are to be deducted. Thus, deductions would be made
> for days spent in a hospital (or distinct part) that was participating
> as of the individual\'s first day of entitlement even though it was
> not participating during all or part of the preceding 150 days.
> However, where an institution is not participating as of the
> individual\'s first day of entitlement, deductions would not be made
> for days spent in that institution during the preceding 150 days, even
> though the institution is later certified for participation as a
> psychiatric hospital.
>
> Where a participating psychiatric hospital is a distinct part of an
> institution, deductions are made only for days spent in the wards,
> floors, wings, etc., included in the participating distinct part as of
> the individual\'s first day of entitlement, even though it was not
> participating during all or part of the preceding 150 days. Deductions
> are not made for days spent in a part of the institution not included
> in the participating distinct part as of the individual\'s first day
> of entitlement, e.g., days spent in a custodial section of the
> institution or days spent in a general medical-surgical facility
> participating as a general hospital.

### EXAMPLE l:

> Alice was admitted to Spring Psychiatric Hospital, which is a
> participating hospital, on January 2 and discharged January 31. She
> was admitted to General Mental Health Hospital, which is not a
> Medicare participating hospital, on March 1 through March 30. On March
> 31, Alice was admitted to Spring Psychiatric Hospital. Alice's
> Medicare became effective April 1. The pre-entitlement days deducted
> from Mary's first benefit period are those used during her stay in
> Spring Psychiatric Hospital, which is a Medicare participating
> hospital. The pre-entitlement days used are 29 in January and 1 in
> March for a total of 30. Therefore, Alice has 120 days remaining in
> her first benefit period.

# 20 - Days of Admission, Discharge, and Leave

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 3, Duration of Covered
> Inpatient Services, for counting Medicare admission, discharge, and
> leave of absence days.

# 30 - Reduction for Psychiatric Services in General Hospitals

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) A3-3104.4, HO-217.4

> When an individual subject to a reduction in days is an inpatient in a
> general hospital the A/B MAC (A) will apply the reduction only if it
> has determined that the individual was an inpatient primarily for the
> diagnosis or treatment of mental illness.
>
> The A/B MAC (A) normally will make a decision based on the principle
> diagnosis shown on the claim. The reduction will not be applied where
> the principle diagnosis is not related to mental illness, even though
> other diagnoses may relate to mental illness.
>
> If the A/B MAC (A) needs more information than the principle diagnosis
> to make the required determination, it should obtain it from the
> hospital, the attending physician, or other appropriate source. Any
> case in which a reasonable question persists about whether the
> individual was an inpatient \"primarily for the diagnosis or treatment
> of mental illness\" should be resolved in favor of not applying the
> reduction.
>
> The term "mental illness" is defined as the specific psychiatric
> conditions described in the "American Psychiatric Association\'s
> Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - Mental Disorders."

# 40 - Determining Days Available

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

## A3-3104.5, HO-217.5, 42 CFR 409.63

> Since payment can be made only for the number of days remaining after
> the reduction is applied, the following steps should be taken to
> determine the number of days available in the first benefit period for
> which payment can be made for inpatient psychiatric hospital services
> and inpatient services in a general hospital for the treatment of
> mental illness:

1.  Determine how many days in the 150-day pre-entitlement period the
    patient spent in a psychiatric hospital;

2.  Subtract these from 150.

> Payment is made for the remaining days in the following order of
> priority:

1.  The 60 full benefit days;

2.  The 30 regular coinsurance days;

3.  The 60 lifetime reserve coinsurance days.

> Benefit days not available to the patient because of the psychiatric
> reduction (including lifetime reserve days) nevertheless, remain
> available for use in hospitalization not subject to the reduction;
> i.e., a general hospital stay for a nonpsychiatric condition. The
> lifetime days not previously used also remain available for any
> inpatient stays (including psychiatric hospital stays) in subsequent
> benefit periods.

### EXAMPLE l:

> The patient was an inpatient of a participating psychiatric hospital
> on his first day of entitlement. He had been in such a hospital in the
> pre-entitlement period for 20 days. Therefore, 130 days are payable.
> Payment would be made in the following order: 60 full benefit days, 30
> coinsurance (61st thru 90th) days, then 40 coinsurance (lifetime)
> days.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> During the 150-day period preceding Medicare entitlement, an
> individual had been a patient of a general hospital for 60 days of
> inpatient psychiatric care and had spent 90 days in a psychiatric
> hospital, ending with the first day of entitlement. During the initial
> benefit period, the beneficiary spent 90 days in a general hospital
> and received psychiatric care there. The 60 days spent in the general
> hospital for psychiatric treatment before entitlement does not reduce
> the benefits available in the first benefit period. Only the 90 days
> spent in the psychiatric hospital before entitlement reduce such
> benefits, leaving a total of 60 available psychiatric days. However,
> after entitlement, the reduction applies not only to days spent in a
> psychiatric hospital, but also to days of psychiatric treatment in a
> general hospital. Thus, Medicare payment could be made only for 60 of
> the 90 days spent in the general hospital.

## EXAMPLE 3:

> An individual was admitted to a general hospital for a mental
> condition and, after 10 days, transferred to a participating
> psychiatric hospital. The individual remained in the psychiatric
> hospital for 78 days before becoming entitled to hospital insurance
> benefits and for 130 days after entitlement. The beneficiary was then
> transferred to a general hospital and received treatment of a medical
> condition for 20 days. The 10 days spent in the general hospital
> during the 150-day preentitlement period have no effect on the
> inpatient hospital benefit days available to the individual for
> psychiatric care in the first benefit period, even though the general
> hospital stay was for a mental condition. Only the 78 days spent in
> the psychiatric hospital during the pre-entitlement period are
> subtracted from the 150 benefit days. Accordingly, the individual has
> 72 days of psychiatric care (150 days less 78 days) available in the
> first benefit period. Benefits could be paid for the individual\'s
> hospitalization during the first benefit period in the following
> manner. For the 130-day psychiatric hospital stay, 72 days (60 full
> benefit days and 12 coinsurance days), and for the general hospital
> stay, 20 days (18 coinsurance and 2 lifetime reserve days).

# 50 - Inpatient Psychiatric Hospital Services - Lifetime Limitation

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) A3-3105, HO-218

> Payment may not be made for more than a total of 190 days of inpatient
> psychiatric hospital services during the patient\'s lifetime. The
> limitation applies only to services
>
> furnished in a psychiatric hospital. The period spent in a psychiatric
> hospital prior to entitlement does not count against the patient\'s
> lifetime limitation, even though pre- entitlement days may have been
> counted against the 150 days of eligibility in the first benefit
> period.
>
> The CWF keeps track of days paid for inpatient psychiatric services
> and informs the A/B MAC (A) on claims where the 190-day limit is
> reached.
