# - Medical and Other Health Services Furnished to Inpatients of Participating Hospitals

## (Rev. 182, Issued: 03-21-14, Effective: 10-01-13, Implementation: 04-21-14)

> Payment may be made under Part B for physician services and for the
> nonphysician medical and other health services as provided in this
> section when furnished by a participating hospital (either directly or
> under arrangements) to an inpatient of the hospital, but only if
> payment for these services cannot be made under Part A. This policy
> applies to all hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs)
> participating in Medicare, including those paid under a prospective
> payment system or alternative payment methodology such as State cost
> control systems, and to emergency hospital services furnished by
> nonparticipating hospitals. In this section, the term "hospital"
> includes all hospitals and CAHs, regardless of payment methodology,
> unless otherwise specified.
>
> For services to be covered under Part A or Part B, a hospital must
> furnish nonphysician services to its inpatients directly or under
> arrangements (see chapter 16, §170 of this manual, "Inpatient Hospital
> or SNF Services Not Delivered Directly or Under Arrangement by the
> Provider"). A nonphysician service is one which does not meet the
> criteria defining physicians' services specifically provided for in
> regulation at 42 CFR
>
> 415.102. Services \"incident to\" physicians' services (except for the
> services of nurse anesthetists employed by anesthesiologists) are
> nonphysician services for purposes of this provision.

# - Reasonable and Necessary Part A Hospital Inpatient Claim Denials

## (Rev. 182, Issued: 03-21-14, Effective: 10-01-13, Implementation: 04-21-14)

> If a Medicare Part A claim for inpatient hospital services is denied
> because the inpatient admission was not reasonable and necessary, or
> if a hospital determines under 42 CFR
>
> §482.30(d) or §485.641 after a beneficiary is discharged that the
> beneficiary's inpatient admission was not reasonable and necessary,
> and if waiver of liability payment is not made, the hospital may be
> paid for the following Part B inpatient services that would have been
> reasonable and necessary if the beneficiary had been treated as a
> hospital outpatient rather than admitted as an inpatient, provided the
> beneficiary is enrolled in Medicare Part B:

1.  Part B services paid under the outpatient prospective payment system
    (OPPS), excluding observation services and hospital outpatient
    visits that require an outpatient status. Hospitals that are
    excluded from payment under the OPPS are instead paid under their
    alternative payment methodology (e.g., reasonable cost, all
    inclusive rate, or Maryland waiver) for the services that are
    otherwise payable under the OPPS.

2.  The following services excluded from OPPS payment, that are instead
    paid under the respective Part B fee schedules or prospectively
    determined rates for which payment is made for these services when
    provided to hospital outpatients:

    a.  Physical therapy services, speech-language pathology services,
        > and occupational therapy services (see chapter 15, §§220 and
        > 230 of this manual, "Covered Medical and Other Health
        > Services,").

    b.  Ambulance services.

    c.  Prosthetic devices, prosthetic supplies, and orthotic devices
        > paid under the DMEPOS fee schedule (excludes implantable
        > prosthetic devices (other than dental) which replace all or
        > part of an internal body organ (including colostomy bags and
        > supplies directly related to colostomy care) and replacement
        > of such devices).

    d.  Durable medical equipment supplied by the hospital for the
        > patient to take home, except durable medical equipment that is
        > implantable.

    e.  Certain clinical diagnostic laboratory services.

    f.  Screening and diagnostic mammography services.

    g.  Annual wellness visit providing personalized prevention plan
        > services.

> Hospitals may also be paid under Part B for services included in the
> payment window prior to the point of inpatient admission for
> outpatient services treated as inpatient services (see Pub. 100-04,
> Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 4, §10.12, "Payment Window
> for Outpatient Services Treated as Inpatient Services"), including
> services requiring an outpatient status. The hospital can only bill
> for services that it provided directly or under arrangement in
> accordance with Part B payment rules.
>
> Outpatient therapeutic services furnished at an entity that is wholly
> owned or wholly operated by the hospital and is not part of the
> hospital (such as a physician's office), may not be billed by the
> hospital to Part B. Reference labs may be billed only if the referring
> laboratory does not bill for the laboratory test (see Pub. 100-04,
> Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 16, §40.1, "Laboratories
> Billing for Referred Tests").
>
> The services billed to Part B must be reasonable and necessary and
> must meet all applicable Part B coverage and payment conditions.
> Claims for Part B services submitted following a reasonable and
> necessary Part A claim denial or hospital utilization review
> determination must be filed no later than the close of the period
> ending 12 months or 1 calendar year after the date of service (see
> Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 1, §70 "Time
> Limitations for Filing Part A and Part B Claims"). See Pub. 100-04,
> Medicare Claims Processing Manual, chapter 4, §240 for required bill
> types.

# - Other Circumstances in Which Payment Cannot Be Made Under Part A

## (Rev. 182, Issued: 03-21-14, Effective: 10-01-13, Implementation: 04-21-14)

> Part B payment could be made to a hospital for the medical and other
> health services listed in this section for inpatients enrolled in Part
> B if:

-   No Part A prospective payment is made at all for the hospital stay
    > because of patient exhaustion of benefit days before or during the
    > admission; or

-   The patient was not otherwise eligible for or entitled to coverage
    > under Part A (see chapter 16, §180 of this manual for services
    > received as a result of non- covered services).

> Beginning in 2014, for hospitals paid under the OPPS these Part B
> inpatient services are separately payable under Part B, and are
> excluded from OPPS packaging if the primary service with which the
> service would otherwise be bundled is not a payable Part B inpatient
> service.
>
> The following inpatient services are payable under the OPPS:

> fee schedules or prospectively determined rates listed:

-   Surgical dressings, and splints, casts, and other devices used for
    reduction of fractures and dislocations (DMEPOS fee schedule);

-   Prosthetic devices (other than dental) which replace all or part of
    an internal body organ (including colostomy bags and supplies
    directly related to colostomy care), including replacement of such
    devices and including one pair of conventional eyeglasses or contact
    lenses furnished subsequent to each cataract surgery with insertion
    of intraocular lens (DMEPOS fee schedule, except for implantable
    prosthetic devices paid at the applicable rate under Pub. 100-04,
    Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 4, §240.3, "Inpatient
    Part B Hospital Services - Implantable Prosthetic Devices");

# - Hospital Inpatient Services Paid Only Under Part B

## (Rev. 182, Issued: 03-21-14, Effective: 10-01-13, Implementation: 04-21-14)

> The services listed in Chapter 15, §250 of this manual, "Medical and
> Other Health Services Furnished to Inpatients of Hospitals and Skilled
> Nursing Facilities," when provided to a hospital inpatient, may be
> covered under Part B, even though the patient has Part A coverage for
> the hospital stay. This is because these services are covered under
> Part B and are not covered under Part A.
>
> In all hospitals, all other services provided to a hospital inpatient
> must be treated as an inpatient hospital service to be paid for under
> Part A, if Part A coverage is available and the beneficiary is
> entitled to Part A. This is because every hospital must provide
> directly or arrange for any nonphysician service rendered to its
> inpatients, and a hospital can be paid under Part B for a service
> provided in this manner only if Part A coverage does not exist.
>
> However, note that in order to have any Medicare coverage at all (Part
> A or Part B), any nonphysician service rendered to a hospital
> inpatient must be provided directly or arranged for by the hospital.

# - Outpatient Hospital Services

## (Rev. 157, Issued: 06-08-12, Effective: 07-01-12, Implementation: 07-02-12)

> Hospitals provide two distinct types of services to outpatients:
> services that are diagnostic in nature, and other services that aid
> the physician in the treatment of the patient. Part B covers both the
> diagnostic and the therapeutic services furnished by hospitals to
> outpatients. The rules in this section pertaining to the coverage of
> outpatient hospital services are not applicable to the following
> services.

-   Physical therapy, speech-language pathology or occupational therapy
    services when they are furnished "as therapy" meaning under a
    therapy plan of care. See chapter 15, sections 220 and 230 of this
    manual, for coverage and payment rules for these services, which are
    paid at the applicable amount under the physician fee schedule.

-   Services that are covered and paid under the End Stage Renal Disease
    Prospective Payment System. See Chapter 11, "End Stage Renal Disease
    (ESRD)" of this manual, for rules on the coverage of these services.

> For policies in addition to this section that apply to partial
> hospitalization services, see chapter 6, section 70.3 of this manual,
> and Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, chapter 4, section
> 260.
>
> For rules on the coverage of services and supplies furnished incident
> to a physician's professional services in an office or
> physician-directed clinic setting, refer to Chapter 15, "Covered
> Medical and Other Health Services," section 60 of this manual.

# - General Rule

## (Rev. 82; Issued: 02-08-08; Effective: 01-01-08; Implementation: 03-10-08)

> Except as provided in section 20.1.2 of this chapter, Medicare Part B
> does not pay for any item or service that is furnished to a hospital
> outpatient, as defined in section 20.2, during an encounter, as
> defined in section 20.3, by an entity other than the hospital unless
> the hospital has arrangements with that entity to furnish that
> particular service to its patients. The arrangements must provide that
> Medicare payment made to the hospital that arranged for the services
> discharges the liability of the beneficiary or any other person to pay
> for those services. See the Medicare General Information, Eligibility,
> and Entitlement Manual, Pub.100-01, chapter 5, section 10.3 for the
> definition of "arrangements." For the purposes of this section, the
> term "hospital" includes a Critical Access Hospital (CAH).

# - Exception to Limitation

## (Rev. 82; Issued: 02-08-08; Effective: 01-01-08; Implementation: 03-10-08)

> The limitation stated in section 20.1.1 does not apply to the
> following services:

-   Physicians' professional services that meet the following
    > conditions:

    -   The services are personally furnished for an individual
        > beneficiary by a physician;

    -   The services contribute directly to the diagnosis or treatment
        > of an individual beneficiary;

    -   The services ordinarily require performance by a physician;

    -   In the case of radiology or laboratory services, additional
        > requirements in 42 CFR §415.120 and §415.130, respectively of
        > the Code of Federal Regulations are met.

-   Physician assistant services, as defined in section 1861(s)(2)(K)(i)
    > of the Social Security Act (the Act);

-   Nurse practitioner and clinical nurse specialist services, as
    > defined in section 1861(s)(2)(K)(ii) of the Act;

-   Qualified psychologist services, as defined in section 1861(ii) of
    > the Act;

-   Services of an anesthetist, as defined in regulations in 42 CFR
    > 410.69;

-   Services furnished to SNF residents as defined in regulations in 42
    > CFR 411.15(p).

# - Outpatient Defined

## (Rev. 82; Issued: 02-08-08; Effective: 01-01-08; Implementation: 03-10-08)

> A hospital outpatient is a person who has not been admitted by the
> hospital as an inpatient but is registered on the hospital records as
> an outpatient and receives services (rather than supplies alone) from
> the hospital or CAH. Where a tissue sample, blood sample, or specimen
> is taken by personnel that are neither employed nor arranged for by
> the hospital and is sent to the hospital for performance of tests, the
> tests are not outpatient hospital services since the patient does not
> directly receive services from the hospital.
>
> See
> s[ection](#laboratory-services-furnished-to-nonhospital-patients-by-hospital-laboratory)
> 70.5 for coverage of laboratory services furnished to nonhospital
> patients by a hospital laboratory unless the patient is also a
> registered hospital outpatient receiving outpatient services from the
> hospital on the same day and the hospital is not a CAH or Maryland
> waiver hospital. Similarly, supplies provided by a hospital supply
> room for use by physicians in the treatment of private patients are
> not covered as an outpatient service since the patients receiving the
> supplies are not outpatients of the hospital. (See the Medicare
> Benefit Policy Manual, Pub. 100-02, Chapter 1,"Inpatient Hospital
> Services," section 10, for the definition of "inpatient.")
>
> Where the hospital uses the category \"day patient,\" i.e., an
> individual who receives hospital services during the day and is not
> expected to be lodged in the hospital at midnight, the individual is
> considered an outpatient. For information on outpatient observation
> status, refer to section 20.6 of this chapter and to the Medicare
> Claims Processing Manual, Pub.100-04, chapter 4, section 290,
> "Outpatient Observation Services." For information on conditions when
> an inpatient admission may be changed to outpatient status, refer to
> the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Pub.100-04, Chapter 1, "General
> Billing Requirements," section 50.3.
>
> The inpatient of a SNF may be considered the outpatient of a
> participating hospital. However, the inpatient of a participating
> hospital cannot be considered an outpatient of that or any other
> hospital.
>
> Outpatient hospital services furnished in the emergency room to a
> patient classified as "dead on arrival" are covered until
> pronouncement of death, if the hospital considers such
>
> patients as outpatients for record-keeping purposes and follows its
> usual outpatient billing practice for such services to all patients,
> both Medicare and non-Medicare. This coverage does not apply if the
> patient was pronounced dead prior to arrival at the hospital.

# - Encounter Defined

## (Rev. 101, Issued: 01-16-09, Effective: 01-01-09, Implementation: 01-05-09)

> **Source: 42 CFR 410.2 and 482.12**
>
> A hospital outpatient "encounter" is a direct personal contact between
> a patient and a physician, or other person who is authorized by State
> licensure law and, if applicable, by hospital or CAH staff bylaws, to
> order or furnish hospital services for diagnosis or treatment of the
> patient.
>
> The conditions of participation for hospitals under 42 CFR
> 482.12(c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(vi) require that every Medicare patient
> is under the care of a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, a doctor of
> dental surgery or dental medicine, a doctor of podiatric medicine, a
> doctor of optometry, a chiropractor, or a clinical psychologist; each
> practicing within the extent of the Act, the Code of Federal
> Regulations, and State law. Further, 42 CFR 482.12(c)(4) requires that
> a doctor of medicine or osteopathy must be responsible for the care of
> each Medicare patient with respect to any medical or psychiatric
> condition that is present on admission or develops during
> hospitalization and is not specifically within the scope of practice
> of one of the other practitioners listed in 42 CFR 482.12(c)(1)(i)

# - Outpatient Diagnostic Services

> **(Rev. 82; Issued: 02-08-08; Effective: 01-01-08; Implementation:

# - Diagnostic Services Defined

## (Rev. 82; Issued: 02-08-08; Effective: 01-01-08; Implementation: 03-10-08)

> A service is "diagnostic" if it is an examination or procedure to
> which the patient is subjected, or which is performed on materials
> derived from a hospital outpatient, to obtain information to aid in
> the assessment of a medical condition or the identification of a
> disease. Among these examinations and tests are diagnostic laboratory
> services such as hematology and chemistry, diagnostic x-rays, isotope
> studies, EKGs, pulmonary function studies, thyroid function tests,
> psychological tests, and other tests given to determine the nature and
> severity of an ailment or injury.

## (Rev. 128, Issued: 05-28-10, Effective: 07-01-10, Implementation: 07-06-10)

> Covered diagnostic services to outpatients include the services of
> nurses, psychologists, technicians, drugs and biologicals necessary
> for diagnostic study, and the use of supplies and equipment. When a
> hospital sends hospital personnel and hospital equipment to a
> patient's home to furnish a diagnostic service, Medicare covers the

>
> For services furnished before August 1, 2000, hospital personnel may

# - Outpatient Observation Services

## (Rev. 215, Issued, 12-18-15, Effective, 01-01-16, Implementation: 01-04-16)

A.  **Outpatient Observation Services Defined**

> Observation care is a well-defined set of specific, clinically
> appropriate services, which include ongoing short term treatment,
> assessment, and reassessment before a decision can be made regarding
> whether patients will require further treatment as hospital inpatients
> or if they are able to be discharged from the hospital. Observation
> services are commonly ordered for patients who present to the
> emergency department and who then require a
>
> significant period of treatment or monitoring in order to make a
> decision concerning their admission or discharge.
>
> Observation services are covered only when provided by the order of a
> physician or another individual authorized by state licensure law and
> hospital staff bylaws to admit patients to the hospital or to order
> outpatient tests. In the majority of cases, the decision whether to
> discharge a patient from the hospital following resolution of the
> reason for the observation care or to admit the patient as an
> inpatient can be made in less than 48 hours, usually in less than 24
> hours. In only rare and exceptional cases do reasonable and necessary
> outpatient observation services span more than 48 hours.
>
> Hospitals may bill for patients who are directly referred to the
> hospital for outpatient observation services. A direct referral occurs
> when a physician in the community refers a patient to the hospital for
> outpatient observation, bypassing the clinic or emergency department

## Coverage of Outpatient Observation Services

> When a physician orders that a patient receive observation care, the
> patient's status is that of an outpatient. The purpose of observation
> is to determine the need for further treatment or for inpatient
> admission. Thus, a patient receiving observation services may improve
> and be released, or be admitted as an inpatient (see Pub. 100-02,
> Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 1, Section 10 "Covered
> Inpatient Hospital Services Covered Under Part A" at
> [[https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/bp102c01.pdf)
> [[Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/bp102c01.pdf]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/bp102c01.pdf)).
> For more information on correct reporting of observation services, see
> Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, chapter 4, section
> 290.2.2.)
>
> All hospital observation services, regardless of the duration of the
> observation care, that are medically reasonable and necessary are
> covered by Medicare. Observation services are reported using HCPCS
> code G0378 (Hospital observation service, per hour). As of January 1,
> 2008, HCPCS code G0378 for hourly observation services is assigned
> status indicator N, signifying that its payment is always packaged. No
> separate payment is made for observation services reported with HCPCS
> code G0378. In most circumstances, observation services are supportive
> and ancillary to the other separately payable services provided to a
> patient. Beginning January 1, 2016, in certain circumstances when
> observation care is billed in conjunction with a clinic visit, Type A
> emergency department visit (Level 1 through 5), Type B emergency
> department visit (Level 1 through 5), critical care services, or
> direct referral for observation services as an
>
> []{#_bookmark21 .anchor}integral part of a patient's extended
> encounter of care, comprehensive payment may be made for all services
> on the claim including, the entire extended care encounter when
> certain criteria are met. For information about billing and payment
> methodology for observation services in years prior to CY 2008, see
> Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 4,
> §§290.3-290.4. For information about payment for extended assessment
> and management under composite APCs and comprehensive APCs, see
> §290.5.
>
> Payment for all reasonable and necessary observation services is
> packaged into the payments for other separately payable services
> provided to the patient in the same encounter. Observation services
> packaged through assignment of status indicator N are covered OPPS
> services. Since the payment for these services is included in the APC
> payment for other separately payable services on the claim, hospitals
> must not bill Medicare beneficiaries directly for the packaged
> services.

## Services Not Covered by Medicare and Notification to the Beneficiary

> In making the determination whether an ABN can be used to shift
> liability to a beneficiary for the cost of non-covered items or
> services related to an encounter that includes observation care, the
> provider should follow a two step process. First, the provider must
> decide whether the item or service meets either the definition of
> observation care or would be otherwise covered. If the item or service
> does not meet the definitional requirements of any Medicare-covered
> benefit under Part B, then the item or service is not covered by
> Medicare and an ABN is not required to shift the liability to the
> beneficiary. However, the provider may choose to provide voluntary
> notification for these items or services.
>
> Second, if the item or service meets the definition of observation
> services or would be otherwise covered, then the provider must decide
> whether the item or service is "reasonable and necessary" for the
> beneficiary on the occasion in question, or if the item or service
> exceeds any frequency limitation for the particular benefit or falls
> outside of a timeframe for receipt of a particular benefit. In these
> cases, the ABN would be used to shift the liability to the beneficiary
> (see Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual; Chapter 30,
> "Financial Liability Protections," Section 20, at
> [[https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/clm104c30.pdf)

> for information regarding Limitation On Liability (LOL) Under §1879
> Where Medicare Claims Are Disallowed).
>
> If an ABN is not issued to the beneficiary, the provider may be held
> liable for the cost of the item or service unless the
> provider/supplier is able to demonstrate that they did not know and
> could not have reasonably been expected to know that Medicare would
> not pay for the item or service.

# - Outpatient Hospital Psychiatric Services

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03) A3-3112.7, HO-230.5**

# - General

## (Rev. 10, 05-07-04)

> **A3-3112.7.A, HO-230.5.A**
>
> There is a wide range of services and programs that a hospital may
> provide to its outpatients who need psychiatric care, ranging from a
> few individual services to comprehensive, full-day programs; from
> intensive treatment programs to those that provide primarily
> supportive.
>
> In general, to be covered the services must be:

-   Incident to a physician's service (see
    > [[§20.4]{.underline}](#outpatient-diagnostic-services)); and

-   Reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the
    > patient's condition.

> This means the services must be for the purpose of diagnostic study or
> the services must reasonably be expected to improve the patient's
> condition.

## Coverage Criteria

> The services must meet the following criteria:

## Individualized Treatment Plan

> Services must be prescribed by a physician and provided under an
> individualized written plan of treatment established by a physician
> after any needed consultation with appropriate staff members. The plan
> must state the type, amount, frequency, and duration of the services
> to be furnished and indicate the diagnoses and anticipated goals. (A
> plan is not required if only a few brief services are furnished.)

## Physician Supervision and Evaluation

> Services must be supervised and periodically evaluated by a physician
> to determine the extent to which treatment goals are being realized.
> The evaluation must be based on periodic consultation and conference
> with therapists and staff, review of medical records, and patient
> interviews. Physician entries in medical records must support this
> involvement. The physician must also provide supervision and direction
> to any therapist involved in the patient\'s treatment and see the
> patient periodically to evaluate the course of treatment and to
> determine the extent to which treatment goals are being realized and
> whether changes in direction or emphasis are needed.

## Reasonable Expectation of Improvement

> Services must be for the purpose of diagnostic study or reasonably be
> expected to improve the patient\'s condition. The treatment must, at a
> minimum, be designed to reduce or control the patient\'s psychiatric
> symptoms so as to prevent relapse or hospitalization,
> [and]{.underline} improve or maintain the patient\'s level of
> functioning.
>
> It is not necessary that a course of therapy have as its goal
> restoration of the patient to the level of functioning exhibited prior
> to the onset of the illness, although this may be appropriate for some
> patients. For many other psychiatric patients, particularly those with
> long-term, chronic conditions, control of symptoms and maintenance of
> a functional level to avoid further deterioration or hospitalization
> is an acceptable expectation of improvement. \"Improvement\" in this
> context is measured by comparing the effect of continuing treatment
> versus discontinuing it. Where there is a reasonable expectation that
> if treatment services were withdrawn the patient\'s condition would
> deteriorate, relapse further, or require hospitalization, this
> criterion is met.
>
> Some patients may undergo a course of treatment that increases their
> level of functioning, but then reach a point where further significant
> increase is not expected. Such claims are not automatically considered
> noncovered because conditions have stabilized, or because
>
> treatment is now primarily for the purpose of maintaining present
> level of functioning. Rather, coverage depends on whether the criteria
> discussed above are met. Services are noncovered only where the
> evidence clearly establishes that the criteria are not met; for
> example, that stability can be maintained without further treatment or
> with less intensive treatment.

## Partial Hospitalization

> Partial hospitalization is a distinct and organized intensive
> treatment program for patients who would otherwise require inpatient
> psychiatric care. See [§70.3]{.underline} for specific program
> requirements.

## Application of Criteria

> The following discussion illustrates the application of the above
> guidelines to the more common modalities and procedures used in the
> treatment of psychiatric patients and some factors that are considered
> in determining whether the coverage criteria are met.

## Covered Services

> Services generally covered for the treatment of psychiatric patients
> are:

-   Individual and group therapy with physicians, psychologists, or
    > other mental health professionals authorized by the State.

-   Occupational therapy services are covered if they require the skills
    > of a qualified occupational therapist and be performed by or under
    > the supervision of a qualified occupational therapist or by an
    > occupational therapy assistant.

-   Services of social workers, trained psychiatric nurses, and other
    > staff trained to work with psychiatric patients.

-   Drugs and biologicals furnished to outpatients for therapeutic
    > purposes, but only if they are of a type which cannot be
    > self-administered.

-   Activity therapies but only those that are individualized and
    > essential for the treatment of the patient\'s condition. The
    > treatment plan must clearly justify the need for each particular
    > therapy utilized and explain how it fits into the patient\'s
    > treatment.

-   Family counseling services. Counseling services with members of the
    > household are covered only where the [primary]{.underline} purpose
    > of such counseling is the treatment of the patient\'s condition.

-   Patient education programs, but only where the educational
    > activities are closely related to the care and treatment of the
    > patient.

-   Diagnostic services for the purpose of diagnosing those individuals
    > for whom an extended or direct observation is necessary to
    > determine functioning and interactions, to identify problem areas,
    > and to formulate a treatment plan.

## Noncovered Services

> The following are generally not covered except as indicated:

-   Meals and transportation.

-   Activity therapies, group activities or other services and programs
    > which are primarily recreational or diversional in nature.
    > Outpatient psychiatric day treatment programs that consist
    > entirely of activity therapies are not covered.

> \"Geriatric day care\" programs are available in both medical and
> nonmedical settings. They provide social and recreational activities
> to older individuals who need some supervision during the day while
> other family members are away from home. Such programs are not covered
> since they are not considered reasonable and necessary for a diagnosed
> psychiatric disorder, nor do such programs routinely have physician
> involvement.

-   Psychosocial programs. These are generally community support groups
    > in nonmedical settings for chronically mentally ill persons for
    > the purpose of social interaction. Outpatient programs may include
    > some psychosocial components; and to the extent these components
    > are [not]{.underline} primarily for social or recreational
    > purposes, they are covered. However, if an individual\'s
    > outpatient hospital program consists entirely of psychosocial
    > activities, it is not covered.

-   Vocational training. While occupational therapy may include
    > vocational and prevocational assessment and training, when the
    > services are related [solely]{.underline} to specific employment
    > opportunities, work skills or work settings, they are not covered.

## Frequency and Duration of Services

> There are no specific limits on the length of time that services may
> be covered. There are many factors that affect the outcome of
> treatment; among them are the nature of the illness, prior history,
> the goals of treatment, and the patient\'s response. As long as the
> evidence shows that the patient continues to show improvement in
> accordance with his/her individualized treatment plan, and the
> frequency of services is within accepted norms of medical practice,
> coverage may be continued.
>
> If a patient reaches a point in his/her treatment where further
> improvement does not appear to be indicated, evaluate the case in
> terms of the criteria to determine whether with continued treatment
> there is a reasonable expectation of improvement.

# - Coverage Criteria for Outpatient Hospital Psychiatric Services

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> **A3-3112.7.B, HO-235.5.B**
>
> The services must meet the criteria outlined in the National Coverage
> Determinations Manual.

# - Partial Hospitalization Services

## (Rev. 194, Issued: 09-03-14, Effective: Upon Implementation of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> Partial hospitalization programs (PHPs) are structured to provide
> intensive psychiatric care through active treatment that utilizes a
> combination of the clinically recognized items and services described
> in [[§1861(ff)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Social Security Act (the Act). The treatment program of a PHP
> closely resembles that of a highly structured, short-term hospital
> inpatient program. It is treatment at a level more intense than
> outpatient day treatment or psychosocial rehabilitation. Programs
> providing primarily social, recreational, or diversionary activities
> are not considered partial hospitalization.

## Program Criteria

> PHPs work best as part of a community continuum of mental health
> services which range from the most restrictive inpatient hospital
> setting to less restrictive outpatient care and support. Program
> objectives should focus on ensuring important community ties and
> closely resemble the real-life experiences of the patients served.
> PHPs may be covered under Medicare when they are provided by a
> hospital outpatient department or a Medicare-certified CMHC.
>
> Partial hospitalization is active treatment that incorporates an
> individualized treatment plan which describes a coordination of
> services wrapped around the particular needs of the patient, and
> includes a multidisciplinary team approach to patient care under the
> direction of a physician. The program reflects a high degree of
> structure and scheduling. According to current practice guidelines,
> the treatment goals should be measurable, functional, time-framed,
> medically necessary, and directly related to the reason for admission.
>
> A program comprised primarily of diversionary activity, social, or
> recreational therapy does not constitute a PHP. Psychosocial programs
> which provide only a structured environment, socialization, and/or
> vocational rehabilitation are not covered by Medicare. A program that
> only monitors the management of medication for patients whose
> psychiatric condition is otherwise stable, is not the combination,
> structure, and intensity of services which make up active treatment in
> a PHP.

B.  ## Patient Eligibility Criteria

    1.  **Benefit Category**

> Patients must meet benefit requirements for receiving the partial
> hospitalization services as defined in §1861(ff) and §1835(a)(2)(F) of
> the Act. Patients admitted to a PHP must be under the care of a
> physician who certifies the need for partial hospitalization and
> require a minimum of 20 hours per week of therapeutic services, as
> evidenced by their plan of care. The patients also require a
> comprehensive, structured, multimodal treatment requiring medical
> supervision and coordination, provided under an individualized plan of
> care, because of a mental disorder which severely interferes with
> multiple areas of daily life, including social, vocational, and/or
> educational functioning. Such dysfunction generally is of an acute
> nature. In addition, PHP patients must be able to cognitively and
> emotionally participate in the active treatment process, and be
> capable of tolerating the intensity of a PHP program.
>
> Patients meeting benefit category requirements for Medicare coverage
> of a PHP comprise two groups: those patients who are discharged from
> an inpatient hospital treatment program, and the PHP is in lieu of
> continued inpatient treatment; or those patients who, in the absence
> of partial hospitalization, would be at reasonable risk of requiring
> inpatient hospitalization. Where partial hospitalization is used to
> shorten an inpatient stay and transition the patient to a less intense
> level of care, there must be evidence of the need for the acute,
> intense, structured combination of services provided by a PHP.
> Recertification must address the continuing serious nature of the
> patients' psychiatric condition requiring active treatment in a PHP.
>
> Discharge planning from a PHP may reflect the types of best practices
> recognized by professional and advocacy organizations that ensure
> coordination of needed services and follow-up care. These activities
> include linkages with community resources, supports, and providers in
> order to promote a patient's return to a higher level of functioning
> in the least restrictive environment.

## Covered Services

> Items and services that can be included as part of the structured,
> multimodal active treatment program, identified in §1861(ff)(2)
> include:

-   Individual or group psychotherapy with physicians, psychologists, or
    > other mental health professionals authorized or licensed by the
    > State in which they practice (e.g., licensed clinical social
    > workers, clinical nurse specialists, certified alcohol and drug
    > counselors);

-   Occupational therapy requiring the skills of a qualified
    > occupational therapist. Occupational therapy, if required, must be
    > a component of the physicians treatment plan for the individual;

-   Services of other staff (social workers, psychiatric nurses, and
    > others) trained to work with psychiatric patients;

-   Drugs and biologicals that cannot be self administered and are
    > furnished for therapeutic purposes (subject to limitations
    > specified in 42 CFR 410.29);

-   Individualized activity therapies that are not primarily
    > recreational or diversionary. These activities must be
    > individualized and essential for the treatment of the patient's
    > diagnosed condition and for progress toward treatment goals;

-   Family counseling services for which the primary purpose is the
    > treatment of the patient's condition;

-   Patient training and education, to the extent the training and
    > educational activities are closely and clearly related to the
    > individuals care and treatment of his/her diagnosed psychiatric
    > condition; and

-   Medically necessary diagnostic services related to mental health
    > treatment.

> Partial hospitalization services that make up a program of active
> treatment must be vigorous and proactive (as evidenced in the
> individual treatment plan and progress notes) as opposed to passive
> and custodial. It is not enough that a patient qualify under the
> benefit category requirements in or of §1835(a)(2)(F) unless he/she
> also has the need for the active treatment provided by the program of
> services defined in §1861(ff). It is the need for intensive, active
> treatment of his/her condition to maintain a functional level
> [and]{.underline} to prevent relapse or hospitalization, which
> qualifies the patient to receive the services identified in §1861(ff).

## Reasonable and Necessary Services

> This program of services provides for the diagnosis and active,
> intensive treatment of the individual's serious psychiatric condition
> and, in combination, are reasonably expected to improve or maintain
> the individual's condition and functional level and prevent relapse or
> hospitalization. A particular individual covered service (described
> above) as intervention, expected to maintain or improve the
> individual's condition and prevent relapse, may also be included
> within the plan of care, but the overall intent of the partial program
> admission is to treat the serious presenting psychiatric symptoms.
> Continued treatment in order to maintain a stable psychiatric
> condition or functional level requires evidence that less intensive
> treatment options (e.g., intensive outpatient, psychosocial, day
> treatment, and/or other community supports) cannot provide the level
> of support necessary to maintain the patient and to prevent
> hospitalization.
>
> Patients admitted to a PHP do not require 24 hour per day supervision
> as provided in an inpatient setting, must have an adequate support
> system to sustain/maintain themselves outside the PHP and must not be
> an imminent danger to themselves or others. Patients admitted to a PHP
> generally have an acute onset or decompensation of a covered Axis I
> mental disorder, as defined by the current edition of the Diagnostic
> and Statistical Manual
>
> published by the American Psychiatric Association or listed in Chapter
> 5, of the version of the International Classification of Diseases
> (ICD) applicable to the service date, which severely interferes with
> multiple areas of daily life. The degree of impairment will be severe
> enough to require a multidisciplinary intensive, structured program,
> but not so limiting that patients cannot benefit from participating in
> an active treatment program. It is the need, as certified by the
> treating physician, for the intensive, structured combination of
> services provided by the program that constitute active treatment,
> that are necessary to appropriately treat the patient's presenting
> psychiatric condition.
>
> For patients who do not meet this degree of severity of illness, and
> for whom partial hospitalization services are not necessary for the
> treatment of a psychiatric condition, professional services billed to
> Medicare Part B (e.g., services of psychiatrists and psychologists)
> may be medically necessary, even though partial hospitalization
> services are not.
>
> Patients in PHP may be discharged by either stepping up to an
> inpatient level of care which would be required for patients needing
> 24-hour supervision, or stepping down to a less intensive level of
> outpatient care when the patient's clinical condition improves or
> stabilizes and he/she no longer requires structured, intensive,
> multimodal treatment.

## Reasons for Denial

a.  Benefit category denials made under §1861(ff) or §1835(a)(2)(F) are
    not appealable by the provider and the limitation on liability
    provision does not apply (HCFA Ruling 97-1). Examples of benefit
    category based in §1861(ff) or §1835(a)(2)(F) of the Act, for
    partial hospitalization services generally include the following:

    -   Day care programs, which provide primarily social, recreational,
        > or diversionary activities, custodial or respite care;

    -   Programs attempting to maintain psychiatric wellness, where
        > there is no risk of relapse or hospitalization, e.g., day care
        > programs for the chronically mentally ill; or

    -   Patients who are otherwise psychiatrically stable or require
        > medication management only.

b.  Coverage denials made under §1861(ff) of the Act are not appealable
    by the provider and the Limitation on Liability provision does not
    apply (HCFA Ruling 97-1). The following services are excluded from
    the scope of partial hospitalization services defined in §1861(ff)
    of the Social Security Act:

    -   Services to hospital inpatients;

    -   Meals, self-administered medications, transportation; and

    -   Vocational training.

c.  Reasonable and necessary denials based on §1862(a)(1)(A) are
    appealable and the Limitation on Liability provision does apply. The
    following examples represent reasonable and necessary denials for
    partial hospitalization services and coverage is excluded under
    §1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act:

    -   Patients who cannot, or refuse, to participate (due to their
        > behavioral or cognitive status) with active treatment of their
        > mental disorder (except for a brief admission necessary for
        > diagnostic purposes), or who cannot tolerate the intensity of
        > a PHP; or

    -   Treatment of chronic conditions without acute exacerbation of
        > symptoms that place the individual at risk of relapse or
        > hospitalization.

    1.  ## Documentation Requirements and Physician Supervision

> The following components will be used to help determine whether the
> services provided were accurate and appropriate.

a.  [Initial Psychiatric Evaluation/Certification]{.underline}.\--Upon
    admission, a certification by the physician must be made that the
    patient admitted to the PHP would require inpatient psychiatric
    hospitalization if the partial hospitalization services were not
    provided. The certification should identify the diagnosis and
    psychiatric need for the partial hospitalization. Partial
    hospitalization services must be furnished under an individualized
    written plan of care, established by the physician, which includes
    the active treatment provided through the combination of structured,
    intensive services identified in §1861 that are reasonable and
    necessary to treat the presentation of serious psychiatric symptoms
    and to prevent relapse or hospitalization.

b.  [Physician Recertification Requirements]{.underline}.\--

    -   Signature -- The physician recertification must be signed by a
        > physician who is treating the patient and has knowledge of the
        > patient's response to treatment.

    -   Timing -- The first recertification is required as of the 18th
        > calendar day following admission to the PHP. Subsequent
        > recertifications are required at intervals established by the
        > provider, but no less frequently than every 30 days.

    -   Content -- The recertification must specify that the patient
        > would otherwise require inpatient psychiatric care in the
        > absence of continued stay in the PHP and describe the
        > following:

        -   The patient's response to the therapeutic interventions
            > provided by the PHP;

        -   The patient's psychiatric symptoms that continue to place
            > the patient at risk of hospitalization; and

        -   Treatment goals for coordination of services to facilitate
            > discharge from the PHP.

c.  [Treatment Plan]{.underline}.\--Partial hospitalization is active
    treatment pursuant to an individualized treatment plan, prescribed
    and signed by a physician, which identifies treatment goals,
    describes a coordination of services, is structured to meet the
    particular needs of the patient, and includes a multidisciplinary
    team approach to patient care. The treatment goals described in the
    treatment plan should directly address the presenting symptoms and
    are the basis for evaluating the patient's response to treatment.
    Treatment goals should be designed to measure the patient's response
    to active treatment. The plan should document ongoing efforts to
    restore the individual patient to a higher level of functioning that
    would permit discharge from the program, or reflect the continued
    need for the intensity of the active therapy to maintain the
    individual's condition and functional level and to prevent relapse
    or hospitalization. Activities that are primarily recreational and
    diversionary, or provide only a level of functional support that
    does not treat the serious presenting psychiatric symptoms placing
    the patient at risk, do not qualify as partial hospitalization
    services.

d.  [Progress Notes]{.underline}.\--Section 1833(e) of the Social
    Security Act prevents Medicare from paying for services unless
    necessary and sufficient information is submitted that shows that
    services were provided and to determine the amounts due. A provider
    may submit progress notes to document the services that have been
    provided. The progress note should include a description of the
    nature of the treatment service, the patient's response to the
    therapeutic intervention and its relation to the goals indicated in
    the treatment plan.

> See the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 4, "Hospital
> Outpatient Services,"

> §260 for billing instructions for partial hospitalization services.

# 70.5 - Laboratory Services Furnished to Nonhospital Patients by Hospital Laboratory

## (Rev. 82; Issued: 02-08-08; Effective: 01-01-08; Implementation: 03-10-08)

> A nonhospital patient is an individual who is neither an inpatient nor
> outpatient of the hospital furnishing the service. (See the Medicare
> Benefit Policy Manual, Pub. 100-02, Chapter 1, "Inpatient Hospital
> Services," section 10, for the definition of a hospital inpatient and
> section 20.1 for the definition of a hospital outpatient). Nonhospital
> patients primarily are individuals from whom a specimen had been taken
> and sent to the hospital for analysis and the patient does not receive
> hospital outpatient services on the same day. For all hospitals except
> CAHs and Maryland waiver hospitals, if a beneficiary receives hospital
> outpatient services on the same day as a specimen collection and
> laboratory test, then the patient is considered to be a registered
> hospital outpatient and cannot be considered to be a non-patient on
> that day for purposes of the specimen
>
> collection and laboratory test. However if the non-CAH or Maryland
> waiver hospital only collects or draws a specimen from the beneficiary
> and the beneficiary does not also receive hospital outpatient services
> on that day, the hospital may choose to register the beneficiary as an
> outpatient for the specimen collection or bill for these services as
> non- patient on the 14X bill type.
>
> For CAHs, payment for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests is made at
> 101 percent of reasonable cost, only if the individuals are
> outpatients of the CAH, as defined in 42 CFR 410.2, and are physically
> present in the CAH at the time the specimens are collected.
>
> Clinical diagnostic laboratory tests performed for persons who are not
> physically present (non-patients) at the CAH when the specimens are
> collected are made in accordance with the provisions of sections
> 1833(a)(1)(D) and 1833(a)(2)(D) of the Social Security Act.
>
> See also 42 CFR 413.70(b)(iii). Similarly, for Maryland waiver
> hospitals, the waiver is limited to services to inpatients and
> registered outpatients as defined in 42 CFR 410.2. Therefore payment
> for non-patients (specimen only, TOB 14X) who are not registered
> outpatients at the time of specimen collection will be made on the
> clinical diagnostic laboratory fee schedule. Such services are covered
> to the extent appropriate.
>
> See the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Pub. 100-04, Chapter 16,
> "Laboratory Services from Independent Labs, Physicians, and
> Providers," section 40.3, for billing and payment of clinical
> diagnostic laboratory services for patients and non-patients.

# 80 - Rental and Purchase of Durable Medical Equipment

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> **A3-3113, HO-235, HHA-220**
>
> Rental and purchase of DME is covered under Part B for use in a
> patient's home. DME rendered to inpatients of a SNF or hospital is
> covered as part of the prospective payment system and not separately
> payable. See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15,
>
> §§110 for coverage of Durable Medical Equipment and the Medicare
> Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 20, "Durable Medical Equipment,
> Prosthetics and Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS)," for special billing
> instructions.

# 90 - Services of Interns And Residents

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) A3-3115, HO-237

A.  **General**

> For Medicare purposes, the terms "interns" and "residents" include
> physicians participating in approved postgraduate training programs
> and physicians who are not in approved programs but who are authorized
> to practice only in a hospital setting, e.g., individuals with
> temporary or restricted licenses, or unlicensed graduates of foreign
> medical schools. Where a senior resident has a staff or faculty
> appointment or is designated, for example, a "fellow," it **does not**
> change the resident's status for the
>
> purposes of Medicare coverage and reimbursement. As a general rule,
> services of interns and residents are paid as provider services by the
> A/B MAC (A).

## Services Furnished by Interns and Residents Within the Scope of an Approved Training Program

> Medical and surgical services furnished by interns and residents
> within the scope of their training program are covered as provider
> services. Effective with services furnished on or after July 1, 1987,
> this includes services furnished in a setting which is not part of the
> provider where a hospital has agreed to incur all or substantially all
> of the costs of training in the nonprovider facility. Providers are
> required to notify the A/B MAC (B) of such agreements. Where the
> provider does not incur all or substantially all of the training costs
> and the services are performed by a licensed physician, the services
> are reimbursable on a reasonable charge basis by the A/B MAC (B).
> Prior to July 1, 1987, the covered services of interns and residents
> were reimbursed by the A/B MAC (B) on a reasonable charge basis as
> physician services if furnished by a licensed physician off the
> provider premises regardless of who incurred the training costs.

## Services Furnished by Interns and Residents Outside the Scope of an Approved Training Program - Moonlighting

> Medical and surgical services furnished by interns and residents that
> are not related to their training program, and are performed outside
> the facility where they have their training program, are covered as
> physicians' services and paid on a reasonable charge basis where the
> requirements in 1 and 2, below, are met. Medical and surgical services
> furnished by interns and residents that are not related to their
> training program, and are performed in an outpatient department or
> emergency room of the hospital where they have their training program,
> are covered as physicians' services and paid on a reasonable charge
> basis where the following criteria are met:

1.  The services are identifiable physicians' services, the nature of
    which requires performance by a physician in person and which
    contributes to the diagnosis or treatment of the patient's
    condition;

2.  The intern or resident is fully licensed to practice medicine,
    osteopathy, dentistry or podiatry by the State in which the services
    are performed; and

3.  The services performed can be separately identified from those
    services that are required as part of the training program.

> When these criteria are met, the services are considered to have been
> furnished by the individuals in their capacity as physicians and not
> in their capacity as interns and residents.
