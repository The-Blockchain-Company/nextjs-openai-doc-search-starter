# - Home Health Prospective Payment System (HH PPS)

### (Rev. 265, Issued: 01-10-20, Effective: 01-01-20, Implementation: 02-11-20)

> The unit of payment under the HH PPS is a national 30-day period rate
> with applicable adjustments. The periods, rate, and adjustments to the
> rates are detailed in the following sections.

# - National 30-Day Period Payment Rate

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

A.  **Services Included**

> The law requires the 30-day period to include all covered home health
> services, including medical supplies, paid on a reasonable cost basis.
> That means the 30-day period payment rate includes costs for the six
> home health disciplines and the costs for routine and nonroutine
> medical supplies. The six home health disciplines included in the
> 30-day period payment rate are:

1.  Skilled nursing services;

2.  Home health aide services;

3.  Physical therapy;

4.  Speech-language pathology services;

5.  Occupational therapy services; and

6.  Medical social services.

> The 30-day period payment rate also includes amounts for nonroutine
> medical supplies and therapies that could have been unbundled to Part
> B prior to HH PPS. (See [§10.11.C]{.underline} for those services.)

### Excluded Services

> The law specifically excludes durable medical equipment (DME) from the
> 30-day period payment rate and consolidated billing requirements. DME
> continues to be paid the fee schedule amounts or through the DME
> competitive bidding program outside of the HH PPS rate.
>
> Certain injectable osteoporosis drugs which are covered where a woman
> is post- menopausal and has a bone fracture are also excluded from the
> 30-day period payment rate, but must be billed by the home health
> agency (HHA) while a patient is under a home health plan of care since
> the law requires consolidated billing of these osteoporosis drugs.
> These osteoporosis drugs continue to be paid on a reasonable cost
> basis.
>
> Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) using a disposable device that
> is an integrated system comprised of a non-manual vacuum pump, a
> receptacle for collecting exudate, and dressings for the purposes of
> wound therapy (in lieu of a conventional NPWT DME system), is also
> excluded from the 30-day period payment rate, but must be billed by
> the home health agency (HHA) while a patient is under a home health
> plan of care since the law requires consolidated billing of NPWT using
> a disposable device.
>
> Furnishing NPWT using a disposable device means the application of a
> new applicable disposable device, as that term is defined in §1834 of
> the Social Security Act (the Act), which includes the professional
> services (specified by the assigned CPT code) that are provided.

# - Adjustments to the 30-Day Period Payment Rate

### (Rev. 265, Issued: 01-10-20, Effective: 01-01-20, Implementation: 02-11-20)

A.  **Case-Mix Adjustment**

> A case-mix methodology adjusts the 30-day payment rate based on
> characteristics of the patient and his/her corresponding resource
> needs (e.g., diagnoses, functional impairment level, and other
> factors). The 30-day period payment rate is adjusted by a case-mix
> methodology based on information from home health claims, other
> Medicare claims, and data elements from the Outcome and Assessment
> Information Set (OASIS). The claims information and OASIS data
> elements are used to group 30-day periods of care into their case-mix
> groups.
>
> The following case-mix variables are obtained from home health or
> other Medicare claims:

-   **Admission Source**-Institutional (i.e., acute hospital, inpatient
    rehabilitation facility, skilled nursing facility, long-term care
    hospital, inpatient psychiatric facility) or Community;

-   **Timing**-Early (the first 30-day period of care) or Late (all
    subsequent 30-day periods of care, unless there is a gap of more
    than 60-days between the end of one period of care and the start of
    another),

-   **Clinical Group**-As determined by the principal diagnosis reported
    on home health claims; 30-day periods are assigned to one of 12
    clinical groups describing the primary reason for the home health
    encounter:

-   **Comorbidity Adjustment**-As determined by certain secondary
    diagnoses reported on home health claims; a 30-day period of care
    can receive no comorbidity adjustment, a low comorbidity adjustment,
    or a high comorbidity adjustment.

> The following case mix variable is determined from responses to
> certain items on the OASIS assessment:

-   **Functional Impairment Level**-As determined by responses to
    certain OASIS items. A 30-day period of care can be assigned a low,
    medium, or high functional impairment level.

> Each 30-day period is assigned into one of 432 case-mix groups based
> on the variables described above. Each group's case-mix weight
> reflects the predicted mean cost of the group relative to the overall
> average across all groups.

### Labor Adjustments

> The labor portion of the 30-day period payment rate is adjusted to
> reflect the wage index based on the site of service of the
> beneficiary. The beneficiary\'s location is the determining factor for
> the labor adjustment. The HH PPS rates are adjusted by the pre- floor
> and pre-reclassified hospital wage index. The hospital wage index is
> adjusted to account for the geographic reclassification of hospitals
> in accordance with
>
> [[§§1886(d)(8)(B)]{.underline}](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1866.htm)
> and
> [[1886(d)(10)]{.underline}](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1866.htm)
> of the Social Security Act (the Act.) According to the law, geographic
> reclassification only applies to hospitals. Additionally, the hospital
> wage index has specific floors that are required by law. Because these
> reclassifications and floors do not apply to HHAs, the home health
> rates are adjusted by the pre-floor and pre- reclassified hospital
> wage index.
>
> **NOTE:** The pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage index
> varies slightly from the numbers published in the Medicare inpatient
> hospital PPS regulation that reflects the floor and reclassification
> adjustments. The wage indices published in the home health final rule
> and subsequent annual updates reflect the most recent available
> pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage index available at the
> time of publication.

# - Continuous 60-Day Recertifications

### (Rev. 265, Issued: 01-10-20, Effective: 01-01-20, Implementation: 02-11-20)

> While HH PPS payment is now made for each 30-day period, the home
> health PPS permits continuous 60-day recertifications for patients who
> continue to be eligible for the home health benefit. Medicare does not
> limit the number of continuous 60-day recertifications for
> beneficiaries who continue to be eligible for the home health benefit.
> Each 60-day certification can include two 30-day payment periods.
>
> Recertification is required at least every 60 days when there is a
> need for continuous home health care after an initial 60-day
> certification. The recertification visit can be done during the prior
> certification period. With some minor exceptions, the Medicare
> Conditions of Participation at 42 CFR 484.55(d)(1), require that the
> recertification assessment be done during the last 5 days of the
> previous certification period (for example, during the initial 60-day
> certification period, the recertification visit is required to be done
> on days 56-60).

>
> *Beginning January 1, 2022, HHAs will no longer submit Requests for
> Anticipated Payment (RAPs). Instead, for each admission to home
> health, the HHA notifies Medicare systems via submission of an NOA.
> The NOA is a one-time submission to establish that the beneficiary is
> under a home health period of care and trigger home health
> consolidated billing edits. The NOA covers contiguous 30-day periods
> of care until the individual is discharged from Medicare home health
> services. There is no upfront payment with the submission of the NOA.*
>
> *The NOA must be submitted timely. All HHAs must submit an NOA to
> their Medicare contractor within 5 calendar days from the start of
> care date to establish that the beneficiary is under a Medicare home
> health period of care and also to trigger home health consolidated
> billing edits required under section 1842(b)(6)(F) of the Act. For
> example, if the start of care date is January 1, 2022, the NOA would

>
> *CMS may waive the consequences of failure to submit a timely-filed
> NOA if it is determined that a circumstance encountered by a home

> limited to the following:*

-   *Fires, floods, earthquakes, or similar unusual events that inflict
    extensive damage to the home health agency's ability to operate.*

-   *A CMS or Medicare contractor systems issue that is beyond the

-   *A newly Medicare-certified home health agency that is notified of
    that certification after the Medicare certification date, or which
    is awaiting its user ID from its Medicare contractor.*

-   *Other situations determined by CMS to be beyond the control of the
    home health agency.*

# - Low Utilization Payment Adjustment (LUPA)

### (Rev. 265, Issued: 01-10-20, Effective: 01-01-20, Implementation: 02-11-20)

> The LUPA threshold varies for a 30-day period of care depending on the
> payment group to which it is assigned. For each payment group, the
> 10th percentile value of visits is used to create a payment
> group-specific LUPA threshold with a minimum threshold of at least 2
> visits for each group. A 30-day period with visits less than the LUPA
> threshold for the payment group is paid the national per visit amount
> by discipline adjusted by the appropriate wage index based on the site
> of service of the beneficiary. Such periods that do not meet the LUPA
> threshold for the payment group are paid the wage-adjusted per visit
> amount for each of the visits rendered instead of the full 30-day
> period payment amount. The national per visit amounts by discipline
> (skilled nursing, home health aide, physical therapy, speech-language
> pathology, occupational therapy, and medical social services) are
> updated and published annually by the applicable market basket for
> each visit type. To offset the full cost of longer, initial visits in
> some LUPA periods, the LUPA payment is increased by an add-on amount
> for LUPAs that occur as the only 30- day period or the initial 30-day
> period during a sequence of adjacent periods.

# - Partial Payment Adjustment

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

A.  **Partial Payment Adjustment Criteria**

> An HHA receives a national, standardized 30-day payment of a
> predetermined rate for home health services unless CMS determines an
> intervening event warrants a new 30- day period for purposes of
> payment.
>
> The partial payment adjustment is a proportion of the period payment
> and is based on the span of days including the start-of-care date (for
> example, the date of the first billable service) through and including
> the last billable service date under the original plan of care before
> the intervening event, defined as a---

-   Beneficiary elected transfer, or

-   Discharge and return to home health that would warrant, for purposes
    of payment, a

> new OASIS assessment, certification of eligibility, and a new plan of
> care.
>
> When a new 30-day period begins due to an intervening event, the
> original 30-day period will be proportionally adjusted to reflect the
> length of time the beneficiary remained under the agency's care prior
> to the intervening event. The proportional payment is the partial
> payment adjustment.

### Methodology Used to Calculate Partial Payment Adjustment

> The partial payment adjustment for the original 30-day period is
> calculated to reflect the
>
> length of time the beneficiary remained under the care of the original
> HHA based on the first billable visit date through and including the
> last billable visit date. The partial payment adjustment will be
> calculated by using the span of days (first billable service date
> through and including the last billable service date) under the
> original plan of care as a proportion of the 30-day period. The
> proportion will then be multiplied by the original case-mix and wage
> index to produce the 30-day payment.

### Common Ownership Exception to Partial Payment Adjustment

> The partial payment adjustment does not apply in situations of
> transfers among HHAs of common ownership. Those situations would be
> considered services provided under arrangement on behalf of the
> originating HHA by the receiving HHA with the ownership interest until
> the end of the 30-day period. The common ownership exception to the
> transfer partial payment adjustment does not apply if the beneficiary
> moved out of their Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or non-MSA
> during the 30-day period before the transfer to the receiving HHA.

### Beneficiary Elected Transfer Verification

> In order for a receiving HHA to accept a beneficiary elected transfer,
> the receiving HHA must document that the beneficiary has been informed
> that the initial HHA will no longer receive Medicare payment on behalf
> of the patient and will no longer provide Medicare covered services to
> the patient after the date of the patient\'s elected transfer in
> accordance with current patient rights requirements at [[42 CFR
> 484.50(d)]{.underline}.](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title42-vol5/pdf/CFR-2014-title42-vol5-sec484-10.pdf)
> The receiving HHA must also document in the record that it accessed
> the Medicare contractor's inquiry system to determine whether or not
> the patient was under an established home health plan of care and it
> must contact the initial HHA on the effective date of transfer. In the
> rare circumstance of a dispute between HHAs, the Medicare contractor
> is responsible for working with both HHAs to resolve the dispute. If
> the receiving HHA can provide documentation of its notice of patient
> rights on Medicare payment liability provided to the patient upon
> transfer and its contact of the initial HHA of the transfer date, then
> the initial HHA will be ineligible for payment for the period of
> overlap in addition to the appropriate partial payment adjustment. If
> the receiving HHA cannot provide the appropriate documentation, the
> receiving HHA\'s RAP and/or final claim will be cancelled, and full
> period payment will be provided to the initial HHA. For the receiving
> HHA to properly document that it contacted the initial HHA on the
> effective date of transfer it must maintain similar information as the
> initial HHA, including the same basic beneficiary information,
> personnel contacted, dates and times. The initial HHA must also
> properly document that it was contacted and it accepted the transfer.
> Where it disputes a transfer, the initial HHA must call its Medicare
> contractor to resolve the dispute. The Medicare contractor is
> responsible for working with both HHAs to resolve the dispute.

# - Outlier Payments

### (Rev. 265, Issued: 01-10-20, Effective: 01-01-20, Implementation: 02-11-20)

> When cases experience an unusually high level of services in a 30-day
> period, Medicare systems will provide additional or \"outlier\"
> payments to the case-mix and wage-adjusted
>
> 30-day period payment. Outlier payments can result from medically
> necessary high utilization in any or all-home health service
> disciplines. CMS makes outlier payments when the cost of care exceeds
> a threshold dollar amount. The outlier threshold for each case-mix
> group is the 30-day period payment amount for that group or the
> partial payment adjustment amount for the 30-day period, plus a fixed
> dollar loss amount, which is the same for all case-mix groups. The
> outlier payment is a proportion of the amount of imputed costs beyond
> the threshold. CMS calculates the imputed cost for each 30-day period
> by first taking the national per-visit payment amounts for each
> discipline and calculating per-unit payment amounts (1 unit = 15
> minutes). The per-unit amounts are then multiplied by the number of
> units in the discipline and computing the total imputed cost for all
> disciplines (summed across the six disciplines of care).
>
> If the imputed cost for the 30-day period is greater than the sum of
> the case-mix and wage-adjusted 30-day period payment plus the fixed
> dollar loss amount (the outlier threshold), a set percentage (the loss
> sharing ratio) of the difference between the imputed amount and
> outlier threshold will be paid to the HHA as a wage-adjusted outlier
> payment in addition to the 30-day period payment.
>
> The amount of the outlier payment is determined as follows:

1.  Calculate the case-mix and wage-adjusted 30-day period payment
    (including non- routine supplies (NRS));

2.  Add the wage-adjusted fixed dollar loss amount. The sum of steps 1
    and 2 is the outlier threshold for the 30-day period;

3.  Calculate the wage-adjusted imputed cost of the 30-day period by
    first multiplying the total number of units for each home health
    discipline by the national per unit amounts, and wage-adjusting
    those amounts. Sum the per discipline wage-adjusted imputed amounts
    to yield the total wage-adjusted imputed cost for the 30-day period;

4.  Subtract the total imputed cost for the 30-day period (total from
    Step 3) from the sum of the case-mix and wage-adjusted 30-day period
    payment and the wage- adjusted fixed dollar loss amount (sum of
    Steps 1 and 2 - outlier threshold);

5.  Multiply the difference by the loss sharing ratio; and

6.  That total amount is the outlier payment for the 30-day period.

> Effective January 1, 2010, an outlier cap precludes any HHA from
> receiving more than 10 percent of their total home health payment in
> outliers.

# - Discharge Issues

### (Rev. 265, Issued: 01-10-20, Effective: 01-01-20, Implementation: 02-11-20)

A.  **Hospice Election Mid-Period**

> If a patient elects hospice before the end of the 30-day period and
> there was no PEP or LUPA adjustment, the HHA will receive a full
> 30-day period payment. The 30-day period with visits less than the
> LUPA threshold for the payment group would be paid at the low
> utilization payment adjusted amount.

### Patient\'s Death

> The documented event of a patient\'s death would result in a full
> 30-day period payment, unless the death occurred in a low utilization
> payment adjusted 30-day period. Consistent with all episodes in which
> a patient receives four or fewer visits, if the patient\'s death
> occurred during a low utilization adjusted 30-day payment period, the
> period would be paid at the low utilization payment adjusted amount.
> In the event of a patient\'s death during an adjusted 30-day period,
> the total adjusted period would constitute the full 30- day period
> payment.

### Patient is No Longer Eligible for Home Health (e.g., no longer homebound, no skilled need)

> If the patient is discharged because he or she is no longer eligible
> for the Medicare home health benefit and has received visits meeting
> the LUPA threshold for the payment group, then the HHA would receive
> the full 30-day period payment. However, if the patient becomes
> subsequently eligible for the Medicare home health benefit during the
> same 30- day period and transferred to another HHA or returned to the
> same HHA, then this would result in a partial payment adjustment.

### Discharge Due to Patient Refusal of Services or is a Documented Safety Threat, Abuse Threat or is Noncompliant

> If the patient is discharged because he or she refuses services or
> becomes a documented safety, abuse, or noncompliance discharge and has
> received visits meeting the LUPA threshold for the payment group, then
> the HHA would receive full period payment unless the patient becomes
> subsequently eligible for the Medicare home health benefit during the
> same 30-day period and transferred to another HHA or returned to the
> same HHA, then this would result in a PEP adjustment.

### Patient Enrolls in Managed Care Mid-Period

> If a patient\'s enrollment in a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan becomes
> effective mid period, the 30-day period payment will be proportionally
> adjusted with a partial payment adjustment since the patient is
> receiving coverage under MA. Beginning with the effective date of
> enrollment, the MA plan will receive a capitation payment for covered
> services.

### Submission of Final Claims Prior to the End of the 30-day Period

> The claim may be submitted upon discharge before the end of the 30-day
> period. However, subsequent adjustments to any payments based on the
> claim may be made due to an intervening event resulting in a partial
> payment adjustment or other adjustment.

### Patient Discharge and Financial Responsibility for Part B Bundled Medical Supplies and Services

> As discussed in detail under §10.11, below, the law governing the
> Medicare HH PPS requires the HHA to provide all bundled home health
> services (except DME) either directly or under arrangement while a
> patient is under an open home health plan of care during an open
> episode. Once the patient is discharged, the HHA is no longer
> responsible for providing home health services including the bundled
> Part B medical supplies and therapy services.

H.  ### Discharge Issues Associated With Inpatient Admission Overlapping Into Subsequent 60-Day Recertifications

    1.  If a patient is admitted to an inpatient facility and the
        inpatient stay overlaps into what would have been the subsequent
        60-day recertification and there is no recertification
        assessment of the patient, then the new certification begins
        with the new start of care date after inpatient discharge.

    2.  If a patient is admitted to an inpatient facility and the
        inpatient stay overlaps into what would have been the subsequent
        60-day recertification and there was a recertification
        assessment of the patient during days 56-60 and the patient
        returns home from the inpatient stay on day 61, if the home
        health resource group (HHRG) remains the same then the 30-day
        period of care following the inpatient stay would be considered
        continuous and thus be considered a recertification. However, if
        the HHRG is different, this would result in a new start of care
        OASIS and thus be considered a new certification and begins with
        the new start of care date after inpatient discharge.

    3.  If a patient is admitted to an inpatient facility and the
        inpatient stay overlaps into what would have been the subsequent
        60-day recertification and there was a recertification
        assessment of the patient during days 56-60 and the patient
        returns home from the inpatient stay after day 61 (after the
        first day of the next 60-day recertification of care), then a
        new certification begins with the new start of care date after
        inpatient discharge.

    1.  # - Consolidated Billing

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> For individuals under a home health plan of care, payment for all
> services and supplies, with the exception of certain injectable
> osteoporosis drugs, DME, and furnishing NPWT using a disposable device
> is included in the HH PPS base payment rates. HHAs must provide the
> covered home health services (except DME) either directly or under
> arrangement, and must bill for such covered home health services.
>
> Payment must be made to the HHA.

### Home Health Services Subject to Consolidated Billing Requirements

> The home health services included in the consolidated billing
> governing the HH PPS are:

-   Part-time or intermittent skilled nursing services;

-   Part-time or intermittent home health aide services;

-   Physical therapy;

-   Speech-language pathology services;

-   Occupational therapy;

-   Medical social services;

-   Routine and nonroutine medical supplies;

-   Covered osteoporosis drug as defined in
    [[§1861(kk)]{.underline}](http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1861.htm)
    of the Act, but excluding other drugs and biologicals;

-   Furnishing NPWT using a disposable device as that term is defined in
    §1834 of the Act, which includes the professional services
    (specified by the assigned CPT code) that are provided;

-   Medical services provided by an intern or resident-in-training of
    the program of the hospital in the case of an HHA that is affiliated
    or under common control with a hospital with an approved teaching
    program; and

-   Home health services defined in
    [[§1861(m)](http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1861.htm) of
    the Act]{.underline} provided under arrangement at hospitals, SNFs,
    or rehabilitation centers when they involve equipment too cumbersome
    to bring to the home or are furnished while the patient is at the
    facility to receive such services.

### Medical Supplies

> The law requires that all medical supplies (routine and nonroutine) be
> provided by the HHA while the patient is under a home health plan of
> care. The agency that establishes the 30-day period is the only entity
> that can bill and receive payment for medical supplies during a 30-day
> period for a patient under a home health plan of care. Both routine
> and nonroutine medical supplies are included in the base rates for
> every Medicare home health patient regardless of whether or not the
> patient requires medical supplies during the 30-day period.
>
> Due to the consolidated billing requirements, CMS provided additional
> amounts in the base rates for those nonroutine medical supplies that
> have a duplicate Part B code that could have been unbundled to Part B
> prior to HH PPS. See §50.4 for detailed discussion of medical
> supplies.
>
> Medical supplies used by the patient, provider, or other practitioners
> under arrangement on behalf of the agency (other than physicians) are
> subject to consolidated billing and bundled into the HHA 30-day period
> payment rate. Once a patient is discharged from home health and not
> under a home health plan of care, the HHA is not responsible for
> medical supplies.
>
> DME, including supplies covered as DME, are paid separately from the
> HH PPS and are excluded from the consolidated billing requirements
> governing the HH PPS. The determining factor is the medical
> classification of the supply, not the diagnosis of the patient.
>
> Certain injectable osteoporosis drugs are included in consolidated
> billing under the home health benefit. However, payment is not bundled
> into the HH PPS payment rates. HHAs must bill for the osteoporosis
> drug in accordance with billing instructions. Payment is in addition
> to the HH PPS payment.
>
> Furnishing NPWT using a disposable device is included in consolidated
> billing under the home health benefit. However, payment is not bundled
> into the HH PPS payment rates. HHAs must bill for NPWT using a
> disposable device in accordance with billing instructions. Payment is
> in addition to the HH PPS payment.

### Relationship Between Consolidated Billing Requirements and Part B Supplies and Part B Therapies Included in the Baseline Rates That Could Have Been Unbundled Prior to HH PPS That No Longer Can Be Unbundled

> The HHA is responsible for the services provided under arrangement on
> their behalf by other entities. Covered home health services at
> [[§1861(m)]{.underline}](http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1861.htm)
> of the Act (except DME) are included in the baseline HH PPS rates and
> subject to the consolidated billing requirements while the patient is
> under a plan of care of the HHA. The time the services are bundled is
> while the patient is under a home health plan of care.
>
> Physician services or nurse practitioner services paid under the
> physician fee schedule are not recognized as home health services
> included in the PPS rates. Supplies incident to a physician service or
> related to a physician service billed to the Medicare contractor are
> not subject to the consolidated billing requirements. The physician
> would not be acting as a supplier billing the DME Medicare contractor
> in this situation.
>
> Therapies (physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language
> pathology services) are covered home health services that are included
> in the baseline rates and subject to the consolidated billing
> requirements. In addition to therapies that had been paid on a cost
> basis under home health, CMS has included in the rates additional
> amounts for Part B therapies that could have been unbundled prior to
> PPS. These therapies are subject to the consolidated billing
> requirements. There are revenue center codes that
>
> reflect the ranges of outpatient physical therapy, occupational
> therapy, and speech- language pathology services and Healthcare Common
> Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes that reflect physician supplier
> codes that are physical therapy, occupational therapy, and
> speech-language pathology services by code definition and are subject
> to the consolidated billing requirements. Therefore, the
> above-mentioned therapies must be provided directly or under
> arrangement on behalf of the HHA while a patient is under a home
> health plan of care and cannot be separately billed to Part B during
> an open 30-day period of care.

### Freedom of Choice Issues

> A beneficiary exercises his or her freedom of choice for the services
> under the home health benefit listed in
> [[§1861(m)]{.underline}](http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1861.htm)
> of the Act, including medical supplies, but excluding DME covered as a
> home health service by choosing the HHA. Once a home health patient
> chooses a particular HHA, he or she has clearly exercised freedom of
> choice with respect to all items and services included within the
> scope of the Medicare home health benefit (except DME). The HHA\'s
> consolidated billing role supersedes all other billing situations the
> beneficiary may wish to establish for home health services covered
> under the scope of the Medicare home health benefit during the
> certified episode**.**

### Knowledge of Services Arranged for on Behalf of the HHA

> The consolidated billing requirements governing HH PPS requires that
> the HHA provide all covered home health services (except DME) either
> directly or under arrangement while a patient is under a home health
> plan of care. Providing services either directly or under arrangement
> requires knowledge of the services provided during the 30-day period.
> In addition, in accordance with current Medicare conditions of
> participation and Medicare coverage guidelines governing home health,
> the patient\'s plan of care must reflect the physician or allowed
> practitioner ordered services that the HHA provides either directly or
> under arrangement. An HHA would not be responsible for payment in the
> situation in which they have no prior knowledge (unaware of physician
> or allowed practitioner orders) of the services provided by an entity
> during a 30-day period to a patient who is under their home health
> plan of care. An HHA is responsible for payment in the situation in
> which services are provided to a patient by another entity, under
> arrangement with the HHA, during a 30-day period in which the patient
> is under the HHA\'s home health plan of care. However, it is in the
> best interest of future business relationships to discuss the
> situation with any entity that seeks payment from the HHA during a
> 30-day period in an effort to resolve any misunderstanding and avoid
> such situations in the future.

# - Conditions To Be Met for Coverage of Home Health Services

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) A3-3116, HHA-203

> Medicare covers HHA services when the following criteria are met:

1.  The person to whom the services are provided is an eligible Medicare
    beneficiary;

2.  The HHA that is providing the services to the beneficiary has in
    effect a valid agreement to participate in the Medicare program;

3.  The beneficiary qualifies for coverage of home health services as
    described in

> [[§30]{.underline}](#conditions-patient-must-meet-to-qualify-for-coverage-of-home-health-services);

4.  The services for which payment is claimed are covered as described
    in
    [[§§40]{.underline}](#covered-services-under-a-qualifying-home-health-plan-of-care)
    and [[50]{.underline}](#coverage-of-other-home-health-services);

5.  Medicare is the appropriate payer; and

6.  The services for which payment is claimed are not otherwise excluded
    from payment.

    1.  # - Reasonable and Necessary Services

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3116.1. HHA-203.1**

# - Background

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> In enacting the Medicare program, Congress recognized that the
> physician or allowed practitioner would play an important role in
> determining utilization of services. The law requires that payment can
> be made only if a physician or allowed practitioner certifies the need
> for services and establishes a plan of care. The Secretary is
> responsible for ensuring that Medicare covers the claimed services,
> including determining whether they are \"reasonable and necessary.\"

# - Determination of Coverage

### (Rev. 208, Issued: 04-22-15, Effective: 01-01-15, Implementation: 05-11-15)

> The Medicare contractor's decision on whether care is reasonable and
> necessary is based on information reflected in the home health plan of
> care, the OASIS as required by
> [[42]{.underline}](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title42-vol5/pdf/CFR-2014-title42-vol5-sec484-55.pdf)
> [[CFR
> 484.55]{.underline}](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title42-vol5/pdf/CFR-2014-title42-vol5-sec484-55.pdf)
> or a medical record of the individual patient. Medicare does not deny
> coverage solely on the basis of the reviewer\'s general inferences
> about patients with similar diagnoses or on data related to
> utilization generally, but bases it upon objective clinical evidence
> regarding the patient\'s individual need for care. Coverage of skilled
> nursing care or therapy to perform a maintenance program does not turn
> on the presence or absence of a patient's potential for improvement
> from the nursing care or therapy, but rather on the patient's need for
> skilled care. Skilled care may be necessary to improve a patient's
> current condition, to maintain the patient's current condition, to
> prevent or slow further deterioration of the patient's condition.

# - Impact of Other Available Caregivers and Other Available Coverage on Medicare Coverage of Home Health Services

### (Rev. 208, Issued: 04-22-15, Effective: 01-01-15, Implementation: 05-11-15)

> Where the Medicare criteria for coverage of home health services are
> met, patients are entitled by law to coverage of reasonable and
> necessary home health services. Therefore, a patient is entitled to
> have the costs of reasonable and necessary services reimbursed by
> Medicare without regard to whether there is someone available to
> furnish the services.
>
> However, where a family member or other person is or will be providing
> services that adequately meet the patient\'s needs, it would not be
> reasonable and necessary for HHA personnel to furnish such services.
> Ordinarily it can be presumed that there is no able and willing person
> in the home to provide the services being rendered by the HHA unless
> the patient or family indicates otherwise and objects to the provision
> of the services by the HHA, or unless the HHA has first hand knowledge
> to the contrary.
>
> Similarly, a patient is entitled to reasonable and necessary Medicare
> home health services even if the patient would qualify for
> institutional care (e.g., hospital care or skilled nursing facility
> care) and Medicare payment should be made for reasonable and necessary
> home health services where the patient is also receiving supplemental
> services that do not meet Medicare's definition of skilled nursing
> care or home health aide services.

## EXAMPLE 1:

> A patient who lives with an adult daughter and otherwise qualifies for
> Medicare coverage of home health services, requires the assistance of
> a home health aide for bathing and assistance with an exercise program
> to improve endurance. The daughter is unwilling to bathe her elderly
> father and assist him with the exercise program. Home health aide
> services would be reasonable and necessary.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> A patient who is being discharged from a hospital with a diagnosis of
> osteomyelitis and requires continuation of the I.V. antibiotic therapy
> that was begun in the hospital was found to meet the criteria for
> Medicare coverage of skilled nursing facility services. If the patient
> also meets the qualifying criteria for coverage of home health
> services, payment may be made for the reasonable and necessary home
> health services the patient needs, notwithstanding the availability of
> coverage in a skilled nursing facility.

## EXAMPLE 3:

> A patient who needs skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis also
> hires a licensed practical (vocational) nurse to provide nighttime
> assistance while family members sleep. The care provided by the nurse,
> as respite to the family members, does not require the skills of a
> licensed nurse (as defined in
> [[§40.1]{.underline}](#skilled-nursing-care)) and therefore has no
> impact on the beneficiary\'s eligibility for Medicare payment of home
> health services even though another third party insurer may pay for
> that nursing care.

# - Use of Utilization Screens and \"Rules of Thumb\"

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

## A3-3116.3, HHA-203.3

> Medicare recognizes that determinations of whether home health
> services are reasonable and necessary must be based on an assessment
> of each beneficiary\'s individual care needs. Therefore, denial of
> services based on numerical utilization screens, diagnostic screens,
> diagnosis or specific treatment norms is not appropriate.

# - Conditions Patient Must Meet to Qualify for Coverage of Home Health Services

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> To qualify for the Medicare home health benefit, under

> and
> [[1835(a)(2)(A)]{.underline}](https://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1835.htm)
> of the Act, a Medicare beneficiary must meet the following
> requirements:

-   Be confined to the home;

-   Under the care of a physician or allowed practitioner;

-   Receiving services under a plan of care established and periodically
    reviewed by a physician or allowed practitioner;

-   Be in need of skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis or
    physical therapy or speech-language pathology; or

-   Have a continuing need for occupational therapy.

> For purposes of benefit eligibility, under §§1814(a)(2)(C) and
> 1835(a)(2)(A) of the Act, \"intermittent\" means skilled nursing care
> that is either provided or needed on fewer than 7 days each week or
> less than 8 hours of each day for periods of 21 days or less (with
> extensions in exceptional circumstances when the need for additional

# - Confined to the Home

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3117.1, HHA-204.1**

# - Patient Confined to the Home

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> For a patient to be eligible to receive covered home health services
> under both Part A and Part B, the law requires that a physician or
> allowed practitioner certify in all cases that the patient is confined
> to his/her home. For purposes of the statute, an individual shall be
> considered "confined to the home" (homebound) if the following two
> criteria are met:

1.  Criterion One:

> The patient must either:

-   Because of illness or injury, need the aid of supportive devices
    > such as crutches, canes, wheelchairs, and walkers; the use of
    > special transportation; or the assistance of another person in
    > order to leave their place of residence

> OR

-   Have a condition such that leaving his or her home is medically
    > contraindicated.

> If the patient meets one of the criterion one conditions, then the
> patient must ALSO meet two additional requirements defined in
> criterion two below.

2.  Criterion Two:

    -   There must exist a normal inability to leave home; AND

    -   Leaving home must require a considerable and taxing effort.

> To clarify, in determining whether the patient meets criterion two of
> the homebound definition, the clinician needs to take into account the
> illness or injury for which the patient met criterion one and consider
> the illness or injury in the context of the patient's overall
> condition. The clinician is not required to include standardized
> phrases reflecting the patient's condition (e.g., repeating the words
> "taxing effort to leave the home") in the patient's chart, nor are
> such phrases sufficient, by themselves, to demonstrate that criterion
> two has been met. For example, longitudinal clinical information about
> the patient's health status is typically needed to sufficiently
> demonstrate a normal inability to leave the home and that leaving home
> requires a considerable and taxing effort. Such clinical information
> about the patient's overall health status may include, but is not
> limited to, such factors as the patient's diagnosis, duration of the
> patient's condition, clinical course (worsening or improvement),
> prognosis, nature and extent of functional limitations, other
> therapeutic interventions and results, etc.
>
> If the patient does in fact leave the home, the patient may
> nevertheless be considered homebound if the absences from the home are
> infrequent or for periods of relatively short duration, or are
> attributable to the need to receive health care treatment. Absences
> attributable to the need to receive health care treatment include, but
> are not limited to:

-   Attendance at adult day centers to receive medical care;

-   Ongoing receipt of outpatient kidney dialysis; or

-   The receipt of outpatient chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

> Any absence of an individual from the home attributable to the need to
> receive health care treatment, including regular absences for the
> purpose of participating in therapeutic, psychosocial, or medical
> treatment in an adult day-care program that is licensed or certified
> by a state, or accredited to furnish adult day-care services in a
> state, shall not disqualify an individual from being considered to be
> confined to his home. Any other absence of an individual from the home
> shall not so disqualify an individual if the absence is of an
> infrequent or of relatively short duration. For purposes of the
> preceding sentence, any absence for the purpose of attending a
> religious service shall be deemed to
>
> be an absence of infrequent or short duration. It is expected that in
> most instances, absences from the home that occur will be for the
> purpose of receiving health care treatment. However, occasional
> absences from the home for nonmedical purposes, e.g., an occasional
> trip to the barber, a walk around the block or a drive, attendance at
> a family reunion, funeral, graduation, or other infrequent or unique
> event would not necessitate a finding that the patient is not
> homebound if the absences are undertaken on an infrequent basis or are
> of relatively short duration and do not indicate that the patient has
> the capacity to obtain the health care provided outside rather than in
> the home.
>
> Some examples of homebound patients that illustrate the factors used
> to determine whether a homebound condition exists are listed below.

-   A patient paralyzed from a stroke who is confined to a wheelchair or
    requires the aid of crutches in order to walk.

-   A patient who is blind or senile and requires the assistance of
    another person in leaving their place of residence.

-   A patient who has lost the use of their upper extremities and,
    therefore, is unable to open doors, use handrails on stairways,
    etc., and requires the assistance of another individual to leave
    their place of residence.

-   A patient in the late stages of ALS or neurodegenerative
    disabilities. In determining whether the patient has the general
    inability to leave the home and leaves the home only infrequently or
    for periods of short duration, it is necessary (as is the case in
    determining whether skilled nursing services are intermittent) to
    look at the patient\'s condition over a period of time rather than
    for short periods within the home health stay. For example, a
    patient may leave the home (meeting both criteria listed above) more
    frequently during a short period when the patient has multiple
    appointments with health care professionals and medical tests in 1
    week. So long as the patient\'s overall condition and experience is
    such that he or she meets these qualifications, he or she should be
    considered confined to the home.

-   A patient who has just returned from a hospital stay involving
    surgery, who may be suffering from resultant weakness and pain
    because of the surgery and; therefore, their actions may be
    restricted by their physician or allowed practitioner to certain
    specified and limited activities (such as getting out of bed only
    for a specified period of time, walking stairs only once a day,
    etc.).

-   A patient with arteriosclerotic heart disease of such severity that
    they must avoid all stress and physical activity.

-   A patient with a psychiatric illness that is manifested in part by a
    refusal to leave home or is of such a nature that it would not be
    considered safe for the patient to leave home unattended, even if
    they have no physical limitations.

> The aged person who does not often travel from home because of frailty
> and insecurity brought on by advanced age would not be considered
> confined to the home for purposes of receiving home health services
> unless they meet one of the above conditions.
>
> Although a patient must be confined to the home to be eligible for
> covered home health services, some services cannot be provided at the
> patient\'s residence because equipment is required that cannot be made
> available there. If the services required by an individual involve the
> use of such equipment, the HHA may make arrangements with a hospital,
> SNF, or a rehabilitation center to provide these services on an
> outpatient basis. (See
>
> [[§50.6]{.underline}](#rev.-10438-issued-11-06-20-effective-03-01-20-implementation-01--11-21-36).)
> However, even in these situations, for the services to be covered as
> home health services the patient must be considered confined to home
> and meet both criteria listed above.
>
> If a question is raised as to whether a patient is confined to the
> home, the HHA will be requested to furnish the Medicare contractor
> with the information necessary to establish that the patient is
> homebound as defined above.

# - Patient\'s Place of Residence

### (Rev. 265, Issued: 01-10-20, Effective: 01-01-20, Implementation: 02-11-20)

> A patient\'s residence is wherever he or she makes his or her home.
> This may be his or her own dwelling, an apartment, a relative\'s home,
> a home for the aged, or some other type of institution. However, an
> institution may not be considered a patient\'s residence if the
> institution meets the requirements of
> [[§§1861(e)(1)](https://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1861.htm)]{.underline}
> or
> [[1819(a)(1)]{.underline}](https://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1819.htm)
> of the Act..
>
> Included in this group are hospitals and skilled nursing facilities,
> as well as most nursing facilities under Medicaid. (See the Medicare
> State Operations Manual, §2166.)
>
> Thus, if a patient is in an institution or distinct part of an
> institution identified above, the patient is not entitled to have
> payment made for home health services under either Part A or Part B
> since such an institution may not be considered their residence. When
> a patient remains in a participating SNF following their discharge
> from active care, the facility may not be considered their residence
> for purposes of home health coverage.
>
> A patient may have more than one home and the Medicare rules do not
> prohibit a patient from having one or more places of residence. A
> patient, under a Medicare home health plan of care, who resides in
> more than one place of residence during a period of Medicare covered
> home health services will not disqualify the patient\'s homebound
> status for purposes of eligibility. For example, a person may reside
> in a principal home and also a second vacation home, mobile home, or
> the home of a caretaker relative. The fact that the patient resides in
> more than one home and, as a result, must transit from one to the
> other, is not in itself, an indication that the patient is not
> homebound. The requirements of homebound must be met at each location
> (i.e., the patient must meet both criteria listed in section 30.1.1
> above).

### Assisted Living Facilities, Group Homes, and Personal Care Homes

> An individual may be \"confined to the home\" for purposes of Medicare
> coverage of home health services if he or she resides in an
> institution that is not primarily engaged in providing to inpatients:

-   Diagnostic and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis;

-   Treatment;

-   Care of injured, disabled or sick persons;

-   Rehabilitation services or other skilled services needed to maintain
    a patient's current condition or to prevent or slow further
    deterioration; or

-   Skilled nursing care or related services for patients who require
    medical or nursing care.

> If it is determined that the assisted living facility (also called
> personal care homes, group homes, etc.) in which the individuals
> reside are not primarily engaged in providing the above services, then
> Medicare will cover reasonable and necessary home health care
> furnished to these individuals.
>
> If it is determined that the services furnished by the home health
> agency are duplicative of services furnished by an assisted living
> facility when provision of such care is required of the facility under
> State licensure requirements, claims for such services should be
> denied under
> [[§1862(a)(1)(A)]{.underline}](https://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1862.htm)
> of the Act. Section 1862(a)(1)(A) excludes services that are not
> necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to
> improve the functioning of a malformed body member from Medicare
> coverage. Services to people who already have access to appropriate
> care from a willing caregiver would not be considered reasonable and
> necessary to the treatment of the individual\'s illness or injury.
>
> Medicare coverage would not be an optional substitute for the services
> that a facility is required to provide by law to its patients or where
> the services are included in the base contract of the facility. An
> individual\'s choice to reside in such a facility is also a choice to
> accept the services it holds itself out as offering to its patients.

### Day Care Centers and Patient\'s Place of Residence

> The current statutory definition of homebound or confined does not
> imply that Medicare coverage has been expanded to include adult day
> care services.
>
> The law does not permit an HHA to furnish a Medicare covered billable
> visit to a patient under a home health plan of care outside his or her
> home, except in those limited circumstances where the patient needs to
> use medical equipment that is too cumbersome to bring to the home.
> Section 1861(m) of the Act stipulates that home health services
> provided to a patient be provided to the patient on a visiting basis
> in a place of residence used as the individual\'s home. A
> licensed/certified day care center does not meet the definition of a
> place of residence.

### State Licensure/Certification of Day Care Facilities

> Per [[Section
> 1861(m)]{.underline}](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1861.htm)
> of the Act, an adult day care center must be either licensed or
> certified by the State or accredited by a private accrediting body.
> State licensure or certification as an adult day care facility must be
> based on State interpretations of its process. For example, several
> States do not license adult day care facilities as a whole, but do
> certify some entities as Medicaid certified centers for purposes of
> providing adult day care under the Medicaid home and community based
> waiver program. It is the responsibility of the State to determine the
> necessary criteria for \"State certification\" in such a situation. A
> State could determine that Medicaid certification is an acceptable
> standard and consider its Medicaid certified adult day care facilities
> to be \"State certified.\" On the other hand, a State could determine
> Medicaid certification to be insufficient and require other conditions
> to be met before the adult day care facility is considered \"State
> certified\".

### Determination of the Therapeutic, Medical or Psychosocial Treatment of the Patient at the Day Care Facility

> It is not the obligation of the HHA to determine whether the adult day
> care facility is providing psychosocial treatment, but only to assure
> that the adult day care center is licensed/certified by the State or
> accrediting body. The intent of the law, in extending the homebound
> exception status to attendance at such adult day care facilities,
> recognizes that they ordinarily furnish psychosocial services.

# - Services Are Provided Under a Plan of Care Established and Approved by a Physician or Allowed Practitioner

> 01- 11-21)**

# -- Definition of an Allowed Practitioner

### (Rev. 11386, Issued: 04-27-22, Effective: 01-01-22, Implementation: 05-26-22)

> Allowed practitioners in addition to physicians, can certify and
> recertify beneficiaries for eligibility, order home health services,
> and establish and review the care plan. Allowed practitioners are
> defined at § 484.2 as a physician assistant (PA), nurse practitioner
> (NP), or clinical nurse specialist (CNS) as defined at this part. NPs,
> CNSs, and PAs are required to practice in accordance with state law in
> the state in which the individual performs such services. Physician
> assistant means an individual as defined at § 410.74(a) and
>
> (c). Clinical nurse specialist means an individual as defined at §
> 410.76(a) and (b), and who is working in collaboration with the
> physician as defined at § 410.76(c)(3). Nurse practitioner means an
> individual as defined at § 410.75(a) and (b), and who is working in
> collaboration with the physician as defined at § 410.75(c)(3).
>
> Individual states have varying requirements for conditions of
> practice, which determine whether a practitioner may work
> independently without a written collaborative agreement or supervision
> from a physician, or whether general or direct supervision and
> collaboration is required. In the absence of State law governing
> collaboration,
>
> collaboration is to be evidenced by NPs documenting their scope of

# 30.2. 2 - Content of the Plan of Care

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> The HHA must be acting upon a physician or allowed practitioner plan
> of care that meets the requirements of this section for HHA services
> to be covered. For HHA services to be covered, the individualized plan
> of care must specify the services necessary to meet the
> patient-specific needs identified in the comprehensive assessment. In
> addition, the plan of care must include the identification of the
> responsible discipline(s) and the frequency and duration of all visits
> as well as those items listed in 42 CFR 484.60(a) that establish the
> need for such services. All care provided must be in accordance with
> the plan of care.
>
> If the plan of care includes a course of treatment for therapy
> services:

-   The course of therapy treatment must be established by the physician
    or allowed practitioner after any needed consultation with the
    qualified therapist;

-   The plan must include measurable therapy treatment goals which
    pertain directly to the patient's illness or injury, and the
    patient's resultant impairments;

-   The plan must include the expected duration of therapy services; and

-   The plan must describe a course of treatment which is consistent
    with the qualified therapist's assessment of the patient's function.

    3.  # - Specificity of Orders

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01-11-21)

> The orders on the plan of care must indicate the type of services to
> be provided to the patient, both with respect to the professional who
> will provide them and the nature of the individual services, as well
> as the frequency of the services.

## EXAMPLE 1:

> SN x 7/wk x 1 wk; 3/wk x 4 wk; 2/wk x 3 wk, (skilled nursing visits 7
> times per week for 1 week; 3 times per week for 4 weeks; and 2 times
> per week for 3 weeks) for skilled observation and evaluation of the
> surgical site, for teaching sterile dressing changes and to perform
> sterile dressing changes. The sterile change consists of (detail of
> procedure).
>
> Orders for care may indicate a specific range in the frequency of
> visits to ensure that the most appropriate level of services is
> provided to home health patients under a home
>
> health plan of care. When a range of visits is ordered, the upper
> limit of the range is considered the specific frequency.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> SN x 2-4/wk x 4 wk; 1-2/wk x 4 wk for skilled observation and
> evaluation of the surgical site.
>
> Orders for services to be furnished \"as needed\" or \"PRN\" must be
> accompanied by a description of the patient\'s medical signs and
> symptoms that would occasion a visit and a specific limit on the
> number of those visits to be made under the order before an additional
> physician or allowed practitioner order would have to be obtained.

# - Who Signs the Plan of Care

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> The physician or allowed practitioner who signs the plan of care must
> be qualified to sign the certification as described in [[42 CFR
> 424.22]{.underline}.](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title42-vol3/pdf/CFR-2014-title42-vol3-sec424-22.pdf)

# - Timeliness of Signature

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

A.  **Initial Percentage Payment**

> If a physician or allowed practitioner signed plan of care is not
> available at the beginning of the 30-day period, the HHA may submit a
> RAP for the initial percentage payment based on physician or allowed
> practitioner verbal orders OR a referral prescribing detailed orders
> for the services to be rendered that is signed and dated by the
> physician or allowed practitioner. If the RAP submission is based on
> verbal orders, the verbal order must be recorded in the plan of care,
> include a description of the patient\'s condition and the services to
> be provided by the home health agency, include an attestation
> (relating to the physician\'s or allowed practitioner's orders and the
> date received per [[42 CFR
> 409.43]{.underline}](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title42-vol2/pdf/CFR-2014-title42-vol2-sec409-43.pdf)),
> and the plan of care is copied and immediately submitted to the
> physician or allowed practitioner. A billable visit must be rendered
> prior to the submission of a RAP.

### Final Percentage Payment

> The plan of care must be signed and dated by a physician or allowed
> practitioner as described who meets the certification and
> recertification requirements of [[42 CFR
> 424.22]{.underline}](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title42-vol3/pdf/CFR-2014-title42-vol3-sec424-22.pdf)
> and before the claim for each 30-day period for services is submitted
> for the final percentage payment. Any changes in the plan of care must
> be signed and dated by a physician or allowed practitioner.

# - Use of Oral (Verbal) Orders

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> When services are furnished based on a physician or allowed
> practitioner's oral order, the orders may be accepted and put in
> writing by personnel authorized to do so by applicable State and
> Federal laws and regulations as well as by the HHA\'s internal
> policies. The orders must be signed and dated with the date of receipt
> by the registered nurse or qualified therapist (i.e., physical
> therapist, speech-language pathologist, occupational therapist, or
> medical social worker) responsible for furnishing or supervising the
> ordered services. The orders may be signed by the supervising
> registered nurse or qualified therapist after the services have been
> rendered, as long as HHA personnel who receive the oral orders notify
> that nurse or therapist before the service is rendered. Thus, the
> rendering of a service that is based on an oral order would not be
> delayed pending signature of the supervising nurse or therapist. Oral
> orders must be countersigned and dated by the physician or allowed
> practitioner before the HHA bills for the care in the same way as the
> plan of care.
>
> Services which are provided from the beginning of the 60-day
> certification period based on a request for anticipated payment and
> before the physician or allowed practitioner signs the plan of care
> are considered to be provided under a plan of care established and
> approved by the physician or allowed practitioner where there is an
> oral order for the care prior to rendering the services which is
> documented in the medical record and where the services are included
> in a signed plan of care.
>
> Services that are provided in the subsequent 60-day certification
> period are considered provided under the plan of care of the
> subsequent 60-day episode where there is an oral order before the
> services provided in the subsequent period are furnished and the order
> is reflected in the medical record. However, services that are
> provided after the expiration of the plan of care, but before the
> acquisition of an oral order or a signed plan of care are not
> considered provided under a plan of care.

## EXAMPLE 1:

> The HHA acquires an oral order for I.V. medication administration for
> a patient to be performed on August 1. The HHA provides the I.V.
> medication administration August 1 and evaluates the patient\'s need
> for continued care. The physician or allowed practitioner signs the
> plan of care for the I.V. medication administration on August 15. The
> visit is covered since it is considered provided under a plan of care
> established and approved by the physician or allowed practitioner, and
> the HHA had acquired an oral order prior to the delivery of services.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> The patient is under a plan of care in which the physician or allowed
> practitioner orders
>
> I.V. medication administration every 2 weeks. The last day covered by
> the initial plan of care is July 31. The patient\'s next I.V.
> medication administration is scheduled for August 5 and the physician
> or allowed practitioner signs the plan of care for the new period on
> August 1. The I.V. medication administration on August 5 was provided
> under a plan of care established and approved by the physician or
> allowed practitioner.

## EXAMPLE 3:

> The patient is under a plan of care in which the physician or allowed
> practitioner orders
>
> I.V. medication administration every 2 weeks. The last day covered by
> the plan of care is July 31. The patient\'s next I.V. medication
> administration is scheduled for August 5 and the physician or allowed
> practitioner does not sign the plan of care until August 6. The HHA
> acquires an oral order for the I.V. medication administration before
> the August 5 visit, and therefore the visit is considered to be
> provided under a plan of care established and approved by the
> physician or allowed practitioner.
>
> Any increase in the frequency of services or addition of new services
> during a 60-day certification must be authorized by a physician or
> allowed practitioner by way of a written or oral order prior to the
> provision of the increased or additional services.

# - Alternative Signatures

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> HHAs that maintain patient records by computer rather than hard copy

> the records and a process for reconstruction of the records in the
> event of a system breakdown.

# - Termination of the Plan of Care - Qualifying Services

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> The plan of care is considered to be terminated if the patient does
> not receive at least one covered skilled nursing, physical therapy,
> speech-language pathology service, or occupational therapy visit in a
> 60-day certification period since these are qualifying services for
> the home health benefit. An exception is if the physician or allowed
> practitioner documents that the interval without such care is
> appropriate to the treatment of the patient\'s illness or injury.

# - Sequence of Qualifying Services and Other Medicare Covered Home Health Services

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> Once patient eligibility has been confirmed and the plan of care
> contains physician or allowed practitioner orders for the qualifying
> service as well as other Medicare covered home health services, the
> qualifying service does not have to be rendered prior to the other
> Medicare covered home health services ordered in the plan of care. The
> sequence of visits performed by the disciplines must be dictated by
> the individual patient\'s plan of care. For example, for an eligible
> patient in an initial 60-day certification period that has both
> physical therapy and occupational therapy orders in the plan of care,
> the sequence of the delivery of the type of therapy is irrelevant as
> long as the need for the qualifying service is established prior to

> accordance with [[42 CFR
> 409.43(f)]{.underline}.](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/)
>
> **NOTE:** Dependent services provided after the final qualifying

> Continued Need for Occupational Therapy**

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

1.  Skilled nursing care that is

    -   Reasonable and necessary as defined in
        > [[§40.1]{.underline}](#skilled-nursing-care);

    -   Needed on an \"intermittent\" basis as defined in §40.1.3; and

    -   Not solely needed for venipuncture for the purposes of obtaining
        > blood sample as defined in
        > [[§40.1.2.13]{.underline}](#venipuncture);or

2.  Physical therapy as defined in
    [[§40.2.2]{.underline}](#application-of-the-principles-to-physical-therapy-services);
    or

3.  Speech-language pathology services as defined in

    or

4.  Have a continuing need for occupational therapy as defined in
    [[§§40.2.4]{.underline}.](#application-of-the-general-principles-to-occupational-therapy)

> The patient has a continued need for occupational therapy when:

1.  The services which the patient requires meet the definition of
    \"occupational therapy\" services of
    [[§40.2](#rev.-10438-issued-11-06-20-effective-03-01-20-implementation-01--11-21-28).4]{.underline},
    and

2.  The patient\'s eligibility for home health services has been
    established by virtue of a prior need for skilled nursing care
    (other than solely venipuncture for the purposes of obtaining a
    blood sample), speech-language pathology services, or physical
    therapy in the current or prior certification period.

> **EXAMPLE:** A patient who is recovering from a cerebrovascular
> accident (CVA) has an initial plan of care that called for physical
> therapy, speech-language pathology services, occupational therapy, and
> home health aide services. In the next certification period, the
> physician or allowed practitioner orders only occupational therapy and
> home health aide services because the patient no longer needs the
> skills of a physical therapist or a speech- language pathologist, but
> needs the services provided by the occupational therapist. The
> patient\'s need for occupational therapy qualifies him for home health
> services, including home health aide services (presuming that all
> other qualifying criteria are met), because in the prior certification
> period the beneficiary's eligibility for home health services was
> established by virtue of prior needs for physical therapy and
> speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy was initiated

    or was confined to the home as defined in §30.1.1;

2.  The patient needs or needed skilled nursing services on an
    intermittent basis (other than solely venipuncture for the purposes
    of obtaining a blood sample), or physical therapy, or
    speech-language pathology services. Where a patient's sole skilled
    service need is for skilled oversight of unskilled services
    (management and evaluation of the care plan as defined in
    §40.1.2.2), the physician or allowed practitioner must include a
    brief narrative describing the clinical justification of this need
    as part of the certification, or as a signed addendum to the
    certification;

3.  A plan of care has been established and is periodically reviewed by
    a physician or allowed practitioner;

4.  The services are or were furnished while the patient is or was under
    the care of a physician or allowed practitioner;

5.  For episodes/periods with starts of care beginning January 1, 2011
    and later, in accordance with §30.5.1.1 below, a face-to-face
    encounter occurred no more than 90 days prior to or within 30 days
    after the start of the home health care, was related to the primary
    reason the patient requires home health services, and was performed
    by a physician or non-physician practitioner. The certifying
    physician or allowed practitioner must also document the date of the
    encounter.

### Example Certification Statement:

> I certify that this patient is confined to his/her home and needs
> intermittent skilled nursing care, physical therapy and/or speech
> therapy or continues to need occupational therapy. The patient is
> under my care, and I have authorized services on this plan of care and
> will periodically review the plan. The patient had a face-to-face
> encounter
>
> with a physician or an allowed non-physician practitioner on
> [11/01/2020]{.underline} and the encounter was related to the primary
> reason for home health care.
>
> Physician or allowed practitioner's Signature and Date Signed: **John
> Doe, MD 11/05/2020**
>
> Physician or Allowed Practitioner's Name and Address John Doe, MD
>
> 2121 Washington Pkwy
>
> Suite 220
>
> Washington, DC 20000
>
> **NOTE**: This represents one example of a valid certification
> statement. Certification statements can be included in varying forms
> or formats as long as the content requirements (#1-5 above) for the
> certification are met.
>
> If the patient is starting home health directly after discharge from
> an acute/post-acute care setting where the physician or allowed
> practitioner, with privileges, that cared for the patient in that
> setting is certifying the patient's eligibility for the home health
> benefit, but will not be following the patient after discharge, then
> the certifying physician or allowed practitioner must identify the
> community physician or allowed practitioner who will be following the
> patient after discharge. One of the criteria that must be met for a
> patient to be considered eligible for the home health benefit is that
> the patient must be under the care of a physician or allowed
> practitioner (number 4 listed above). Otherwise, the certification is
> not valid.
>
> The certification must be complete prior to when an HHA bills Medicare
> for reimbursement; however, physicians and allowed practitioners
> should complete the certification when the plan of care is
> established, or as soon as possible thereafter. This is longstanding
> CMS policy as referenced in Pub 100-01, Medicare General Information,

# -- Face-to-Face Encounter

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

1.  Allowed Provider Types

> As part of the certification of patient eligibility for the Medicare
> home health benefit, a face-to-face encounter with the patient must be
> performed by the certifying physician or allowed practitioner himself
> or herself, a physician or allowed practitioner that cared for the
> patient in the acute or post-acute care facility (with privileges who
> cared for the patient in an acute or post-acute care facility from
> which the patient was directly admitted to home health) or an allowed
> non-physician practitioner (NPP).
>
> NPPs who are allowed to perform the encounter are:

-   A nurse practitioner or a clinical nurse specialist working in
    accordance with State law and in collaboration with the certifying
    physician or in collaboration with an acute or post-acute care
    physician, with privileges, who cared for the patient in the acute
    or post-acute care facility from which the patient was directly
    admitted to home health;

-   A certified nurse midwife, as authorized by State law, under the
    supervision of the certifying physician or under the supervision of
    an acute or post-acute care physician with privileges who cared for
    the patient in the acute or post-acute care facility from which the
    patient was directly admitted to home health;

-   A physician assistant under the supervision of the certifying
    physician or under the supervision of an acute or post-acute care
    physician with privileges who cared for the patient in the acute or
    post-acute care facility from which the patient was directly
    admitted to home health.

> NPPs performing the encounter are subject to the same financial
> restrictions with the HHA as the certifying physician, as described in
> [[42 CFR
> 424.22(d)]{.underline}](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title42-vol3/pdf/CFR-2014-title42-vol3-sec424-22.pdf).

2.  Timeframe Requirements

    -   The encounter must occur no more than 90 days prior to the home
        health start of care date or within 30 days after the start of
        care.

    -   In situations when a physician or allowed practitioner orders
        home health care for the patient based on a new condition that
        was not evident during a visit within the 90 days prior to start
        of care, the physician or an allowed NPP must see the patient
        again within 30 days after admission. Specifically, if a patient
        saw the physician or NPP within the 90 days prior to start of
        care, another encounter would be needed if the patient's
        condition had changed to the extent that standards of practice
        would indicate that the physician or a non-physician
        practitioner should examine the patient in order to establish an
        effective treatment plan.

3.  Exceptional Circumstances

> When a home health patient dies shortly after admission, before the
> face-to-face encounter occurs, if the contractor determines a good
> faith effort existed on the part of the HHA to facilitate/coordinate
> the encounter and if all other certification requirements are met, the
> certification is deemed to be complete.

4.  Telehealth

> The face-to-face encounter can be performed via a telehealth service,
> in an approved originating site. An originating site is considered to
> be the location of an eligible
>
> Medicare beneficiary at the time the service being furnished via a
> telecommunications system occurs. Medicare beneficiaries are eligible
> for telehealth services only if they are presented from an originating
> site located in a rural health professional shortage area or in a
> county outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area.
>
> Entities that participate in a Federal telemedicine demonstration
> project approved by (or receiving funding from) the Secretary of the
> Department of Health and Human Services as of December 31, 2000,
> qualify as originating sites regardless of geographic location.
>
> The originating sites authorized by law are:

-   The office of a physician or practitioner;

-   Hospitals;

-   Critical Access Hospitals (CAH);

-   Rural Health Clinics (RHC);

-   Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC);

-   Hospital-based or CAH-based Renal Dialysis Centers (including
    satellites);

-   Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF); and

-   Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC).

    1.  # -- Supporting Documentation Requirements

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> As of January 1, 2015, documentation in the certifying physician or
> allowed practitioner's medical records and/or the acute /post-acute
> care facility's medical records (if the patient was directly admitted
> to home health) will be used as the basis upon which patient
> eligibility for the Medicare home health benefit will be determined.
>
> Documentation from the certifying physician or allowed practitioner's
> medical records and/or the acute /post-acute care facility's medical
> records (if the patient was directly admitted to home health) used to
> support the certification of home health eligibility must be provided,
> upon request, to the home health agency, review entities, and/or the
> Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In turn, an HHA must
> be able to provide, upon request, the supporting documentation that
> substantiates the eligibility for the Medicare home health benefit to
> review entities and/or CMS. If the documentation used as the basis for
> the certification of eligibility is not sufficient to demonstrate that
> the patient is or was eligible to receive services under the Medicare
> home health benefit, payment will not be rendered for home health
> services provided.
>
> The certifying physician or allowed practitioner and/or the
> acute/post-acute care facility medical record (if the patient was
> directly admitted to home health) for the patient must contain
> information that justifies the referral for Medicare home health
> services. This includes documentation that substantiates the
> patient's:

-   Need for the skilled services; and

-   Homebound status;

> The certifying physician or allowed practitioner and/or the
> acute/post-acute care facility medical record (if the patient was
> directly admitted to home health) for the patient must contain the
> actual clinical note for the face-to-face encounter visit that
> demonstrates that the encounter:

-   Occurred within the required timeframe,

-   Was related to the primary reason the patient requires home health
    services; and

-   Was performed by an allowed provider type.

> This information can be found most often in clinical and progress
> notes and discharge summaries. While the face-to-face encounter must
> be related to the primary reason for home health services, the
> patient's skilled need and homebound status can be substantiated
> through an examination of all submitted medical record documentation
> from the certifying physician or allowed practitioner,
> acute/post-acute care facility, and/or HHA (see below). The synthesis
> of progress notes, diagnostic findings, medications, nursing notes,
> etc., help to create a longitudinal clinical picture of the patient's
> health status.

-   Information from the HHA, such as the plan of care required per 42
    CFR §409.43 and the initial and/or comprehensive assessment of the
    patient required per 42 CFR §484.55, can be incorporated into the
    certifying physician or allowed practitioner's medical record for
    the patient and used to support the patient's homebound status and
    need for skilled care. However, this information must be
    corroborated by other medical record entries in the certifying
    physician or allowed practitioner's and/or the acute/post-acute care
    facility's medical record for the patient. This means that the
    appropriately incorporated HHA information, along with the
    certifying physician or allowed practitioner's and/or the
    acute/post- acute care facility's medical record, creates a
    clinically consistent picture that the patient is eligible for
    Medicare home health services.

-   The certifying physician or allowed practitioner demonstrates the
    incorporation of the HHA information into his/her medical record for
    the patient by signing and dating the material. Once incorporated,
    the documentation from the HHA, in conjunction with the certifying
    physician or allowed practitioner and/or acute/post-acute care
    facility documentation, must substantiate the patient's eligibility
    for home health services.

# - Physician or Allowed Practitioner Recertification

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> At the end of the 60-day certification, a decision must be made
> whether or not to recertify the patient for a subsequent 60-days. An
> eligible beneficiary who qualifies for a subsequent 60-day
> certification would start the subsequent 60-day certification on day
> 61. Under HH PPS, the plan of care must be reviewed and signed by the
> physician or allowed practitioner every 60 days unless one of the
> following occurs:

-   A beneficiary transfers to another HHA; or

-   A discharge and return to home health during the 60-day
    certification.

> For recertification of home health services, the physician or allowed
> practitioner must certify (attest) that:

1.  The home health services are or were needed because the patient is
    or was confined to the home as defined in §30.1;

2.  The patient needs or needed skilled nursing services on an
    intermittent basis (other than solely venipuncture for the purposes
    of obtaining a blood sample), or physical therapy, or
    speech-language pathology services; or continues to need
    occupational therapy after the need for skilled nursing care,
    physical therapy, or speech-language pathology services ceased.
    Where a patient's sole skilled service need is for skilled oversight
    of unskilled services (management and evaluation of the care plan as
    defined in §40.1.2.2), the physician or allowed practitioner must
    include a brief narrative describing the clinical justification of
    this need as part of the recertification, or as a signed addendum to
    the recertification;

3.  A plan of care has been established and is periodically reviewed by
    a physician or allowed practitioner; and

4.  The services are or were furnished while the patient is or was under
    the care of a physician or allowed practitioner.

> Medicare does not limit the number of continuous 60-day
> recertifications for beneficiaries who continue to be eligible for the
> home health benefit. The certification may cover a period less than
> but not greater than 60 days. Because the updated home health plan of
> care must include the frequency and duration of visits to be made, the
> physician or allowed practitioner does not have to estimate how much
> longer skilled services will be needed for the recertification.

# - Who May Sign the Certification or Recertification

### (Rev. 10738, Issued: 05-07-21, Effective: 01-01-21, Implementation: 08-09-21)

> The physician or allowed practitioner who signs the certification or
> recertification must be permitted to do so by 42 CFR 424.22. A
> physician or other allowed non-physician practitioner, other than the
> certifying physician or certifying allowed practitioner who
> established the home health plan of care, may sign the plan of care or
> the recertification statement in the absence of the certifying
> physician or certifying allowed practitioner. This is only permitted
> when such physician or allowed non-physician practitioner has been
> authorized to care for the certifying physician's or allowed
> practitioner's patients in his/her absence. The HHA is responsible for
> ensuring that the physician or allowed non- physician practitioner who
> signs the plan of care and recertification statement was authorized by
> the physician or allowed practitioner who established the plan of care
> and completed the certification for his/her patient in his/her
> absence. The physician or
>
> allowed practitioner that performed the required face-to-face
> encounter must sign the certification of eligibility, unless the
> patient is directly admitted to home health care from an acute or
> post-acute care facility and the encounter was performed by a
> physician or allowed practitioner in such setting.

# -- Physician or Allowed Practitioner Billing for Certification and Recertification

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> Certification and recertification claims are Part B claims paid for
> under the Physician Fee Schedule. These claims are billed using HCPCS
> codes G0180 (certification) or G0179 (re-certification). The
> descriptions of these two codes indicate that they are used to bill
> for certification or recertification of patient eligibility "for
> Medicare-covered home health services under a home health plan of care
> (patient not present), including contacts with the HHA and review of
> reports of patient status required by physicians or allowed
> practitioners to affirm the initial implementation of the plan of care
> that meets patient\'s needs, per certification period". As noted
> above, these codes are for certification or recertification for
> Medicare-covered home health services. If there are no Medicare-
> covered home health services, these codes should not be billed or
> paid. As such, claims for certification/recertification of eligibility
> for home health services (G0180 and G0179, respectively) will not be
> covered if the HHA claim itself was non-covered because the
> certification/recertification of eligibility was not complete or
> because there was insufficient documentation to support that the
> patient was eligible for the Medicare home health benefit.

# - Covered Services Under a Qualifying Home Health Plan of Care

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> [[Section

-   Part-time or intermittent skilled nursing care (other than solely
    venipuncture for the purposes of obtaining a blood sample);

-   Part-time or intermittent home health aide services;

-   Physical therapy;

-   Speech-language pathology;

-   Occupational therapy;

-   Medical social services;

-   Medical supplies (including catheters, catheter supplies, ostomy
    bags, supplies related to ostomy care, and a covered osteoporosis
    drug (as defined in
    [[§1861(kk]{.underline}](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1861.htm)
    of the Act), but excluding other drugs and biologicals);

    by physician or allowed practitioner;

-   Medical services provided by an intern or resident-in-training under
    an approved teaching program of the hospital in the case of an HHA
    which is affiliated or under common control with a hospital; and

-   Services at hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, or rehabilitation

# - General Principles Governing Reasonable and Necessary Skilled Nursing Care

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> If all other eligibility and coverage requirements under the home
> health benefit are met, skilled nursing services are covered when an
> individualized assessment of the patient's clinical condition
> demonstrates that the specialized judgment, knowledge, and skills of a
> registered nurse or, when provided by regulation, a licensed practical
> (vocational) nurse ("skilled care") are necessary. Skilled nursing
> services are covered where such skilled nursing services are necessary
> to maintain the patient's current condition or prevent or
>
> slow further deterioration so long as the beneficiary requires skilled
> care for the services to be safely and effectively provided. When,
> however, the individualized assessment does not demonstrate such a
> necessity for skilled care, including when the services needed do not
> require skilled nursing care because they could safely and effectively
> be performed by the patient or unskilled caregivers, such services
> will not be covered under the home health benefit.
>
> Skilled nursing care is necessary only when (a) the particular
> patient's special medical complications require the skills of a
> registered nurse or, when provided by regulation, a licensed practical
> nurse to perform a type of service that would otherwise be considered
> non-skilled; or (b) the needed services are of such complexity that
> the skills of a registered nurse or, when provided by regulation, a
> licensed practical nurse are required to furnish the services. To be
> considered a skilled service, the service must be so inherently
> complex that it can be safely and effectively performed only by, or
> under the supervision of, professional or technical personnel as
> provided by regulation, including 42 C.F.R. 409.32.
>
> Some services may be classified as a skilled nursing service on the
> basis of complexity alone (e.g., intravenous and intramuscular
> injections or insertion of catheters) and, if reasonable and necessary
> to the treatment of the patient\'s illness or injury, would be covered
> on that basis. If a service can be safely and effectively performed
> (or self- administered) by an unskilled person, without the direct
> supervision of a nurse, the service cannot be regarded as a skilled
> nursing service although a nurse actually provides the service.
> However, in some cases, the condition of the patient may cause a
> service that would ordinarily be considered unskilled to be considered
> a skilled nursing service. This would occur when the patient\'s
> condition is such that the service can be safely and effectively
> provided only by a nurse. A service is not considered a skilled
> nursing service merely because it is performed by or under the
> supervision of a nurse. The unavailability of a competent person to
> provide a non-skilled service, regardless of the importance of the
> service to the patient, does not make it a skilled service when a
> nurse provides the service.
>
> A service that, by its nature, requires the skills of a nurse to be
> provided safely and effectively continues to be a skilled service even
> if it is taught to the patient, the patient\'s family, or other
> caregivers.
>
> The skilled nursing service must be reasonable and necessary to the
> diagnosis and treatment of the patient\'s illness or injury within the
> context of the patient\'s unique medical condition. To be considered
> reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the
> patient\'s illness or injury, the services must be consistent with the
> nature and severity of the illness or injury, the patient\'s
> particular medical needs, and accepted standards of medical and
> nursing practice. The determination of whether the services are
> reasonable and necessary should be made in consideration that a
> physician or allowed practitioner has determined that the services
> ordered are reasonable and necessary. The services must, therefore, be
> viewed from the perspective of the condition of the patient when the
> services were ordered and what was, at that time, reasonably expected
> to be appropriate treatment for the illness or injury throughout the
> certification period.
>
> A patient\'s overall medical condition, without regard to whether the
> illness or injury is acute, chronic, terminal, or expected to extend
> over a long period of time, should be considered in deciding whether
> skilled services are needed. A patient\'s diagnosis should never be
> the sole factor in deciding that a service the patient needs is either
> skilled or not skilled. Skilled care may, depending on the unique
> condition of the patient, continue to be necessary for patients whose
> condition is stable.
>
> As is outlined in home health regulations, as part of the home health
> agency (HHA) Conditions of Participation (CoPs), the clinical record
> of the patient must contain progress and clinical notes. Additionally,
> in Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 10; "Home
> Health Agency Billing", instructions specify that for each claim, HHAs
> are required to report all services provided to the beneficiary during
> each 30-day period, which includes reporting each visit in line-item
> detail. As such, it is expected that the home health records for every
> visit will reflect the need for the skilled medical care provided.
> These clinical notes are also expected to provide important
> communication among all members of the home care team regarding the
> development, course and outcomes of the skilled observations,
> assessments, treatment and training performed. Taken as a whole then,
> the clinical notes are expected to tell the story of the patient's
> achievement towards his/her goals as outlined in the Plan of Care. In
> this way, the notes will serve to demonstrate why a skilled service is
> needed.
>
> Therefore the home health clinical notes must document as appropriate:

-   the history and physical exam pertinent to the day's visit,
    (including the response or changes in behavior to previously
    administered skilled services) and the skilled services applied on
    the current visit, and

-   the patient/caregiver's response to the skilled services provided,
    and

-   the plan for the next visit based on the rationale of prior results,

-   a detailed rationale that explains the need for the skilled service
    in light of the patient's overall medical condition and experiences,

-   the complexity of the service to be performed, and

-   any other pertinent characteristics of the beneficiary or home

> Clinical notes should be written so that they adequately describe the
> reaction of a patient to his/her skilled care. Clinical notes should
> also provide a clear picture of the treatment, as well as "next steps"
> to be taken. Vague or subjective descriptions of the patient's care
> should not be used. For example, terminology such as the following
> would not adequately describe the need for skilled care:

-   Patient tolerated treatment well

-   Caregiver instructed in medication management

-   Continue with POC

> Objective measurements of physical outcomes of treatment should be
> provided and/or a clear description of the changed behaviors due to
> education programs should be recorded in order that all concerned can
> follow the results of the applied services.

## EXAMPLE 1:

> The presence of a plaster cast on an extremity generally does not
> indicate a need for skilled nursing care. However, the patient with a
> preexisting peripheral vascular or circulatory condition might need
> skilled nursing care to observe for complications, monitor medication
> administration for pain control, and teach proper skin care to
> preserve skin integrity and prevent breakdown. The documentation must
> support the severity of the circulatory condition that requires
> skilled care. The clinical notes for each home health visit should
> document the patient's skin and circulatory examination as well as the
> patient and/or caregiver application of the educational principles
> taught since the last visit. The plan for the next visit should
> describe the skilled services continuing to be required.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> The condition of a patient, who has irritable bowel syndrome or is
> recovering from rectal surgery, may be such that he or she can be
> given an enema safely and effectively only by a nurse. If the enema
> were necessary to treat the illness or injury, then the visit would be
> covered as a skilled nursing visit. The documentation must support the
> skilled need for the enema, and the plan for future visits based on
> this information.

## EXAMPLE 3:

> Giving a bath does not ordinarily require the skills of a nurse and,
> therefore, would not be covered as a skilled nursing service unless
> the patient\'s condition is such that the bath could be given safely
> and effectively only by a nurse (as discussed in
> [[§30.1]{.underline}](#conditions-patient-must-meet-to-qualify-for-coverage-of-home-health-services)
> above).

## EXAMPLE 4:

> A patient with a well-established colostomy absent complications may
> require assistance changing the colostomy bag because they cannot do
> it themselves and there is no one else to change the bag.
> Notwithstanding the need for the routine colostomy care, changing the
> colostomy bag does not become a skilled nursing service when the nurse
> provides it.

## EXAMPLE 5:

> A patient was discharged from the hospital with an open draining wound
> that requires irrigation, packing, and dressing twice each day. The
> HHA has taught the family to perform the dressing changes. The HHA
> continues to see the patient for the wound care that is needed during
> the time that the family is not available and willing to provide the
> dressing changes. The wound care continues to be skilled nursing care,
> notwithstanding
>
> that the family provides it part of the time, and may be covered as
> long as the patient requires it.

## EXAMPLE 6:

> A physician has ordered skilled nursing visits for a patient with a
> hairline fracture of the hip. The home health record must document the
> reason skilled services are required and why the nursing visits are
> reasonable and necessary for treatment of the patient\'s hip injury.

## EXAMPLE 7:

> A physician has ordered skilled nursing visits for teaching of
> self-administration and self- management of the medication regimen for
> a patient, newly diagnosed, with diabetes mellitus in the home health
> plan of care. Each visit's documentation must describe the patient's
> progress in this activity.

## EXAMPLE 8:

> Following a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), a patient has an
> in-dwelling Foley catheter because of urinary incontinence, and is
> expected to require the catheter for a long and indefinite period. The
> medical condition of the patient must be described and documented to
> support the need for nursing skilled services in the home health plan
> of care. Periodic visits to change the catheter as needed, treat the
> symptoms of catheter malfunction, and teach proper catheter care would
> be covered as long as they are reasonable and necessary, although the
> patient is stable, even if there is an expectation that the care will
> be needed for a long and indefinite period. However, at every home
> health visit, the patient's current medical condition must be
> described and there must be documentation to support the need for
> continued skilled nursing services.

## EXAMPLE 9:

> A patient with advanced multiple sclerosis undergoing an exacerbation
> of the illness needs skilled teaching of medications, measures to
> overcome urinary retention, and the establishment of a program
> designed to minimize the adverse impact of the exacerbation. The
> clinical notes for each home health visit must describe why skilled
> nursing services were required. The skilled nursing care received by
> the patient would be covered despite the chronic nature of the
> illness.

## EXAMPLE 10:

> A patient with malignant melanoma is terminally ill, and requires
> skilled observation, assessment, teaching, and treatment. The patient
> has not elected coverage under Medicare\'s hospice benefit. The
> documentation should describe the goal of the skilled nursing
> intervention, and at each visit the services provided should support
> that goal. The skilled nursing care that the patient requires would be
> covered, notwithstanding that the
>
> condition is terminal, because the documentation and description must
> support that the needed services required the skills of a nurse.

# - Application of the Principles to Skilled Nursing Services

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

## A3-3118.1.B, HHA-205.1.B

> The following discussion of skilled nursing services applies the
> foregoing principles to specific skilled nursing services about which
> questions are most frequently raised.

# - Observation and Assessment of the Patient\'s Condition When Only the Specialized Skills of a Medical Professional Can Determine Patient\'s Status

### (Rev. 265, Issued: 01-10-20, Effective: 01-01-20, Implementation: 02-11-20)

> Observation and assessment of the patient\'s condition by a nurse are
> reasonable and necessary skilled services where there is a reasonable
> potential for change in a patient\'s condition that requires skilled
> nursing personnel to identify and evaluate the patient\'s need for
> possible modification of treatment or initiation of additional medical
> procedures until the patient\'s clinical condition and/or treatment
> regimen has stabilized. Where a patient was admitted to home health
> care for skilled observation because there was a reasonable potential
> of a complication or further acute episode, but did not develop a
> further acute episode or complication, the skilled observation
> services are still covered for 3 weeks or so long as there remains a
> reasonable potential for such a complication or further acute episode.
>
> Information from the patient\'s home health record must document the
> rationale that demonstrates that there is a reasonable potential for a
> future complication or acute episode and, therefore, may justify the
> need for continued skilled observation and assessment beyond the
> 3-week period. Such signs and symptoms as abnormal/fluctuating vital
> signs, weight changes, edema, symptoms of drug toxicity,
> abnormal/fluctuating lab values, and respiratory changes on
> auscultation may justify skilled observation and assessment. Where
> these signs and symptoms are such that there is a reasonable potential
> that skilled observation and assessment by a licensed nurse will
> result in changes to the treatment of the patient, then the services
> would be covered. However, observation and assessment by a nurse is
> not reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the illness or
> injury where fluctuating signs and symptoms are part of a longstanding
> pattern of the patient\'s condition which has not previously required
> a change in the prescribed treatment.

## EXAMPLE 1:

> A patient with atherosclerotic heart disease with congestive heart
> failure requires observation by skilled nursing personnel for signs of
> decompensation or adverse effects resulting from newly prescribed
> medication. Skilled observation is needed to determine whether the new
> drug regimen should be modified or whether other therapeutic measures
>
> should be considered until the patient\'s clinical condition and/or
> treatment regimen has stabilized. The clinical notes for each home
> health visit should reflect the deliberations and their outcome.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> A patient has undergone peripheral vascular disease treatment
> including a revascularization procedure (bypass). The incision area is
> showing signs of potential infection, (e.g., heat, redness, swelling,
> drainage) and the patient has elevated body temperature. For each home
> health visit, the clinical notes must demonstrate that the skilled
> observation and monitoring is required.

## EXAMPLE 3:

> A patient was hospitalized following a heart attack. Following
> treatment he was discharged home. Because it is not known whether
> increasing exertion will exacerbate the heart disease, skilled
> observation is reasonable and necessary as mobilization is initiated
> in the patient's home. The patient's necessity for skilled observation
> must be documented at each home health visit until the patient\'s
> clinical condition and/or treatment regimen has stabilized.

## EXAMPLE 4:

> A frail 85-year old man was hospitalized for pneumonia. The infection
> was resolved, but the patient, who had previously maintained adequate
> nutrition, will not eat or eats poorly. The patient is discharged to
> the HHA for monitoring of fluid and nutrient intake and assessment of
> the need for tube feeding. Observation and monitoring by skilled
> nurses of the patient\'s oral intake, output and hydration status is
> required to determine what further treatment or other intervention is
> needed. The patient's necessity for skilled observation and treatment
> must be documented at each home health visit, until the patient\'s
> clinical condition and/or treatment regimen has stabilized.

## EXAMPLE 5:

> A patient with glaucoma and a cardiac condition has a cataract
> extraction. Because of the interaction between the eye drops for the
> glaucoma and cataracts and the beta-blocker for the cardiac condition,
> the patient is at risk for serious cardiac arrhythmia. Skilled
> observation and monitoring of the drug actions is reasonable and
> necessary until the patient\'s condition is stabilized. The patient's
> necessity for skilled observation must be documented at each home
> health visit, until the clinical condition and/or patient\'s treatment
> regimen has stabilized.

## EXAMPLE 6:

> A patient with hypertension suffered dizziness and weakness. The
> physician found that the blood pressure was too low and discontinued
> the hypertension medication. Skilled
>
> observation and monitoring of the patient\'s blood pressure and
> medication regimen is required until the blood pressure remains stable
> and in a safe range. The patient's necessity for skilled observation
> must be documented at each home health visit, until the patient\'s
> clinical condition and/or treatment regimen has stabilized.

## EXAMPLE 7:

> A patient has chronic non-healing skin ulcers, Diabetes Mellitus Type
> I, and spinal muscular atrophy. In the past, the patient's wounds have
> deteriorated, requiring the patient to be hospitalized. Previously, a
> skilled nurse has trained the patient's wife to perform wound care.
> The treating physician orders a continuation of skilled care for a
> subsequent 60-day certification period, at a frequency of one visit
> every 2 weeks to perform observation and assessment of the patient's
> skin ulcers to make certain that they are not worsening. This order is
> reasonable and necessary because, although the unskilled family
> caregiver has learned to care for the wounds, the skilled nurse can
> use observation and assessment to determine if the condition is
> worsening.

# - Management and Evaluation of a Patient Care Plan

### (Rev. 265, Issued: 01-10-20, Effective: 01-01-20, Implementation: 02-11-20)

> Skilled nursing visits for management and evaluation of the patient\'s
> care plan are also reasonable and necessary where underlying
> conditions or complications require that only a registered nurse can
> ensure that essential unskilled care is achieving its purpose. For
> skilled nursing care to be reasonable and necessary for management and
> evaluation of the patient\'s plan of care, the complexity of the
> necessary unskilled services that are a necessary part of the medical
> treatment must require the involvement of skilled nursing personnel to
> promote the patient\'s recovery and medical safety in view of the
> patient\'s overall condition.

## EXAMPLE 1:

> An aged patient with a history of diabetes mellitus and angina
> pectoris is recovering from an open reduction of the neck of the
> femur. He requires, among other services, careful skin care,
> appropriate oral medications, a diabetic diet, a therapeutic exercise
> program to preserve muscle tone and body condition, and observation to
> notice signs of deterioration in his condition or complications
> resulting from his restricted, but increasing mobility.
>
> Although a properly instructed person could perform any of the
> required services, that person would not have the capability to
> understand the relationship among the services and their effect on
> each other. Since the combination of the patient\'s condition, age,
> and immobility create a high potential for serious complications, such
> an understanding is essential to ensure the patient\'s recovery and
> safety. The management of this plan of care requires skilled nursing
> personnel until nursing visits are not needed to observe and assess
> the effects of the non-skilled services being provided to treat the
> illness or injury until the patient recovers. Where nursing visits are
> not needed to observe and assess the effects of the non-skilled
> services being provided to treat the illness or injury, skilled
> nursing care would not be considered reasonable and necessary, and the
> management and evaluation of the care plan would not be considered a
> skilled service.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> An aged patient with a history of mild dementia is recovering from
> pneumonia which has been treated at home. The patient has had an
> increase in disorientation, has residual chest congestion, decreased
> appetite, and has remained in bed, immobile, throughout the period
> with pneumonia. While the residual chest congestion and recovery from
> pneumonia alone would not represent a high risk factor, the patient\'s
> immobility and increase in confusion could create a high probability
> of a relapse. In this situation, skilled oversight of the unskilled
> services would be reasonable and necessary pending the elimination of
> the chest congestion and resolution of the persistent disorientation
> to ensure the patient\'s medical safety. For this determination to be
> made, the home health documentation must describe the complexity of
> the unskilled services that are a necessary part of the medical
> treatment and which require the involvement of a registered nurse in
> order to ensure that essential unskilled care is achieving its
> purpose. Where visits by a licensed nurse are not needed to observe
> and assess the effects of the unskilled services being provided to
> treat the illness or injury, skilled nursing care would not be
> considered reasonable and necessary to treat the illness or injury.

## EXAMPLE 3:

> A physician orders one skilled nursing visit every 2 weeks and three
> home health aide visits each week for bathing and washing hair for a
> patient whose recovery from a CVA has left him with residual weakness
> on the left side. The cardiovascular condition is stable and the
> patient has reached the maximum restoration potential. There are no
> underlying conditions that would necessitate the skilled supervision
> of a licensed nurse in assisting with bathing or hair washing. The
> skilled nursing visits are not necessary to manage and supervise the
> home health aide services and would not be covered.

# - Teaching and Training Activities

### (Rev. 179, Issued: 01-14-14, Effective: 01-07-14, Implementation: 01-07-14) A3-3118.1.B.3, HHA-205.1.B.3

> Teaching and training activities that require skilled nursing
> personnel to teach a patient, the patient\'s family, or caregivers how
> to manage the treatment regimen would constitute skilled nursing
> services. Where the teaching or training is reasonable and necessary
> to the treatment of the illness or injury, skilled nursing visits for
> teaching would be covered. The test of whether a nursing service is
> skilled relates to the skill required to teach and not to the nature
> of what is being taught. Therefore, where skilled nursing services are
> necessary to teach an unskilled service, the teaching may be covered.
> Skilled nursing visits for teaching and training activities are
> reasonable and necessary where the teaching or training is appropriate
> to the patient\'s functional loss, illness, or injury.
>
> Where it becomes apparent after a reasonable period of time that the
> patient, family, or caregiver will not or is not able to be trained,
> then further teaching and training would cease to be reasonable and
> necessary. **The reason why the training was unsuccessful should be
> documented in the record.** Notwithstanding that the teaching or
> training was
>
> unsuccessful, the services for teaching and training would be
> considered to be reasonable and necessary prior to the point that it
> became apparent that the teaching or training was unsuccessful, as
> long as such services were appropriate to the patient\'s illness,
> functional loss, or injury.
>
> In determining the reasonable and necessary number of teaching and
> training visits, consideration must be given to whether the teaching
> and training provided constitutes reinforcement of teaching provided
> previously in an institutional setting or in the home or whether it
> represents initial instruction. Where the teaching represents initial
> instruction, the complexity of the activity to be taught and the
> unique abilities of the patient are to be considered. Where the
> teaching constitutes reinforcement, an analysis of the patient\'s
> retained knowledge and anticipated learning progress is necessary to
> determine the appropriate number of visits. Skills taught in a
> controlled institutional setting often need to be reinforced when the
> patient returns home. Where the patient needs reinforcement of the
> institutional teaching, additional teaching visits in the home are
> covered.
>
> Re-teaching or retraining for an appropriate period may be considered
> reasonable and necessary where there is a change in the procedure or
> the patient\'s condition that requires re-teaching, or where the
> patient, family, or caregiver is not properly carrying out the task.
> The medical record should document the reason that the re-teaching or
> retraining is required and the patient/caregiver response to the
> education.

## EXAMPLE 1:

> A physician has ordered skilled nursing care for teaching a diabetic
> who has recently become insulin dependent. The physician has ordered
> teaching of self-injection and management of insulin, signs, and
> symptoms of insulin shock, and actions to take in emergencies. The
> education is reasonable and necessary to the treatment of the illness
> or injury, and the teaching services and the patient/caregiver
> responses must be documented.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> A physician has ordered skilled nursing care to teach a patient to
> follow a new medication regimen in which there is a significant
> probability of adverse drug reactions due to the nature of the drug
> and the patient\'s condition, to recognize signs and symptoms of
> adverse reactions to new medications, and to follow the necessary
> dietary restrictions. After it becomes apparent that the patient
> remains unable to take the medications properly, cannot demonstrate
> awareness of potential adverse reactions, and is not following the
> necessary dietary restrictions, skilled nursing care for further
> teaching would not be reasonable and necessary, since the patient has
> demonstrated an inability to be taught. The documentation must
> thoroughly describe all efforts that have been made to educate the
> patient/caregiver, and their responses. The health record should also
> describe the reason for the failure of the educational attempts.

## EXAMPLE 3:

> A physician has ordered skilled nursing visits to teach
> self-administration of insulin to a patient who has been
> self-injecting insulin for 10 years and there is no change in the
> patient\'s physical or mental status that would require re-teaching.
> The skilled nursing visits would not be considered reasonable and
> necessary since the patient has a longstanding history of being able
> to perform the service.

## EXAMPLE 4:

> A physician has ordered skilled nursing visits to teach
> self-administration of insulin to a patient who has been
> self-injecting insulin for 10 years because the patient has recently
> lost the use of the dominant hand and must be retrained to use the
> other hand. Skilled nursing visits to re-teach self-administration of
> the insulin would be reasonable and necessary. The patient's response
> to teaching must be documented at each home health visit, until the
> patient has learned how to self-administer.

## EXAMPLE 5:

> A patient recovering from pneumonia is being sent home requiring I.V.
> infusion of antibiotics four times per day. The patient\'s spouse has
> been shown how to administer the drug during the hospitalization and
> has been told the signs and symptoms of infection. The physician has
> ordered home health services for a nurse to teach the administration
> of the drug and the signs and symptoms requiring immediate medical
> attention.

## EXAMPLE 6:

> A spouse who has been taught to perform a dressing change for a
> post-surgical patient may need to be re-taught wound care if the
> spouse demonstrates improper performance of wound care. The medical
> record should document the reason that the re-teaching or retraining
> is required and the patient/caregiver response to the education.
>
> **NOTE:** There is no requirement that the patient, family or other
> caregiver be taught to provide a service if they cannot or choose not
> to provide the care.
>
> Teaching and training activities that require the skills of a licensed
> nurse include, but **are not limited to**, the following:

1.  Teaching the self-administration of injectable medications, or a
    complex range of medications;

2.  Teaching a newly diagnosed diabetic or caregiver all aspects of
    diabetes management, including how to prepare and to administer
    insulin injections, to prepare and follow a diabetic diet, to
    observe foot-care precautions, and to observe for and understand
    signs of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia;

3.  Teaching self-administration of medical gases;

4.  Teaching wound care where the complexity of the wound, the overall
    condition of the patient or the ability of the caregiver makes
    teaching necessary;

5.  Teaching care for a recent ostomy or where reinforcement of ostomy
    care is needed;

6.  Teaching self-catheterization;

7.  Teaching self-administration of gastrostomy or enteral feedings;

8.  Teaching care for and maintenance of peripheral and central venous
    lines and administration of intravenous medications through such
    lines;

9.  Teaching bowel or bladder training when bowel or bladder dysfunction
    exists;

10. Teaching how to perform the activities of daily living when the
    patient or caregiver must use special techniques and adaptive
    devices due to a loss of function;

11. Teaching transfer techniques, e.g., from bed to chair, that are
    needed for safe transfer;

12. Teaching proper body alignment and positioning, and timing
    techniques of a bed-bound patient;

13. Teaching ambulation with prescribed assistive devices (such as
    crutches, walker, cane, etc.) that are needed due to a recent
    functional loss;

14. Teaching prosthesis care and gait training;

15. Teaching the use and care of braces, splints and orthotics and
    associated skin care;

16. Teaching the preparation and maintenance of a therapeutic diet; and

17. Teaching proper administration of oral medication, including signs
    of side- effects and avoidance of interaction with other medications
    and food.

18. Teaching the proper care and application of any special dressings or
    skin treatments, (for example, dressings or treatments needed by
    patients with severe or widespread fungal infections, active and
    severe psoriasis or eczema, or due to skin deterioration due to
    radiation treatments)

# - Administration of Medications

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

## A3-3118.1.B.4, HHA-205.1.B.4

> Although drugs and biologicals are specifically excluded from coverage
> by the statute
> ([[§1861(m)(5)]{.underline}](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1861.htm)
> of the Act, the services of a nurse that are required to administer
> the medications safely and effectively may be covered if they are
> reasonable and necessary to the treatment of the illness or injury.

### Injections

> Intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injections and infusions,
> and hypodermoclysis or intravenous feedings require the skills of a
> licensed nurse to be performed (or taught) safely and effectively.
> Where these services are reasonable and necessary to treat the illness
> or injury, they may be covered. For these services to be reasonable
> and necessary, the medication being administered must be accepted as
> safe and effective treatment of the patient\'s illness or injury, and
> there must be a medical reason that the medication cannot be taken
> orally. Moreover, the frequency and duration of the administration of
> the medication must be within accepted standards of medical practice,
> or there must be a valid explanation regarding the extenuating
> circumstances to justify the need for the additional injections.

1.  Vitamin B-12 injections are considered specific therapy only for the
    following conditions:

    -   Specified anemias: pernicious anemia, megaloblastic anemias,
        > macrocytic anemias, fish tapeworm anemia;

    -   Specified gastrointestinal disorders: gastrectomy, malabsorption
        > syndromes such as sprue and idiopathic steatorrhea, surgical
        > and mechanical disorders such as resection of the small
        > intestine, strictures, anastomosis and blind loop syndrome,
        > and

    -   Certain neuropathies: posterolateral sclerosis, other
        > neuropathies associated with pernicious anemia, during the
        > acute phase or acute exacerbation of a neuropathy due to
        > malnutrition and alcoholism.

> For a patient with pernicious anemia caused by a B-12 deficiency,
> intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of vitamin B-12 at a dose of
> from 100 to 1000 micrograms no more frequently than once monthly is
> the accepted reasonable and necessary dosage schedule for maintenance
> treatment. More frequent injections would be appropriate in the
> initial or acute phase of the disease until it has been determined
> through laboratory tests that the patient can be sustained on a
> maintenance dose.

2.  Insulin Injections

> Insulin is customarily self-injected by patients or is injected by
> their families. However, where a patient is either physically or
> mentally unable to self-inject insulin and there is no other person
> who is able and willing to inject the patient, the injections would be
> considered a reasonable and necessary skilled nursing service.
>
> **EXAMPLE:** A patient who requires an injection of insulin once per
> day for treatment of diabetes mellitus, also has multiple sclerosis
> with loss of muscle control in the arms and hands, occasional tremors,
> and vision loss that causes inability to fill syringes or self- inject
> insulin. If there weren\'t an able and willing caregiver to inject her
> insulin, skilled nursing care would be reasonable and necessary for
> the injection of the insulin.
>
> The prefilling of syringes with insulin (or other medication that is
> self-injected) does not require the skills of a licensed nurse and,
> therefore, is not considered to be a skilled nursing service. If the
> patient needs someone only to prefill syringes (and therefore needs no
> skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis, physical therapy, or
> speech- language pathology services), the patient, therefore, does not
> qualify for any Medicare coverage of home health care. Prefilling of
> syringes for self-administration of insulin or other medications is
> considered to be assistance with medications that are ordinarily self-
> administered and is an appropriate home health aide service. (See
> [[§50.2]{.underline}.](#home-health-aide-services)) However, where
> State law requires that a licensed nurse prefill syringes, a skilled
> nursing visit to prefill syringes is paid as a skilled nursing visit
> (if the patient otherwise needs skilled nursing care, physical
> therapy, or speech-language pathology services), but is not considered
> to be a skilled nursing service.

### Oral Medications

> The administration of oral medications by a nurse is not reasonable
> and necessary skilled nursing care except in the specific situation in
> which the complexity of the patient\'s condition, the nature of the
> drugs prescribed, and the number of drugs prescribed require the
> skills of a licensed nurse to detect and evaluate side effects or
> reactions. The medical record must document the specific circumstances
> that cause administration of an oral medication to require skilled
> observation and assessment.

### Eye Drops and Topical Ointments

> The administration of eye drops and topical ointments does not require
> the skills of a nurse. Therefore, even if the administration of eye
> drops or ointments is necessary to the treatment of an illness or
> injury and the patient cannot self-administer the drops, and there is
> no one available to administer them, the visits cannot be covered as a
> skilled nursing service. This section does not eliminate coverage for
> skilled nursing visits for observation and assessment of the
> patient\'s condition. (See
> [[§40.2.1]{.underline}](#general-principles-governing-reasonable-and-necessary-physical-therapy-speech-language-pathology-services-and-occupational-therapy).)

## EXAMPLE 1:

> A physician has ordered skilled nursing visits to administer eye drops
> and ointments for a patient with glaucoma. The administration of eye
> drops and ointments does not require the skills of a nurse. Therefore,
> the skilled nursing visits cannot be covered as skilled nursing care,
> notwithstanding the importance of the administration of the drops as
> ordered.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> A physician has ordered skilled nursing visits for a patient with a
> reddened area under the breast. The physician instructs the patient to
> wash, rinse, and dry the area daily and apply vitamin A and D
> ointment. Skilled nursing care is not needed to provide this treatment
> and related services safely and effectively.

# - Tube Feedings

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

## A3-3118.1.B.5, HHA-205.1.B.5

> Nasogastric tube, and percutaneous tube feedings (including
> gastrostomy and jejunostomy tubes), and replacement, adjustment,
> stabilization. and suctioning of the tubes are skilled nursing
> services, and if the feedings are required to treat the patient\'s
> illness or injury, the feedings and replacement or adjustment of the
> tubes would be covered as skilled nursing services.

# - Nasopharyngeal and Tracheostomy Aspiration

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

## A3-4118.1.B.6, HHA-205.1.B.6

> Nasopharyngeal and tracheostomy aspiration are skilled nursing
> services and, if required to treat the patient\'s illness or injury,
> would be covered as skilled nursing services.

# - Catheters

### (Rev. 179, Issued: 01-14-14, Effective: 01-07-14, Implementation: 01-07-14) A3-3118.1.B.7, HHA-205.1.B.7

> Insertion and sterile irrigation and replacement of catheters, care of
> a suprapubic catheter, and in selected patients, urethral catheters,
> are considered to be skilled nursing services. Where the catheter is
> necessitated by a permanent or temporary loss of bladder control,
> skilled nursing services that are provided at a frequency appropriate
> to the type of catheter in use would be considered reasonable and
> necessary. Absent complications, Foley catheters generally require
> skilled care once approximately every 30 days and silicone catheters
> generally require skilled care once every 60-90 days and this
> frequency of service would be considered reasonable and necessary.
> However, where there are complications that require more frequent
> skilled care related to the catheter, such care would, with adequate
> documentation, be covered.
>
> **EXAMPLE:** A patient who has a Foley catheter due to loss of bladder
> control because of multiple sclerosis has a history of frequent
> plugging of the catheter and urinary tract infections. The physician
> has ordered skilled nursing visits once per month to change the
> catheter, and has left a \"PRN\" order for up to three additional
> visits per month for skilled observation and evaluation and/or
> catheter changes if the patient or caregiver reports signs and
> symptoms of a urinary tract infection or a plugged catheter. During
> the certification period, the patient\'s family contacts the HHA
> because the patient has an elevated temperature, abdominal pain, and
> scant urine output. The nurse visits the patient and determines that
> the catheter is plugged and there are symptoms of a urinary tract
>
> infection. The nurse changes the catheter and contacts the physician
> to report findings and discuss treatment. The skilled nursing visit to
> change the catheter and to evaluate the patient would be reasonable
> and necessary to the treatment of the illness or injury. The need for
> the skilled services must be documented.

# - Wound Care

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> Care of wounds, (including, but not limited to, ulcers, burns,
> pressure sores, open surgical sites, fistulas, tube sites, and tumor
> erosion sites) when the skills of a licensed nurse are needed to
> provide safely and effectively the services necessary to treat the
> illness or injury, is considered to be a skilled nursing service. For
> skilled nursing care to be reasonable and necessary to treat a wound,
> the size, depth, nature of drainage (color, odor, consistency, and
> quantity), and condition and appearance of the skin surrounding the
> wound must be documented in the clinical findings so that an
> assessment of the need for skilled nursing care can be made. This
> includes whether wound care is performed via dressing changes, NPWT
> using conventional DME systems or NPWT using a disposable device.
> Coverage or denial of skilled nursing visits for wound care may not be
> based solely on the stage classification of the wound, but rather must
> be based on all of the documented clinical findings. Moreover, the
> plan of care must contain the specific instructions for the treatment
> of the wound. Where the physician or allowed practitioner has ordered
> appropriate active treatment (e.g., sterile or complex dressings,
> NPWT, administration of prescription medications, etc.) of wounds with
> the following characteristics, the skills of a licensed nurse are
> usually reasonable and necessary:

-   Open wounds which are draining purulent or colored exudate or have a
    foul odor present or for which the patient is receiving antibiotic
    therapy;

-   Wounds with a drain or T-tube that require shortening or movement of
    such drains;

-   Wounds which require irrigation or instillation of a sterile
    cleansing or medicated solution into several layers of tissue and
    skin and/or packing with sterile gauze;

-   Recently debrided ulcers;

-   Pressure sores (decubitus ulcers) with the following
    characteristics:

    -   There is partial tissue loss with signs of infection such as
        > foul odor or purulent drainage; or

    -   There is full thickness tissue loss that involves exposure of
        > fat or invasion of other tissue such as muscle or bone.

> **NOTE:** Wounds or ulcers that show redness, edema, and induration,
> at times with epidermal blistering or desquamation do not ordinarily
> require skilled nursing care.

-   Wounds with exposed internal vessels or a mass that may have a
    proclivity for hemorrhage when a dressing is changed (e.g., post
    radical neck surgery, cancer of the vulva);

-   Open wounds or widespread skin complications following radiation
    therapy, or which result from immune deficiencies or vascular
    insufficiencies;

-   Post-operative wounds where there are complications such as
    infection or allergic reaction or where there is an underlying
    disease that has a reasonable potential to adversely affect healing
    (e.g., diabetes);

-   Third degree burns, and second degree burns where the size of the
    burn or presence of complications causes skilled nursing care to be
    needed;

-   Skin conditions that require application of nitrogen mustard or
    other chemotherapeutic medication that present a significant risk to
    the patient;

-   Other open or complex wounds that require treatment that can only be
    provided safely and effectively by a licensed nurse.

## EXAMPLE 1:

> A patient has a second-degree burn with full thickness skin damage on
> the back. The wound is cleansed, followed by an application of
> Sulfamylon. While the wound requires skilled monitoring for signs and
> symptoms of infection or complications, the dressing change requires
> skilled nursing services. The home health record at each visit must
> document the need for the skilled nursing services.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> A patient experiences a decubitus ulcer where the full thickness
> tissue loss extends through the dermis to involve subcutaneous tissue.
> The wound involves necrotic tissue with a physician\'s order to apply
> a covering of a debriding ointment following vigorous irrigation. The
> wound is then packed loosely with wet to dry dressings or continuous
> moist dressing and covered with dry sterile gauze. Skilled nursing
> care is necessary for proper treatment. The home health record at each
> visit must document the need for the skilled nursing services.
>
> **NOTE:** This section relates to the direct, hands on skilled nursing
> care provided to patients with wounds, including any necessary
> dressing changes on those wounds. While a wound might not require this

> 1998.
>
> For venipuncture to be reasonable and necessary:

1.  The physician or allowed practitioner order for the venipuncture for
    a laboratory test should be associated with a specific symptom or
    diagnosis, or the documentation should clarify the need for the test
    when it is not diagnosis/illness specific. In addition, the
    treatment must be recognized (in the Physician\'s Desk Reference, or
    other authoritative source) as being reasonable and necessary to the
    treatment of the illness or injury for venipuncture and monitoring
    the treatment must also be reasonable and necessary.

2.  The frequency of testing should be consistent with accepted
    standards of medical practice for continued monitoring of a
    diagnosis, medical problem, or treatment regimen. Even where the
    laboratory results are consistently stable, periodic venipuncture
    may be reasonable and necessary because of the nature of the
    treatment.

3.  The home health record must document the rationale for the blood
    draw as well as the results.

> Examples of reasonable and necessary venipuncture for stabilized
> patients include, but are not limited to those described below.

a.  Captopril may cause side effects such as leukopenia and
    > agranulocytosis and it is standard medical practice to monitor the
    > white blood cell count and differential count on a routine basis
    > (every 3 months) when the results are stable and the patient is
    > asymptomatic.

b.  In monitoring phenytoin (e.g., Dilantin) administration, the
    > difference between a therapeutic and a toxic level of phenytoin in
    > the blood is very slight and it is therefore appropriate to
    > monitor the level on a routine basis (every 3 months) when the
    > results are stable and the patient is asymptomatic.

c.  Venipuncture for fasting blood sugar (FBS)

    -   An unstable insulin dependent or noninsulin dependent diabetic
        > would require FBS more frequently than once per month if
        > ordered by the physician or allowed practitioner.

    -   Where there is a new diagnosis or where there has been a recent
        > exacerbation, but the patient is not unstable, monitoring once
        > per month would be reasonable and necessary.

    -   A stable insulin or noninsulin dependent diabetic would require
        > monitoring every 2-3 months.

d.  Venipuncture for prothrombin

    -   Where the documentation shows that the dosage is being adjusted,
        > monitoring would be reasonable and necessary as ordered by the
        > physician or allowed practitioner.

    -   Where the results are stable within the therapeutic ranges,
        > monthly monitoring would be reasonable and necessary.

    -   Where the results remain within nontherapeutic ranges, there
        > must be specific documentation of the factors that indicate
        > why continued monitoring is reasonable and necessary.

> **EXAMPLE:** A patient with coronary artery disease was hospitalized
> with atrial fibrillation and subsequently discharged to the HHA with
> orders for anticoagulation therapy as well as other skilled nursing
> care. If indicated, monthly venipuncture to report prothrombin
> (protime) levels to the physician or allowed practitioner would be
> reasonable and necessary even though the patient\'s prothrombin time
> tests indicate essential stability. The home health record must
> document the rationale for the blood draw as well as the results.

# - Student Nurse Visits

### (Rev. 179, Issued: 01-14-14, Effective: 01-07-14, Implementation: 01-07-14) A3-3118.1.B.14, HHA-205.1.B.14

> Visits made by a student nurse may be covered as skilled nursing care
> when the HHA participates in training programs that utilize student
> nurses enrolled in a school of nursing to perform skilled nursing

# - Psychiatric Evaluation, Therapy, and Teaching

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> The evaluation, psychotherapy, and teaching needed by a patient
> suffering from a diagnosed psychiatric disorder that requires active
> treatment by a psychiatrically trained nurse and the costs of the
> psychiatric nurse\'s services may be covered as a skilled nursing
> service. Psychiatrically trained nurses are nurses who have special
> training and/or
>
> experience beyond the standard curriculum required for a registered
> nurse. The services of the psychiatric nurse are to be provided under
> a plan of care established and reviewed by a physician or allowed
> practitioner.
>
> Because the law precludes agencies that primarily provide care and
> treatment of mental diseases from participating as HHAs, psychiatric
> nursing must be furnished by an agency that does not primarily provide
> care and treatment of mental diseases. If a substantial number of an
> HHA\'s patients attend partial hospitalization programs or receive
> outpatient mental health services, the Medicare contractor will verify
> whether the patients meet the eligibility requirements specified in
> §30 and whether the HHA is primarily engaged in care and treatment of
> mental disease.
>
> Services of a psychiatric nurse would not be considered reasonable and
> necessary to assess or monitor use of psychoactive drugs that are
> being used for non-psychiatric diagnoses or to monitor the condition
> of a patient with a known psychiatric illness who is on treatment but
> is considered stable. A person on treatment would be considered stable
> if their symptoms were absent or minimal or if symptoms were present
> but were relatively stable and did not create a significant disruption
> in the patient\'s normal living situation.

## EXAMPLE 1:

> A patient is homebound for medical conditions, but has a psychiatric
> condition for which he has been receiving medication. The patient\'s
> psychiatric condition has not required a change in medication or
> hospitalization for over 2 years. During a visit by the nurse, the
> patient\'s spouse indicates that the patient is awake and pacing most
> of the night and has begun ruminating about perceived failures in
> life. The nurse observes that the patient does not exhibit an
> appropriate level of hygiene and is dressed inappropriately for the
> season. The nurse comments to the patient about her observations and
> tries to solicit information about the patient\'s general medical
> condition and mental status. The nurse advises the physician about the
> patient\'s general medical condition and the new symptoms and changes
> in the patient\'s behavior. The physician orders the nurse to check
> blood levels of medication used to treat the patient\'s medical and
> psychiatric conditions. The physician then orders the psychiatric
> nursing service to evaluate the patient\'s mental health and
> communicate with the physician about whether additional intervention
> to deal with the patient\'s symptoms and behaviors is warranted. The
> home health record at each visit should document the need for the
> psychiatric skilled nursing services and treatment. The home health
> record must also reflect the patient/caregiver response to any
> interventions provided.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> A patient is homebound after discharge following hip replacement
> surgery and is receiving skilled therapy services for range of motion
> exercise and gait training. In the past, the patient had been
> diagnosed with clinical depression and was successfully stabilized on
> medication. There has been no change in her symptoms. The fact that
> the
>
> patient is taking an antidepressant does not indicate a need for
> psychiatric nursing services.

## EXAMPLE 3:

> A patient was discharged after 2 weeks in a psychiatric hospital with
> a new diagnosis of major depression. The patient remains withdrawn; in
> bed most of the day, and refusing to leave home. The patient has a
> depressed affect and continues to have thoughts of suicide, but is not
> considered to be suicidal. Psychiatric skilled nursing services are
> necessary for supportive interventions until antidepressant blood
> levels are reached and the suicidal thoughts are diminished further,
> to monitor suicide ideation, ensure medication compliance and patient
> safety, perform suicidal assessment, and teach crisis management and
> symptom management to family members. The home health record at each
> visit should document the need for the psychiatric skilled nursing
> services and treatment. The home health record must also reflect the
> patient/caregiver response to any interventions provided.

# - Intermittent Skilled Nursing Care

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> The law, at
> [[§1861(m)]{.underline}](https://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1861.htm)
> of the Act defines intermittent, for the purposes of §§1814(a)(2) and
> 1835(a)(2)(A), as skilled nursing care that is either provided or
> needed on fewer than 7 days each week, or less than 8 hours each day
> for periods of 21 days or less (with extensions in exceptional
> circumstances when the need for additional care is finite and
> predictable.)
>
> To meet the requirement for \"intermittent\" skilled nursing care, a
> patient must have a medically predictable recurring need for skilled
> nursing services. In most instances, this definition will be met if a
> patient requires a skilled nursing service at least once every 60
> days. The exception to the intermittent requirement is daily skilled
> nursing services for diabetics unable to administer their insulin
> (when there is no able and willing caregiver).
>
> Since the need for \"intermittent\" skilled nursing care makes the
> patient eligible for other covered home health services, the Medicare
> contractor should evaluate each claim involving skilled nursing
> services furnished less frequently than once every 60 days. In such
> cases, payment should be made only if documentation justifies a
> recurring need for reasonable, necessary, and medically predictable
> skilled nursing services. The following are examples of the need for
> infrequent, yet intermittent, skilled nursing services:

1.  The patient with an indwelling **silicone** catheter who generally
    needs a catheter change only at 90-day intervals;

2.  The patient who experiences a fecal impaction (i.e., loss of bowel
    tone, restrictive mobility, and a breakdown in good health habits)
    and must receive care to manually relieve the impaction. Although
    these impactions are likely to recur, it is not possible to pinpoint
    a specific timeframe; or

3.  The blind diabetic who self-injects insulin may have a medically
    predictable recurring need for a skilled nursing visit at least
    every 90 days. These visits, for example, would be to observe and
    determine the need for changes in the level and type of care which
    have been prescribed thus supplementing the physician or allowed
    practitioner\'s contacts with the patient.

> There is a possibility that a physician or allowed practitioner may
> order a skilled visit less frequently than once every 60 days for an
> eligible beneficiary if there exists an extraordinary circumstance of
> anticipated patient need that is documented in the patient\'s plan of
> care in accordance with [[42 CFR
> 409.43(b)]{.underline}](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title42-vol2/pdf/CFR-2014-title42-vol2-sec409-43.pdf).
> A skilled visit frequency of less than once every 60 days would only
> be covered if it is specifically ordered by a physician or allowed
> practitioner in the patient\'s plan of care and is considered to be a
> reasonable, necessary, and medically predictable skilled need for the
> patient in the individual circumstance.
>
> Where the need for \"intermittent\" skilled nursing visits is
> medically predictable but a situation arises after the first visit
> making additional visits unnecessary, e.g., the patient is
> institutionalized or dies, the one visit would be paid at the
> wage-adjusted LUPA amount for that discipline type. However, a
> one-time order; e.g., to give gamma globulin following exposure to
> hepatitis, would not be considered a need for \"intermittent\" skilled
> nursing care since a recurrence of the problem that would require this
> service is not medically predictable.
>
> Although most patients require services no more frequently than
> several times a week, Medicare will pay for part-time (as defined in
> [[§50.7]{.underline}](#part-time-or-intermittent-home-health-aide-and-skilled-nursing-services))
> medically reasonable and necessary skilled nursing care 7 days a week
> for a short period of time (2 to 3 weeks). There may also be a few
> cases involving unusual circumstances where the patient\'s prognosis
> indicates the medical need for daily skilled services will extend
> beyond 3 weeks. As soon as the patient\'s physician makes this
> judgment, which usually should be made before the end of the 3-week
> period, the HHA must forward medical documentation justifying the need
> for such additional services and include an estimate of how much
> longer daily skilled services will be required.
>
> A person expected to need more or less full-time skilled nursing care

# - General Principles Governing Reasonable and Necessary Physical Therapy, Speech-Language Pathology Services, and Occupational Therapy

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> The service of a physical therapist, speech-language pathologist, or
> occupational therapist is a skilled therapy service if the inherent
> complexity of the service is such that it can be performed safely
> and/or effectively only by or under the general supervision of a
> skilled therapist. To be covered, assuming all other eligibility and
> coverage criteria have been met, the skilled services must also be
> reasonable and necessary to the treatment of the patient\'s illness or
> injury or to the restoration or maintenance of function affected by
> the patient\'s illness or injury. It is necessary to determine whether
> individual therapy services are skilled and whether, in view of the
> patient\'s overall condition, skilled management of the services
> provided is needed.
>
> The development, implementation, management, and evaluation of a
> patient care plan based on the physician or allowed practitioner\'s
> orders constitute skilled therapy services when, because of the
> patient\'s clinical condition, those activities require the
> specialized skills, knowledge, and judgment of a qualified therapist
> to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment goals and ensure medical
> safety. Where the specialized skills, knowledge, and judgment of a
> therapist are needed to manage and periodically reevaluate the
> appropriateness of a maintenance program, such services would be
> covered, even if the skills of a therapist were not needed to carry
> out the activities performed as part of the maintenance program.
>
> While a patient\'s particular medical condition is a valid factor in
> deciding if skilled therapy services are needed, a patient\'s
> diagnosis or prognosis should never be the sole factor in deciding
> that a service is or is not skilled. The key issue is whether the
> skills of a therapist are needed to treat the illness or injury, or
> whether the services can be carried out by unskilled personnel.
>
> A service that is ordinarily considered unskilled could be considered
> a skilled therapy service in cases where there is clear documentation
> that, because of special medical complications, skilled rehabilitation
> personnel are required to perform the service.
>
> However, the importance of a particular service to a patient or the
> frequency with which it must be performed does not, by itself, make an
> unskilled service into a skilled service.
>
> Assuming all other eligibility and coverage criteria have been met,
> the skilled therapy services must be reasonable and necessary to the
> treatment of the patient\'s illness or injury within the context of
> the patient\'s unique medical condition. To be considered reasonable
> and necessary for the treatment of the illness or injury:

a.  The services must be consistent with the nature and severity of the
    illness or injury, the patient\'s particular medical needs,
    including the requirement that the amount, frequency, and duration
    of the services must be reasonable; and

b.  The services must be considered, under accepted standards of medical
    practice, to be specific, safe, and effective treatment for the
    patient\'s condition, meeting the standards noted below. The home
    health record must specify the purpose of the skilled service
    provided.

> To ensure therapy services are effective, at defined points during a
> course of treatment, for each therapy discipline for which services
> are provided, a qualified therapist (instead of an assistant) must
> perform the ordered therapy service. During this visit, the therapist
> must assess the patient using a method which allows for objective
> measurement of function and successive comparison of measurements. The
> therapist must document the measurement results in the clinical
> record. Specifically:

i.  **[Initial Therapy Assessment]{.underline}**

    -   For each therapy discipline for which services are provided, a
        > qualified therapist (instead of an assistant) must assess the
        > patient's function using a method which objectively measures
        > activities of daily living such as, but not limited to,
        > eating, swallowing, bathing, dressing, toileting, walking,
        > climbing stairs, using assistive devices, and mental and
        > cognitive factors. The measurement results must be documented
        > in the clinical record.

    -   Where more than one discipline of therapy is being provided, a
        > qualified therapist from each of the disciplines must
        > functionally assess the patient. The therapist must document
        > the measurement results which correspond to the therapist's
        > discipline and care plan goals in the clinical record.

ii. **[Reassessment at least every 30 days (performed in conjunction
    with an]{.underline} [ordered therapy service)]{.underline}**

    -   At least once every 30 days, for each therapy discipline for
        > which services are provided, a qualified therapist (instead of
        > an assistant) must provide the ordered therapy service,
        > functionally reassess the patient, and compare the resultant
        > measurement to prior assessment measurements. The therapist
        > must document in the clinical record the measurement results
        > along with the therapist's determination of the effectiveness
        > of therapy, or lack thereof.

    -   For multi-discipline therapy cases, a qualified therapist from
        > each of the disciplines must functionally reassess the
        > patient. The therapist must document the measurement results
        > which correspond to the therapist's discipline and care plan
        > goals in the clinical record.

    -   The 30-day clock begins with the first therapy service (of that
        > discipline) and the clock resets with each therapist's
        > visit/assessment/measurement/documentation (of that
        > discipline).

```
c.  Services involving activities for the general welfare of any
    patient, e.g., general exercises to promote overall fitness or
    flexibility and activities to provide diversion or general
    motivation do not constitute skilled therapy. Unskilled individuals
    without the supervision of a therapist can perform those services.

d.  Assuming all other eligibility and coverage requirements have been
    met, in order for therapy services to be covered, one of the
    following three conditions must be met:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  The skills of a qualified therapist, or by a qualified therapist
    assistant under the supervision of a qualified therapist, are needed
    to restore patient function:

    -   To meet this coverage condition, therapy services must be
        > provided with the expectation, based on the assessment made by
        > the physician or allowed practitioner of the patient\'s
        > restorative potential that the condition of the patient will
        > improve materially in a reasonable and generally predictable
        > period of time. Improvement is evidenced by objective
        > successive measurements.

    -   Therapy is not considered reasonable and necessary under this
        > condition if the patient's expected restorative potential
        > would be insignificant in relation to the extent and duration
        > of therapy services required to reach such potential.

    -   Therapy is not required to effect improvement or restoration of
        > function where a patient suffers a transient or easily
        > reversible loss of function (such as temporary weakness
        > following surgery) which could reasonably be expected to
        > improve spontaneously as the patient gradually resumes normal
        > activities. Therapy in such cases is not considered reasonable
        > and necessary to treat the patient's illness or injury, under
        > this condition. However, if the criteria for maintenance
        > therapy described in (3) below is met, therapy could be
        > covered under that condition.

2.  The patient's clinical condition requires the specialized skills,
    > knowledge, and judgment of a qualified therapist to establish or
    > design a maintenance program, related to the patient's illness or
    > injury, in order to ensure the safety of the patient and the
    > effectiveness of the program, to the extent provided by
    > regulation,

    -   For patients receiving rehabilitative/restorative therapy
        > services, if the specialized skills, knowledge, and judgment
        > of a qualified therapist are required to develop a maintenance
        > program, the expectation is that the development of that
        > maintenance program would occur during the last visit(s) for
        > rehabilitative/restorative treatment. The goals of a
        > maintenance program would be to maintain the patient's current
        > functional status or to prevent or slow further deterioration.

    -   Necessary periodic reevaluations by a qualified therapist of the
        > beneficiary and maintenance program are covered if the
        > specialized skills, knowledge, and judgment of a qualified
        > therapist are required.

    -   Where a maintenance program is not established until after the
        > rehabilitative/restorative therapy program has been completed,
        > or where there was no rehabilitative/restorative therapy
        > program, and the specialized skills, knowledge, and judgment
        > of a qualified therapist are required to develop a maintenance
        > program, such services would be considered reasonable and
        > necessary for the treatment of the patient's condition in
        > order to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment goals and
        > ensure medical safety. When the development of a maintenance
        > program could not be accomplished during the last visits(s) of
        > rehabilitative/restorative treatment, the therapist must
        > document why the maintenance program could not be developed
        > during those last rehabilitative/restorative treatment
        > visit(s).

    -   When designing or establishing a maintenance program, the
        > qualified therapist must teach the patient or the patient\'s
        > family or caregiver's necessary techniques, exercises or
        > precautions as necessary to treat the illness or injury. The
        > instruction of the beneficiary or appropriate caregiver by a
        > qualified therapist regarding a maintenance program is covered
        > if the specialized skills, knowledge, and judgment of a
        > qualified therapist are required. However, visits made by
        > skilled therapists to a patient\'s home solely to train other
        > HHA staff (e.g., home health aides) are not billable as visits

        > HHA staff is an administrative cost to the agency.

3.  The skills of a qualified therapist or by a qualified therapist
    > assistant under the supervision of a qualified therapist are
    > needed to perform maintenance therapy:

    -   Coverage of therapy services to perform a maintenance program is
        > not determined solely on the presence or absence of a

        > rather on the beneficiary's need for skilled care. Assuming
        > all other eligibility and coverage requirements are met,
        > skilled therapy services are covered when an individualized
        > assessment of the patient's clinical condition demonstrates
        > that the specialized judgment, knowledge, and skills of a
        > qualified therapist or by a qualified therapist assistant
        > under the supervision of a qualified therapist ("skilled
        > care") are necessary for the performance of a safe and
        > effective maintenance program. Such a maintenance program to
        > maintain the patient's current condition or to prevent or slow
        > further deterioration is covered so long as the beneficiary
        > requires skilled care for the safe and effective performance
        > of the program. When, however, the individualized

> assistant under the supervision of a qualified therapist because it
> could safely and effectively be accomplished by the patient or with
> the assistance of non- therapists, including unskilled caregivers,
> such maintenance services will not be covered.

-   Further, under the standard set forth in the previous paragraph,
    > skilled care is necessary for the performance of a safe and
    > effective maintenance program only when (a) the particular
    > patient's special medical complications require the skills of a
    > qualified therapist or by a qualified therapist assistant under

    > service that would otherwise be considered non-skilled; or (b) the
    > needed therapy procedures are of such complexity that the skills
    > of a qualified therapist are required to perform the procedure.

e.  The amount, frequency, and duration of the services must be
    reasonable.

> As is outlined in home health regulations, as part of the home health
> agency (HHA) Conditions of Participation (CoPs), the clinical record
> of the patient must contain progress and clinical notes. Additionally,
> in Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 10; "Home
> Health Agency Billing", instructions specify that for each claim, HHAs
> are required to report all services provided to the beneficiary during
> each 30-day period, this includes reporting each visit in line-item
> detail. As such, it is expected that the home health records for every
> visit will reflect the need for the skilled medical care provided.
> These clinical notes are also expected to provide important
> communication among all members of the home care team regarding the
> development, course and outcomes of the skilled observations,
> assessments, treatment and training performed. Taken as a whole then,
> the clinical notes are expected to tell the story of the patient's
> achievement towards his/her goals as outlined in the Plan of Care. In
> this way, the notes will serve to demonstrate why a skilled service is
> needed.
>
> Therefore the home health clinical notes must document as appropriate:

-   the history and physical exam pertinent to the day's visit ,
    > (including the response or changes in behavior to previously
    > administered skilled services) and

-   the skilled services applied on the current visit, and

-   the patient/caregiver's immediate response to the skilled services
    > provided, and

-   the plan for the next visit based on the rationale of prior results.

> Clinical notes should be written such that they adequately describe
> the reaction of a patient to his/her skilled care. Clinical notes
> should also provide a clear picture of the treatment, as well as "next
> steps" to be taken. Vague or subjective descriptions of the patient's
> care should not be used. For example terminology such as the following
> would not adequately describe the need for skilled care:

-   Patient tolerated treatment well

-   Caregiver instructed in medication management

-   Continue with POC

> Objective measurements of physical outcomes of treatment should be
> provided and/or a clear description of the changed behaviors due to
> education programs should be recorded in order that all concerned can
> follow the results of the applied services.
>
> When the skilled service is being provided to either maintain the

> clinical notes must also describe:

-   A detailed rationale that explains the need for the skilled service
    > in light of the patient's overall medical condition and
    > experiences,

-   the complexity of the service to be performed, and

-   any other pertinent characteristics of the beneficiary or home.

    1.  # - Application of the Principles to Physical Therapy Services

### (Rev. 179, Issued: 01-14-14, Effective: 01-07-14, Implementation: 01-07-14)

> The following discussion of skilled physical therapy services applies
> the principles in
>
> [[§40.2]{.underline}.](#rev.-10438-issued-11-06-20-effective-03-01-20-implementation-01--11-21-28)[1]{.underline}
> to specific physical therapy services about which questions are most
> frequently raised.

### Assessment

> Assuming all other eligibility and coverage requirements have been
> met, the skills of a physical therapist to assess and periodically
> reassess a patient\'s rehabilitation needs and potential or to develop
> and/or implement a physical therapy program are covered when they are
> reasonable and necessary because of the patient\'s condition. Skilled
> rehabilitation services concurrent with the management of a patient\'s
> care plan include objective tests and measurements such as, but not
> limited to, range of motion, strength, balance, coordination,
> endurance, or functional ability.
>
> As described in section 40.2.1(b), at defined points during a course
> of therapy, the qualified physical therapist (instead of an assistant)
> must perform the ordered therapy service visit, assess the patient's
> function using a method which allows for objective measurement of
> function and comparison of successive measurements, and document the
> results of the assessments, corresponding measurements, and
> effectiveness of the therapy
>
> in the patient's clinical record. Refer to §40.2.1(b) for specific
> timing and documentation requirements associated with these
> requirements.

### Therapeutic Exercises

> Therapeutic exercises, which require the skills of a qualified
> physical therapist to ensure the safety of the beneficiary and the
> effectiveness of the treatment constitute skilled physical therapy,
> when the criteria in §40.2.1(d) above are met.

### Gait Training

> Gait evaluation and training furnished to a patient whose ability to
> walk has been impaired by neurological, muscular or skeletal
> abnormality require the skills of a qualified physical therapist and
> constitute skilled physical therapy and are considered reasonable and
> necessary if they can be expected to materially improve or maintain
> the patient\'s ability to walk or prevent or slow further
> deterioration of the patient's ability to walk. Gait evaluation and
> training which is furnished to a patient whose ability to walk has
> been impaired by a condition other than a neurological, muscular, or
> skeletal abnormality would nevertheless be covered where physical
> therapy is reasonable and necessary to restore or maintain function or
> to prevent or slow further deterioration. Refer to §40.2.1(d)(1) for
> the reasonable and necessary coverage criteria associated with
> restoring patient function.

## EXAMPLE 1:

> A physician has ordered gait evaluation and training for a patient
> whose gait has been materially impaired by scar tissue resulting from
> burns. Physical therapy services to evaluate the beneficiary\'s gait,
> establish a gait training program, and provide the skilled services
> necessary to implement the program would be covered. The patient's
> response to therapy must be documented. At appropriate intervals (see
> above), the qualified therapist must assess the patient with objective
> measurements of function.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> A patient who has had a total hip replacement is ambulatory but
> demonstrates weakness and is unable to climb stairs safely. Physical
> therapy would be reasonable and necessary to teach the patient to
> climb and descend stairs safely. Once the patient has reached the goal
> of climbing and descending stairs safely, additional therapy services
> are no longer required, and thus would not be covered.

## EXAMPLE 3:

> A patient who has received gait training has reached their maximum
> restoration potential, and the physical therapist is teaching the
> patient and family how to safely perform the activities that are a
> part of the maintenance program. The visits by the physical therapist
> to demonstrate and teach the activities (which by themselves do not
> require the skills of a therapist) would be covered since they are
> needed to establish the program (refer to
>
> §40.2.1(d)(2)). The patient's and caregiver's understanding and
> implementation of the maintenance program must be documented. After
> the establishment of the maintenance program, any further visits would
> need to document why the skilled services of a physical therapist are
> still required.

### Range of Motion

> Only a qualified physical therapist may perform range of motion tests
> and, therefore, such tests are skilled physical therapy.
>
> Range of motion exercises constitute skilled physical therapy only if
> they are part of an active treatment for a specific disease state,
> illness, or injury that has resulted in a loss or restriction of
> mobility (as evidenced by physical therapy notes showing the degree of
> motion lost and the degree to be restored). Unskilled individuals may
> provide range of motion exercises unrelated to the restoration of a
> specific loss of function often safely and effectively. Passive
> exercises to maintain range of motion in paralyzed extremities that
> can be carried out by unskilled persons do not constitute skilled
> physical therapy.
>
> However, if the criteria in
> [[§40.2]{.underline}](#rev.-10438-issued-11-06-20-effective-03-01-20-implementation-01--11-21-28).1(d)(3)
> are met, where there is clear documentation that, because of special
> medical complications (e.g., susceptible to pathological bone
> fractures), the skills of a therapist are needed to provide services
> which ordinarily do not need the skills of a therapist, and then the
> services would be covered.

### Maintenance Therapy

> Where services that are required to maintain the patient's current
> function or to prevent or slow further deterioration are of such
> complexity and sophistication that the skills of a qualified therapist
> are required to perform the procedure safely and effectively, the
> services would be covered physical therapy services. Further, where
> the particular patient's special medical complications require the
> skills of a qualified therapist to perform a therapy service safely
> and effectively that would otherwise be considered unskilled, such
> services would be covered physical therapy services. Refer to
>
> [§40.2]{.underline}.1(d)(3).

## EXAMPLE 4:

> Where there is an unhealed, unstable fracture that requires regular
> exercise to maintain function until the fracture heals, the skills of
> a physical therapist would be needed to ensure that the fractured
> extremity is maintained in proper position and alignment during
> maintenance range of motion exercises.

## EXAMPLE 5:

> A Parkinson\'s patient or a patient with rheumatoid arthritis who has
> not been under a restorative physical therapy program may require the
> services of a physical therapist to determine what type of exercises
> are required to maintain the patient\'s present level of function or
> to prevent or slow further deterioration. The initial evaluation of
> the patient\'s
>
> needs, the designing of a maintenance program appropriate to the
> patient's capacity and tolerance and to the treatment objectives of
> the physician, the instruction of the patient, family or caregivers to
> carry out the program safely and effectively, and such reevaluations
> as may be required by the patient\'s condition, would constitute
> skilled physical therapy. Each component of this process must be
> documented in the home health record.
>
> While a patient is under a restorative physical therapy program, the
> physical therapist should regularly reevaluate the patient\'s
> condition and adjust any exercise program the patient is expected to
> carry out alone or with the aid of supportive personnel to maintain
> the function being restored. Consequently, by the time it is
> determined that no further restoration is possible (i.e., by the end
> of the last restorative session) the physical therapist will already
> have designed the maintenance program required and instructed the
> patient or caregivers in carrying out the program.

### Ultrasound, Shortwave, and Microwave Diathermy Treatments

> These treatments must always be performed by or under the supervision
> of a qualified physical therapist and are skilled therapy.

### Hot Packs, Infra-Red Treatments, Paraffin Baths and Whirlpool Baths

> Heat treatments and baths of this type ordinarily do not require the
> skills of a qualified physical therapist. However, the skills,
> knowledge, and judgment of a qualified physical therapist might be
> required in the giving of such treatments or baths in a particular
> case, e.g., where the patient\'s condition is complicated by
> circulatory deficiency, areas of desensitization, open wounds,
> fractures, or other complications. There must be clear documentation
> in the home health record, of the special medical complications that
> describe the need for the skilled services provided by the therapist.

### Wound Care Provided Within Scope of State Practice Acts

> If wound care falls within the auspice of a physical therapist\'s
> State Practice Act, then the physical therapist may provide the
> specific type of wound care services defined in the State Practice
> Act. However, such visits in this specific situation would be a
> covered therapy service when there is documentation in the home health
> record that the skills of a therapist are required to perform the
> service. The patient's response to therapy must be documented.

# - Application of the General Principles to Speech-Language Pathology Services

> requirements.

1.  The skills of a speech-language pathologist are required for the
    assessment of a patient\'s rehabilitation needs (including the
    causal factors and the severity of the speech and language
    disorders), and rehabilitation potential. Reevaluation would be
    considered reasonable and necessary only if the patient exhibited:

    -   A change in functional speech or motivation;

    -   Clearing of confusion; or

    -   The remission of some other medical condition that previously
        > contraindicated speech-language pathology services.

> Where a patient is undergoing restorative speech-language pathology
> services, routine reevaluations are considered to be a part of the
> therapy and cannot be billed as a separate visit.

2.  The services of a speech-language pathologist would be covered if
    they are needed as a result of an illness or injury and are directed
    towards specific speech/voice production.

3.  Speech-language pathology would be covered where a skilled service
    can only be provided by a speech-language pathologist and where it
    is reasonably expected that the skilled service will improve,
    maintain, or prevent or slow further deterioration in the patient's
    ability to carry out communication or feeding activities.

4.  The services of a speech-language pathologist to establish a
    hierarchy of speech- voice-language communication tasks and cueing
    that directs a patient toward speech- language communication goals
    in the plan of care would be covered speech-language pathology.

5.  The services of a speech-language pathologist to train the patient,
    family, or other caregivers to augment the speech-language
    communication, treatment, to establish an effective maintenance
    program, or carry out a safe and effective maintenance

> program when the particular patient's special medical complications
> require the skills of a qualified therapist (not an assistant) to
> perform a therapy service that would otherwise be considered unskilled
> or the needed therapy procedures are of such complexity that the
> skills of a qualified therapist are required to perform the
> procedures, would be covered speech-language pathology services.

6.  The services of a speech-language pathologist to assist patients
    with aphasia in rehabilitation of speech and language skills are
    covered when needed by a patient.

7.  The services of a speech-language pathologist to assist patients
    with voice disorders to develop proper control of the vocal and
    respiratory systems for correct voice production are covered when
    needed by a patient.

    1.  # - Application of the General Principles to Occupational Therapy

# - Assessment

### (Rev. 179, Issued: 01-14-14, Effective: 01-07-14, Implementation: 01-07-14)

> Assuming all other eligibility and coverage requirements are met, the
> skills of an occupational therapist to assess and reassess a
> patient\'s rehabilitation needs and potential or to develop and/or

# - Planning, Implementing, and Supervision of Therapeutic Programs

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

## A3-3118.2.D.2, HHA-205.2.D.2

> The planning, implementing, and supervision of therapeutic programs
> including, but not limited to those listed below are skilled
> occupational therapy services, and if reasonable and necessary to the
> treatment of the patient\'s illness or injury would be covered.

### Selecting and Teaching Task Oriented Therapeutic Activities Designed to Restore Physical Function.

> **EXAMPLE:** Use of woodworking activities on an inclined table to
> restore shoulder, elbow, and wrist range of motion lost as a result of
> burns.

### Planning, Implementing, and Supervising Therapeutic Tasks and Activities Designed to Restore Sensory-Integrative Function.

> **EXAMPLE:** Providing motor and tactile activities to increase
> sensory output and improve response for a stroke patient with
> functional loss resulting in a distorted body image.

### Planning, Implementing, and Supervising of Individualized Therapeutic Activity Programs as Part of an Overall \"Active Treatment\" Program for a Patient With a Diagnosed Psychiatric Illness.

> **EXAMPLE:** Use of sewing activities that require following a pattern
> to reduce confusion and restore reality orientation in a schizophrenic
> patient.

### Teaching Compensatory Techniques to Improve the Level of Independence in the Activities of Daily Living.

> **EXAMPLE:** Teaching a patient who has lost use of an arm how to pare
> potatoes and chop vegetables with one hand.
>
> **EXAMPLE:** Teaching a stroke patient new techniques to enable them
> to perform feeding, dressing, and other activities of daily living as
> independently as possible.

### The Designing, Fabricating, and Fitting of Orthotic and Self-Help Devices.

> **EXAMPLE:** Construction of a device which would enable a patient to
> hold a utensil and feed themselves independently.
>
> **EXAMPLE:** Construction of a hand splint for a patient with
> rheumatoid arthritis to maintain the hand in a functional position.

### Vocational and Prevocational Assessment and Training

> Vocational and prevocational assessment and training that is directed
> toward the restoration of function in the activities of daily living
> lost due to illness or injury would
>
> be covered. Where vocational or prevocational assessment and training
> is related solely to specific employment opportunities, work skills,
> or work settings, such services would not be covered because they
> would not be directed toward the treatment of an illness or injury.

# - Illustration of Covered Services

> **(Rev. 179, Issued: 01-14-14, Effective: 01-07-14, Implementation:
> 01-07-14) A3-3118.2.D.3, HHA-205.2.D.3**

## EXAMPLE 1:

> A physician orders occupational therapy for a patient who is
> recovering from a fractured hip and who needs to be taught
> compensatory and safety techniques with regard to lower extremity
> dressing, hygiene, toileting, and bathing. The occupational therapist
> will establish goals for the patient\'s rehabilitation (to be approved
> by the physician), and will undertake teaching techniques necessary
> for the patient to reach the goals. Occupational therapy services
> would be covered at a duration and intensity appropriate to the
> severity of the impairment and the patient\'s response to treatment.
> Such visits would be considered covered when the skills of a therapist
> are required to perform the services.
>
> The patient's needs in response to therapy must be documented.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> A physician has ordered occupational therapy for a patient who is
> recovering from a CVA. The patient has decreased range of motion,
> strength, and sensation in both the upper and lower extremities on the
> right side. In addition, the patient has perceptual and cognitive
> deficits resulting from the CVA. The patient\'s condition has resulted
> in decreased function in activities of daily living (specifically
> bathing, dressing, grooming, hygiene, and toileting). The loss of
> function requires assistive devices to enable the patient to
> compensate for the loss of function and maximize safety and
> independence.
>
> The patient also needs equipment such as himi-slings to prevent
> shoulder subluxation and a hand splint to prevent joint contracture
> and deformity in the right hand. The services of an occupational
> therapist would be necessary to:

-   Assess the patient\'s needs;

-   Develop goals (to be approved by the physician);

-   Manufacture or adapt the needed equipment to the patient\'s use;

-   Teach compensatory techniques;

-   Strengthen the patient as necessary to permit use of compensatory
    techniques; and

-   Provide activities that are directed towards meeting the goals
    governing increased perceptual and cognitive function.

> Occupational therapy services would be covered at a duration and
> intensity appropriate to the severity of the impairment and the
> patient\'s response to treatment. Such visits would be considered
> covered therapy services when the skills of a therapist are required
> to perform the services. The patient's needs, course of therapy and

# - Home Health Aide Services

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> For home health aide services to be covered:

-   The patient must meet the qualifying criteria as specified in
    [[§30]{.underline}](#conditions-patient-must-meet-to-qualify-for-coverage-of-home-health-services);

-   The services provided by the home health aide must be part-time or
    intermittent as discussed in
    [[§50.7]{.underline}](#part-time-or-intermittent-home-health-aide-and-skilled-nursing-services);

-   The services must meet the definition of home health aide services
    of this section; and

-   The services must be reasonable and necessary to the treatment of
    the patient\'s illness or injury.

> **NOTE:** A home health aide must be certified consistent the
> competency evaluation requirements.
>
> The reason for the visits by the home health aide must be to provide
> hands-on personal care of the patient or services needed to maintain
> the patient\'s health or to facilitate treatment of the patient\'s
> illness or injury.
>
> The physician or allowed practitioner\'s order should indicate the
> frequency of the home health aide services required by the patient.
> These services may include but are not limited to:

### Personal Care

> Personal care means:

1.  Bathing, dressing, grooming, caring for hair, nail, and oral hygiene
    which are needed to facilitate treatment or to prevent deterioration
    of the patient\'s health, changing the bed linens of an incontinent
    patient, shaving, deodorant application, skin care with lotions
    and/or powder, foot care, and ear care; and

2.  Feeding, assistance with elimination (including enemas unless the
    skills of a licensed nurse are required due to the patient\'s
    condition, routine catheter care and routine colostomy care),
    assistance with ambulation, changing position in bed, assistance
    with transfers.

## EXAMPLE 1:

> A physician has ordered home health aide visits to assist the patient
> in personal care because the patient is recovering from a stroke and
> continues to have significant right side weakness that causes the
> patient to be unable to bathe, dress or perform hair and oral care.
> The plan of care established by the HHA nurse sets forth the specific
> tasks with which the patient needs assistance. Home health aide visits
> at an appropriate frequency would be reasonable and necessary to
> assist in these tasks.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> A physician ordered four home health aide visits per week for personal
> care for a multiple sclerosis patient who is unable to perform these
> functions because of increasing debilitation. The home health aide
> gave the patient a bath twice per week and washed hair on the other
> two visits each week. Only two visits are reasonable and necessary
> since the services could have been provided in the course of two
> visits.

## EXAMPLE 3:

> A physician ordered seven home health aide visits per week for
> personal care for a bed- bound, incontinent patient. All visits are
> reasonable and necessary because the patient has extensive personal
> care needs.

## EXAMPLE 4:

> A patient with a well-established colostomy forgets to change the bag
> regularly and has difficulty changing the bag. Home health aide
> services at an appropriate frequency to change the bag would be
> considered reasonable and necessary to the treatment of the illness or
> injury.

### Simple Dressing Changes That Do Not Require the Skills of a Licensed Nurse EXAMPLE 5:

> A patient who is confined to the bed has developed a small reddened
> area on the buttocks. The physician has ordered home health aide
> visits for more frequent repositioning, bathing and the application of
> a topical ointment and a gauze 4x4. Home health aide visits at an
> appropriate frequency would be reasonable and necessary.

### Assistance With Medications Which Are Ordinarily Self-Administered and Do Not Require the Skills of a Licensed Nurse to Be Provided Safely and Effectively

> **NOTE:** Prefilling of insulin syringes is ordinarily performed by
> the diabetic as part of the self-administration of the insulin and,
> unlike the injection of the insulin, does not require the skill of a
> licensed nurse to be performed properly. Therefore, if HHA staff
> performs the prefilling of insulin syringes, it is considered to be a
> home health aide service. However, where State law precludes the
> provision of this service by other than a licensed nurse or physician,
> Medicare will make payment for this service, when covered, as though
> it were a skilled nursing service. Where the patient needs only
> prefilling of insulin syringes and does not need skilled nursing care
> on an intermittent basis, physical therapy, speech-language pathology
> services, or have a continuing need for occupational therapy, then
> Medicare cannot cover any home health services to the patient (even if
> State law requires that the insulin syringes be filled by a licensed
> nurse).
>
> Home health aide services are those services ordered in the plan of
> care that the aide is permitted to perform under State law. Medicare
> coverage of the administration of insulin by a home health aide will

D.  ### Assistance With Activities which Are Directly Supportive of Skilled Therapy Services but Do Not Require the Skills of a Therapist to Be Safely and Effectively Performed Such as Routine Maintenance Exercises and Repetitive Practice of Functional Communication Skills to Support Speech-Language Pathology Services

E.  **Provision of Services Incidental to Personal Care Services not
    Care of Prosthetic and Orthotic Devices**

> When a home health aide visits a patient to provide a health related
> service as discussed above, the home health aide may also perform some
> incidental services which do not meet the definition of a home health
> aide service (e.g., light cleaning, preparation of a meal, taking out
> the trash, shopping, etc.) However, the purpose of a home health aide
> visit may not be to provide these incidental services since they are
> not health related services, but rather are necessary household tasks
> that must be performed by anyone to maintain a home.

## EXAMPLE 1:

> A home health aide visits a recovering stroke patient whose right side
> weakness and poor endurance cause her to be able to leave the bed and
> chair only with extreme difficulty.
>
> The physician has ordered physical therapy and speech-language
> pathology services for the patient and home health aide services three
> or four times per week for personal care, assistance with ambulation
> as mobility increases, and assistance with repetitive speech exercises
> as her impaired speech improves. The home health aide also provides
> incidental household services such as preparation of meals, light
> cleaning and taking out the trash. The patient lives with an elderly
> frail sister who is disabled and who cannot perform either the
> personal care or the incidental tasks. The home health aide visits at
> a frequency appropriate to the performance of the health related
> services would be covered, notwithstanding the incidental provision of
> noncovered services (i.e., the household services) in the course of
> the visits.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> A physician orders home health aide visits three times per week. The
> only services provided are light housecleaning, meal preparation and
> trash removal. The home health aide visits cannot be covered,
> notwithstanding their importance to the patient, because the services
> provided do not meet Medicare\'s definition of \"home health aide
> services.\"

# - Medical Social Services

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

## A3-3119.3, HHA-206.3

> Medical social services that are provided by a qualified medical
> social worker or a social work assistant under the supervision of a
> qualified medical social worker may be covered as home health services
> where the beneficiary meets the qualifying criteria specified in
>
> [[§30]{.underline}](#conditions-patient-must-meet-to-qualify-for-coverage-of-home-health-services),
> and:

1.  The services of these professionals are necessary to resolve social
    or emotional problems that are or are expected to be an impediment
    to the effective treatment of the patient\'s medical condition or
    rate of recovery; and

2.  The plan of care indicates how the services which are required
    necessitate the skills of a qualified social worker or a social work
    assistant under the supervision of a qualified medical social worker
    to be performed safely and effectively.

> Where both of these requirements for coverage are met, services of
> these professionals which may be covered include, but are not limited
> to:

1.  Assessment of the social and emotional factors related to the
    patient\'s illness, need for care, response to treatment and
    adjustment to care;

2.  Assessment of the relationship of the patient\'s medical and nursing
    requirements to the patient\'s home situation, financial resources
    and availability of community resources;

3.  Appropriate action to obtain available community resources to assist
    in resolving the patient\'s problem (**NOTE:** Medicare does not
    cover the services of a medical social worker to complete or assist
    in the completion of an application for Medicaid because Federal
    regulations require the State to provide assistance in completing
    the application to anyone who chooses to apply for Medicaid.);

4.  Counseling services that are required by the patient; and

5.  Medical social services furnished to the patient\'s family member or
    caregiver on a short-term basis when the HHA can demonstrate that a
    brief intervention (that is, two or three visits) by a medical
    social worker is necessary to remove a clear and direct impediment
    to the effective treatment of the patient\'s medical condition or to
    the patient\'s rate of recovery. To be considered \"clear and
    direct,\" the behavior or actions of the family member or caregiver
    must plainly obstruct, contravene, or prevent the patient\'s medical
    treatment or rate of recovery. Medical social services to address
    general problems that do not clearly and directly impede treatment
    or recovery as well as long-term social services furnished to family
    members, such as ongoing alcohol counseling, are not covered.

> **NOTE:** Participating in the development of the plan of care,
> preparing clinical and progress notes, participating in discharge
> planning and in-service programs, and acting as a consultant to other
> agency personnel are appropriate administrative costs to the HHA.

## EXAMPLE 1:

> The physician has ordered a medical social worker assessment of a
> diabetic patient who has recently become insulin dependent and is not
> yet stabilized. The nurse, who is providing skilled observation and
> evaluation to try to restabilize the patient notices during her visits
> that the supplies left in the home for the patient\'s use appear to be
> frequently missing, and the patient is not compliant with the regimen
> although she refuses to discuss the matter. The assessment by a
> medical social worker would be reasonable and necessary to determine
> if there are underlying social or emotional problems impeding the
> patient\'s treatment.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> A physician ordered an assessment by a medical social worker for a
> multiple sclerosis patient who was unable to move anything but her
> head and who had an indwelling catheter. The patient had experienced
> recurring urinary tract infections and multiple infected ulcers. The
> physician ordered medical social services after the HHA indicated to
> him that the home was not well cared for, the patient appeared to be
> neglected much of the time, and the relationship between the patient
> and family was very poor. The physician and HHA were concerned that
> social problems created by family caregivers were impeding the
> treatment of the recurring infections and ulcers. The assessment and
> follow-up for counseling both the patient and the family by a medical
> social worker were reasonable and necessary.

## EXAMPLE 3:

> A physician is aware that a patient with atherosclerosis and
> hypertension is not taking medications as ordered and adhering to
> dietary restrictions because he is unable to afford the medication and
> is unable to cook. The physician orders several visits by a medical
> social worker to assist in resolving these problems. The visits by the
> medical social worker to review the patient\'s financial status,
> discuss options, and make appropriate contacts with social services
> agencies or other community resources to arrange for medications and
> meals would be a reasonable and necessary medical social service.

## EXAMPLE 4:

> A physician has ordered counseling by a medical social worker for a
> patient with cirrhosis of the liver who has recently been discharged
> from a 28-day inpatient alcohol treatment program to her home which
> she shares with an alcoholic and neglectful adult child. The physician
> has ordered counseling several times per week to assist the patient in
> remaining free of alcohol and in dealing with the adult child. The
> services of the medical social worker would be covered until the
> patient\'s social situation ceased to impact on her recovery and/or
> treatment.

## EXAMPLE 5:

> A physician has ordered medical social services for a patient who is
> worried about his financial arrangements and payment for medical care.
> The services ordered are to arrange Medicaid if possible and resolve
> unpaid medical bills. There is no evidence that the patient\'s
> concerns are adversely impacting recovery or treatment of his illness
> or injury. Medical social services cannot be covered.

## EXAMPLE 6:

> A physician has ordered medical social services for a patient of
> extremely limited income who has incurred large unpaid hospital and
> other medical bills following a significant illness. The patient\'s
> recovery is adversely affected because the patient is not maintaining
> a proper therapeutic diet, and cannot leave the home to acquire the
> medication necessary to treat their illness. The medical social worker
> reviews the patient\'s financial status, arranges meal service to
> resolve the dietary problem, arranges for home delivered
>
> medications, gathers the information necessary for application to
> Medicaid to acquire coverage for the medications the patient needs,
> files the application on behalf of the patient, and follows up
> repeatedly with the Medicaid State agency.
>
> The medical social services that are necessary to review the financial
> status of the patient, arrange for meal service and delivery of
> medications to the home, and arrange for the Medicaid State agency to
> assist the patient with the application for Medicaid are covered.
>
> The services related to the assistance in filing the application for
> Medicaid and the follow-up on the application are not covered since
> they must be provided by the State agency free of charge, and hence
> the patient has no obligation to pay for such assistance.

## EXAMPLE 7:

> A physician has ordered medical social services for an insulin
> dependent diabetic whose blood sugar is elevated because she has run
> out of syringes and missed her insulin dose for two days. Upon making
> the assessment visit, the medical social worker learns that the
> patient\'s daughter, who is also an insulin dependent diabetic, has
> come to live with the patient because she is out of work. The daughter
> is now financially dependent on the patient for all of her financial
> needs and has been using the patient\'s insulin syringes. The social
> worker assesses the patient\'s financial resources and determines that
> they are adequate to support the patient and meet her own medical
> needs, but are not sufficient to support the daughter. She also
> counsels the daughter and helps her access community resources. These
> visits would be covered, but only to the extent that the services are
> necessary to prevent interference with the patient\'s treatment plan.

## EXAMPLE 8:

> A wife is caring for her husband who is an Alzheimer\'s patient. The
> nurse learns that the wife has not been giving the patient his
> medication correctly and seems distracted and forgetful about various
> aspects of the patient\'s care. In a conversation with the nurse, the
> wife relates that she is feeling depressed and overwhelmed by the
> patient\'s illness. The nurse contacts the patient\'s physician who
> orders a social work evaluation. In her assessment visit, the social
> worker learns that the patient\'s wife is so distraught over her
> situation that she cannot provide adequate care to the patient. While
> there, the social worker counsels the wife and assists her with
> referrals to a support group and her private physician for evaluation
> of her depression. The services would be covered.

## EXAMPLE 9:

> The parent of a dependent disabled child has been discharged from the
> hospital following a hip replacement. Although arrangements for care
> of the disabled child during the hospitalization were made, the child
> has returned to the home. During a visit to the patient, the nurse
> observes that the patient is transferring the child from bed to a
> wheelchair. In an effort to avoid impeding the patient\'s recovery,
> the nurse contacts the patient\'s physician to order a visit by a
> social worker to mobilize family members or otherwise arrange for
> temporary care of the disabled child. The services would be covered.

# - Medical Supplies

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> Medical supplies are items that, due to their therapeutic or
> diagnostic characteristics, are essential in enabling HHA personnel to
> conduct home visits or to carry out effectively the care the physician
> has ordered for the treatment or diagnosis of the patient\'s illness
> or injury. All supplies which would have been covered under the
> cost-based reimbursement system are bundled under home health PPS.
> Payment for the cost of supplies has been incorporated into the per
> visit and 30-day period payment rates. Supplies fit into two
> categories. They are classified as:

-   **Routine -** because they are used in small quantities for patients
    during the usual course of most home visits; or

-   **Nonroutine -** because they are needed to treat a patient\'s
    specific illness or injury in accordance with the physician or
    allowed practitioner\'s plan of care and meet further conditions
    discussed in more detail below.

> All HHAs are expected to separately identify in their records the cost

> conjunction with patient care visits and the use of which are directly
> identifiable to an individual patient.

# - The Law, Routine and Nonroutine Medical Supplies, and the Patient\'s Plan of Care

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

A.  **The Law**

> The Medicare law governing the home health PPS is specific to the type
> of items and services bundled to the HHA and the time the services are
> bundled. Medical supplies are bundled while the patient is under a
> home health plan of care. If a patient is admitted for a condition
> which is related to a chronic condition that requires a medical supply
> (e.g., ostomy patient) the HHA is required to provide the medical
> supply while the patient is under a home health plan of care during a
> 30-day period of care. The physician or allowed practitioner's orders
> in the plan of care must reflect all nonroutine medical supplies
> provided and used while the patient is under a home health plan of
> care. The consolidated billing requirement is not superseded by the
> exclusion of certain medical supplies from the plan of care and then
> distinguishing between medical supplies that are related and unrelated
> to the plan of care. Failure to include medical supplies on the plan
> of care does not relieve HHAs from the obligation to comply with the
> consolidated
>
> billing requirements. The comprehensive nature of the current patient
> assessment and plan of care requirements looks at the totality of
> patient needs. However, there could be a circumstance where a
> physician or allowed practitioner could be uncomfortable with writing
> orders for a preexisting condition unrelated to the reason for home
> health care. In those circumstances, PRN orders for such supplies may
> be used in the plan of care by a physician or allowed practitioner.
>
> Thus, all medical supplies are bundled while the patient is under a
> home health plan of care. This includes, but is not limited to, the
> above listed medical supplies as well as the Part B items provided in
> the final PPS rule. The latter item lists are subsequently updated in
> accordance with the current process governing the deletion,
> replacement and revision of Medicare Part B codes. Parenteral and
> enteral nutrition, prosthetics, orthotics, DME and DME supplies are
> not considered medical supplies and therefore not subject to bundling
> while the patient is under a home health plan of care. However,
> [[§1834(h)(4)(c)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Act specifically excludes from the term \"orthotics and
> prosthetics\" medical supplies including catheters, catheter supplies,
> ostomy bags and supplies related to ostomy care furnished by an HHA
> under [[§1861(m)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Act. Therefore, these items are bundled while a patient is under a
> home health plan of care.

### Relationship Between Patient Choice and Veterans Benefits

> For veterans, both Medicare and Veteran\'s Administration (VA)
> benefits are primary. Therefore, the beneficiary who is a veteran has
> some choices in cases where the benefits overlap. The beneficiary,
> however, must select one or the other program as primary when
> obtaining active care. If the VA is selected as primary for home
> health care, then Medicare becomes a secondary payer. An HHA must
> provide the medical supplies a Medicare beneficiary needs no matter
> the payer; it is not obligated to provide medical supplies that are
> not needed. If a patient has medical supplies provided by the VA
> because of the patient\'s preference, then the HHA must not duplicate
> the supplies under Medicare. The beneficiary\'s choice is controlling.
> The HHA may not require the beneficiary to obtain or use medical
> supplies covered by the primary payer from any other source, including
> the VA.

### Medical Supplies Purchased by the Patient Prior to the Start of Care

> A patient may have acquired medical supplies prior to his/her Medicare
> home health start of care date. If a patient prefers to use his or her
> own medical supplies after having been offered appropriate supplies by
> the HHA and it is determined by the HHA that the patient\'s medical
> supplies are clinically appropriate, then the patient\'s choice is
> controlling. The HHA is not required to duplicate the medical supplies
> if the patient elects to use his or her own medical supplies. However,
> if the patient prefers to have the HHA provide medical supplies while
> the patient is under a Medicare home health plan of care, then the HHA
> must provide the medical supplies. The HHA may not require that the
> patient obtain or use medical supplies from any other source. Given
> the possibility of subsequent misunderstandings arising between the
> HHA and the patient on this issue, the HHA should document the
> beneficiary\'s decision to decline HHA furnished medical supplies and
> use their own resources.

# - Routine Supplies (Nonreportable)

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> Routine supplies are supplies that are customarily used in small
> quantities during the course of most home care visits. They are
> usually included in the staff\'s supplies and not designated for a
> specific patient. These supplies are included in the cost per visit of
> home health care services. Routine supplies would not include those
> supplies that are specifically ordered by the physician or allowed
> practitioner or are essential to HHA personnel in order to effectuate
> the plan of care.
>
> Examples of supplies which are usually considered routine include, but
> are not limited to:

A.  ### Dressings and Skin Care

    -   Swabs, alcohol preps, and skin prep pads;

    -   Tape removal pads;

    -   Cotton balls;

    -   Adhesive and paper tape;

    -   Nonsterile applicators; and

    -   4 x 4\'s.

B.  ### Infection Control Protection

    -   Nonsterile gloves;

    -   Aprons;

    -   Masks; and

    -   Gowns.

C.  ### Blood Drawing Supplies

    -   Specimen containers.

D.  ### Incontinence Supplies

    -   Incontinence briefs and Chux Covered in the normal course of a
        visit. For example, if a home health aide in the course of a
        bathing visit to a patient determines the patient requires an
        incontinence brief change, the incontinence brief in this
        example would be covered as a routine medical supply.

E.  ### Other

    -   Thermometers; and

    -   Tongue depressors.

> There are occasions when the supplies listed in the above examples
> would be considered nonroutine and thus would be considered a billable
> supply, i.e., if they are required in quantity, for recurring need,
> and are included in the plan of care. Examples include, but are not
> limited to, tape, and 4x4s for major dressings.

# - Nonroutine Supplies (Reportable)

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> Nonroutine supplies are identified by the following conditions:

1.  The HHA follows a consistent charging practice for Medicare and
    other patients receiving the item;

2.  The item is directly identifiable to an individual patient;

3.  The cost of the item can be identified and accumulated in a separate
    cost center; and

4.  The item is furnished at the direction of the patient\'s physician
    or allowed practitioner and is specifically identified in the plan
    of care.

> All nonroutine supplies must be specifically ordered by the physician
> or allowed practitioner or the physician or allowed practitioner\'s
> order for services must require the use of the specific supplies to be
> effectively furnished.
>
> The charge for nonroutine supplies is excluded from the per visit
> costs.
>
> Examples of supplies that can be considered nonroutine include, but
> are not limited to:

1.  Dressings/Wound Care

    -   Sterile dressings;

    -   Sterile gauze and toppers;

    -   Kling and Kerlix rolls;

    -   Telfa pads;

    -   Eye pads;

    -   Sterile solutions, ointments;

    -   Sterile applicators; and

    -   Sterile gloves.

2.  I.V. Supplies

3.  Ostomy Supplies

4.  Catheters and Catheter Supplies

    -   Foley catheters; and

    -   Drainage bags, irrigation trays.

5.  []{#_bookmark79 .anchor}Enemas and Douches

6.  Syringes and Needles

7.  Home Testing

    -   Blood glucose monitoring strips; and

    -   Urine monitoring strips.

> Consider other items that are often used by persons who are not ill or
> injured to be medical supplies only where:

-   The item is recognized as having the capacity to serve a therapeutic
    or diagnostic purpose in a specific situation; and

-   The item is required as a part of the actual physician or allowed
    practitioner prescribed treatment of a patient\'s existing illness
    or injury.

> For example, items that generally serve a routine hygienic purpose,
> e.g., soaps and shampoos and items that generally serve as skin
> conditioners, e.g., baby lotion, baby oil, skin softeners, powders,
> lotions, are not considered medical supplies unless the particular
> item is recognized as serving a specific therapeutic purpose in the
> physician or allowed practitioner\'s prescribed treatment of the
> patient\'s existing skin (scalp) disease or injury.
>
> Limited amounts of medical supplies may be left in the home between
> visits where repeated applications are required and rendered by the
> patient or other caregivers. These items must be part of the plan of
> care in which the home health staff is actively involved. For example,
> the patient is independent in insulin injections but the nurse visits
> once a day to change wound dressings. The wound dressings/irrigation
> solution may be left in the home between visits. Supplies such as
> needles, syringes, and catheters that require administration by a
> nurse should not be left in the home between visits.

# - Durable Medical Equipment

# -- Covered Osteoporosis Drugs

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> Sections 1861(m) and 1861(kk) of the Act provide for coverage of FDA
> approved injectable drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis. These
> drugs are expected to be provided by an HHA to female beneficiaries
> who are currently receiving services under an open home health plan of
> care, who meet existing coverage criteria for the home health benefit
> and who meet the criteria listed below. These drugs are covered on a
> cost basis when provided by an HHA under the circumstances listed
> below.
>
> The home health visit (i.e., the skilled nurse\'s visit) to administer
> the drug is covered under all fee-for-service Medicare (Part A or Part
> B) home health coverage rules (see section 30 above). Coverage of the
> drug is limited to female beneficiaries who meet each of the following
> criteria:

-   The individual is eligible for Medicare Part B coverage of home
    health services (the nursing visit to perform the injection may be
    the individual\'s qualifying service);

-   The individual sustained a bone fracture that a physician, or
    allowed practitioner, or certified nurse midwife certifies was
    related to post-menopausal osteoporosis; and

-   The individual\'s physician, or allowed practitioner, or certified
    nurse midwife certifies that she is unable to learn the skills
    needed to self-administer the drug or is otherwise physically or
    mentally incapable of administering the drug, and that her family or
    caregivers are unable or unwilling to administer the drug.

> This drug is considered part of the home health benefit under Part B.
> Therefore, Part B deductible and coinsurance apply regardless of
> whether home health visits for the administration of the drug are
> covered under Part A or Part B.
>
> For instructions on billing for covered osteoporosis drugs, see Pub.

# - Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Using a Disposable Device

### (Rev. 265, Issued: 01-10-20, Effective: 01-01-20, Implementation: 02-11-20)

> Sections 1834 and 1861(m)(5) of the Act require a separate payment to
> an HHA for an applicable disposable device when furnished on or after
> January 1, 2017, to an individual who receives home health services
> for which payment is made under the Medicare home health benefit.
> Section 1834 of the Act defines an applicable device as a disposable
> NPWT device that is an integrated system comprised of a non-manual
> vacuum pump, a receptacle for collecting exudate, and dressings for
> the purposes of wound therapy used in lieu of a conventional NPWT DME
> system. As required by §1834 of the Act, the separate payment amount
> for a disposable NPWT device is to be set equal to the amount of the
> payment that would be made under the Medicare Hospital Outpatient
> Prospective
>
> Payment System (OPPS) using the Level I HCPCS code, otherwise referred
> to as Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, for which the
> description for a professional service includes the furnishing of such
> a device.
>
> Payment for HH visits related to wound care, but not requiring the
> furnishing of an entirely new disposable NPWT device, will be covered
> by the HH PPS 30-day period payment and must be billed using the HH
> claim. Where a home health visit is exclusively for the purpose of
> furnishing NPWT using a disposable device, the HHA will submit only a
> type of claim that will be paid for separately outside the HH PPS (TOB
> 34x). Where, however, the home health visit includes the provision of
> other home health services in addition to, and separate from,
> furnishing NPWT using a disposable device, the HHA will submit both a
> home health claim and a TOB 34x---the home health claim for other home
> health services and the TOB 34x for furnishing NPWT using a disposable
> device.

## EXAMPLE:

> A patient requires NPWT for the treatment of a wound. On Monday, a
> nurse assesses a patient's wound, applies a new disposable NPWT
> device, and provides wound care education to the patient and family.
> The nurse returns on Thursday for wound assessment and replaces the
> fluid management system (or dressing) for the existing disposable
> NPWT, but does not replace the entire device. The nurse returns the
> following Monday, assesses the patient's condition and the wound, and
> replaces the device that had been applied on the previous Monday with
> a new disposable NPWT device. In this scenario, the billing procedures
> are as follows:
>
> For both Monday visits, all the services provided by the nurse were
> associated with furnishing NPWT using a disposable device. The nurse
> did not provide any services that were not associated with furnishing
> NPWT using a disposable device. Therefore, all the nursing services
> for both Monday visits should be reported on TOB 34x with CPT code
> 97607 or 97608. None of the services should be reported on the HH
> claim.
>
> For the Thursday visit, the nurse checked the wound, but did not apply
> a new disposable NPWT device, so even though the nurse provided care
> related to the wound, those services would not be considered
> furnishing NPWT using a disposable device.
>
> Therefore, the services should be reported on bill type 32x and no
> services should be reported on bill type 34x.
>
> For instructions on billing for NPWT using a disposable device, see
> Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, chapter 10, Section
> 90.3 -- Billing Instructions for Disposable Negative Pressure Wound
> Therapy Services.

# - Part-Time or Intermittent Home Health Aide and Skilled Nursing Services

## A3-3119.7, HHA-206.7, A3-3119.7A, HHA-206.7A, A3-3119.7.B, HHA-206.7.B

> Where a patient is eligible for coverage of home health services,
> Medicare covers either part-time or intermittent home health aide
> services or skilled nursing services subject to the limits below. The
> law at
> [[§1861(m)](https://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1861.htm)]{.underline}
> of the Act clarified: \"the term \"part-time or intermittent
> services\" means skilled nursing and home health aide services
> furnished any number of days per week as long as they are furnished
> (combined) less than 8 hours each day and 28 or fewer hours each week
> (or, subject to review on a case-by-case basis as to the need for

# - Impact on Care Provided in Excess of \"Intermittent\" or \"Part-

> **Time\" Care**

### (Rev. 208, Issued: 04-22-15, Effective: 01-01-15, Implementation: 05-11-15)

> Home health aide and/or skilled nursing care, in excess of the amounts
> of care that meet the definition of part-time or intermittent, may be
> provided to a home care patient or purchased by other payers without
> bearing on whether the home health aide and skilled nursing care meets
> the Medicare definitions of part-time or intermittent.
>
> **EXAMPLE:** A patient needs skilled nursing care monthly for a
> catheter change and the home health agency also renders needed daily
> home health aide services 24 hours per day that will be needed for a
> long and indefinite period of time. The HHA bills Medicare for the
> skilled nursing and home health aide services, which were provided
> before the 35th hour of service each week, and bills the beneficiary
> (or another payer) for the remainder of the care. If the Medicare
> contractor determines that the 35 hours of care are reasonable and
> necessary, Medicare would cover the 35 hours of skilled nursing and
> home health aide visits.

# - Application of this Policy Revision

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

## A3-3119.7.D, HHA-206.7.D

> Additional care covered by other payers discussed in
> [[§50.7.1]{.underline}](#impact-on-care-provided-in-excess-of-intermittent-or-part-)
> does not affect Medicare coverage when the conditions listed below
> apply. A patient must meet the criteria for Medicare coverage of home
> health services, before this policy revision becomes applicable to
> skilled nursing services and/or home health aide services. The
> definition of \"intermittent\" with respect to the need for skilled
> nursing care where the patient qualifies for coverage based on the
> need for \"skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis\" remains
> unchanged. Specifically:

1.  This policy revision always applies to home health aide services
    when the patient qualifies for coverage;

2.  This policy revision applies to skilled nursing care only when the
    patient needs physical therapy or speech-language pathology services
    or continued occupational therapy, and also needs skilled nursing
    care; and

3.  If the patient needs skilled nursing care but does not need physical
    therapy or speech-language pathology services or occupational
    therapy, the patient must still meet the longstanding and unchanged
    definition of \"intermittent\" skilled nursing care in order to
    qualify for coverage of any home health services.

> of the Act provides post-institutional home health services for
> individuals enrolled in Part A and Part B and home health services for
> individuals who are eligible for Part A only. For beneficiaries who
> are enrolled in Part A and Part B, Part A finances post-institutional
> home health services furnished during a home health spell of illness
> for up to 100 visits during a spell of illness.
>
> Part A finances up to 100 visits furnished during a home health spell
> of illness if the following criteria are met:

-   Beneficiaries are enrolled in Part A **and** Part B and qualify to
    receive the Medicare home health benefit;

-   Beneficiaries must have at least a three consecutive day stay in a
    hospital or rural primary care hospital; and

-   Home health services must be initiated and the first covered home
    health visit must be rendered within 14 days of discharge from a 3
    consecutive day stay in a hospital or rural primary care hospital or
    within 14 days of discharge from a skilled nursing facility in which
    the individual was provided post-hospital extended care services. If
    the first home health visit is not initiated within 14 days of
    discharge, then home health services are financed under Part B.

> After an individual exhausts 100 visits of Part A post-institutional
> home health services, Part B finances the balance of the home health
> spell of illness. A home health spell of illness is a period of
> consecutive days beginning with the first day not included in a
> previous home health spell of illness on which the individual is
> furnished post- institutional home health services which occurs in a
> month the individual is entitled to Part A. The home health spell of
> illness ends with the close of the first period of 60 consecutive days
> in which the individual is neither an inpatient of a hospital or rural
> primary care hospital nor an inpatient of a skilled nursing facility
> (in which the individual was furnished post-hospital extended care
> services) nor provided home health services.

## EXAMPLE 1:

> An individual is enrolled in Part A and Part B, qualifies for the
> Medicare home health benefit, has a three consecutive day stay in a
> hospital, and is discharged on May 1. On May 5, the individual
> receives the first skilled nursing visit under the plan of care.
>
> Therefore, post-institutional home health services have been initiated
> within 14 days of discharge. The individual is later hospitalized on
> June 2. Prior to the June 2 hospitalization, the individual received
> 12 home health visits. The individual stays in the hospital for four
> consecutive days, is discharged and receives home health services.
> That
>
> individual continues the May 5 home health spell of illness and would
> have 88 visits left under that home health spell of illness under Part
> A. That individual could not start another home health spell of
> illness (100 visits under Part A) until a 60-day consecutive period in
> which the individual was not an inpatient of a hospital, rural primary
> care hospital, an inpatient of a skilled nursing facility (in which
> the individual was furnished post-hospital extended care services), or
> provided home health services had passed.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> An individual is enrolled in Part A and Part B, qualifies for the
> Medicare home health benefit, has a three consecutive day stay in a
> hospital, and home health is initiated within 14 days of discharge.
> The individual exhausts the 100 visits under Part A post-
> institutional home health services, continues to need home health
> services, and receives home health services under Part B. The
> individual is then hospitalized for 4 consecutive days. The individual
> is again discharged and receives home health services. The individual
> cannot begin a new home health spell of illness because 60 days did
> not pass in which the individual was not an inpatient of a hospital or
> rural primary care hospital or an inpatient of a skilled nursing
> facility in which the individual was furnished post- hospital extended
> care services. The individual would be discharged and Part B would
> continue to finance the home health services.

# - Beneficiaries Who Are Enrolled in Part A and Part B, but Do Not Meet Threshold for Post-Institutional Home Health Services

## A3-3122.1, HHA-212.3

> If beneficiaries are enrolled in Part A and Part B and are eligible
> for the Medicare home health benefit, but do not meet the three
> consecutive day stay requirement or the 14 day initiation of care
> requirement, then all of their home health services would be financed
> under Part B. For example, this situation would include, but is not

## A3-3122.1, HHA-212.4

> If a beneficiary is enrolled **only** in Part A and qualifies for the
> Medicare home health benefit, then all of the home health services are
> financed under Part A. The 100-visit limit does **not** apply to
> beneficiaries who are only enrolled in Part A. If a beneficiary is
> enrolled **only** in Part B and qualifies for the Medicare home health

# - Counting Visits Under the Hospital and Medical Plans

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

A.  **Visit Defined**

> A visit is an episode of personal contact with the patient by staff of
> the HHA, or others under arrangements with the HHA, for the purpose of
> providing a covered home health service. Though visits are provided
> under the HH benefit as part of 30-day periods, and periods are
> unlimited, each visit must be uniquely billed as a separate line item
> on a Medicare HH claim, and data on visit charges is still used in
> formulating payment rates.

### Counting Visits

> Generally, one visit may be covered each time an HHA employee, or
> someone providing home health services under arrangements with the
> HHA, enters the patient\'s home and provides a covered service to a
> patient who meets the criteria in
> [[§30]{.underline}.](#conditions-patient-must-meet-to-qualify-for-coverage-of-home-health-services)
>
> If the HHA furnishes services in an outpatient facility under
> arrangements with the facility, one visit may be covered for each type
> of service provided.
>
> If two individuals are needed to provide a service, two visits may be
> covered. If two individuals are present, but only one is needed to
> provide the care, only one visit may be covered.
>
> A visit is initiated with the delivery of covered home health services
> and ends at the conclusion of delivery of covered home health
> services. In those circumstances in which all reasonable and necessary
> home health services cannot be provided in the course of a single
> visit, HHA staff or others providing services under arrangements with
> the HHA may remain at the patient\'s home between visits (e.g., to
> provide noncovered services).
>
> However, if all covered services could be provided in the course of
> one visit, only one visit may be covered.

## EXAMPLES:

1.  If an occupational therapist and an occupational therapy assistant
    visit the patient together to provide therapy and the therapist is
    there to supervise the assistant, **one** visit is counted.

2.  If a nurse visits the patient in the morning to dress a wound and
    later must return to replace a catheter, **two** visits are counted.

3.  If the therapist visits the patient for treatment in the morning and
    the patient is later visited by the assistant for additional
    treatment, **two** visits are counted.

4.  If an individual is taken to a hospital to receive outpatient
    therapy that could not be furnished in their own home (e.g.,
    hydrotherapy) and, while at the hospital receives speech-language
    pathology services and other services, **two or more** visits would
    be charged.

5.  Many home health agencies provide home health aide services on an
    hourly basis (ranging from 1 to 8 hours a day). However, in order to
    allocate visits properly against a patient\'s maximum allowable
    visits, home health aide services are to be counted in terms of
    visits. Thus, regardless of the number of continuous hours a home
    health aide spends in a patient\'s home on any given day, one
    \"visit\" is counted for each such day. If, in a rare situation, a
    home health aide visits a patient for an hour or two in the morning,
    and again for an hour or two in the afternoon, two visits are
    counted.

### Evaluation Visits

> The HHAs are required by regulations to have written policies
> concerning the acceptance of patients by the agency. These include
> consideration of the physical facilities available in the patient\'s
> place of residence, the homebound status, and the attitudes of family
> members for the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of meeting the
> patient\'s medical needs in the home health setting. When personnel of
> the agency make such an initial evaluation visit, the cost of the
> visit is considered an administrative cost of the agency and is not
> chargeable as a visit since at this point the patient has not been
> accepted for care. If, however, during the course of this initial
> evaluation visit, the patient is determined suitable for home health
> care by the agency, and is also furnished the first skilled service as
> ordered under the physician or allowed practitioner\'s plan of care,
> the visit would become the first billable visit in the 30-day period.
>
> The Medicare contractor will cover an observation and evaluation (or
> reevaluation) visit made by a nurse (see
> [[§40.1.2.1]{.underline}](#observation-and-assessment-of-the-patients-condition-when-only-the-specialized-skills-of-a-medical-professional-can-determine-patients-status)
> for a further discussion of skilled nursing observation and evaluation
> visits) or other appropriate personnel, ordered by the physician or
> allowed practitioner for the purpose of evaluating the patient\'s
> condition and continuing need for skilled services, as a skilled
> visit.
>
> A supervisory visit made by a nurse or other appropriate personnel (as
> required by the conditions of participation) to evaluate the specific
> personal care needs of the patient or to review the manner in which
> the personal care needs of the patient are being met by the aide is an
> administrative function, not a skilled visit.

> receiving items and services under the home health benefit that are
> not related to ESRD.

# - Prosthetic Devices

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

## A3-3125F, HHA-230F

# - Respiratory Care Services

### (Rev. 265, Issued: 01-10-20, Effective: 01-01-20, Implementation: 02-11-20)

> If a respiratory therapist is used to furnish overall training or
> consultative advice to HHA staff and incidentally furnishes
> respiratory therapy services to patients in their homes, the costs of
> the respiratory therapist\'s services are allowable only as
> administrative costs to the HHA. Visits by a respiratory therapist to

> care when a HH plan of care is in effect. However, respiratory therapy
> services furnished as part of a plan of care other than a home health
> plan of care by a licensed nurse or physical therapist and that
> constitute skilled care may be covered and separately billed as
> skilled visits when the beneficiary is not in a home health period of
> care. Note that Medicare billing does not recognize respiratory
> therapy as a separate discipline, but rather sees the services in
> accordance with the revenue code used on the claims (i.e. 042x).

# - Dietary and Nutrition Personnel

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

## A3-3125.I, HHA-230.I

# - Telecommunications Technology

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> Telecommunications technology (other than audio-only telephone calls)
> can include: remote patient monitoring, defined as the collection of
> physiologic data (for example, ECG, blood pressure, glucose
> monitoring) digitally stored and/or transmitted by the patient or
> caregiver or both to the home health agency; teletypewriter (TTY)
> technology; and 2-way audio-video telecommunications technology that
> allows for real-time interaction between the patient and clinician.
> Telecommunications technology can be ordered as part of a home health
> plan of care but such services cannot be reported as a visit without
> the provision of another skilled service. If telecommunications
> technologies
>
> are used by the home health agency, the costs of any equipment,
> set-up, and service related to the technology are allowable only as
> administrative costs. Visits to a beneficiary\'s home for the sole
> purpose of supplying, connecting, or training the patient on the
> technology, without the provision of a skilled service, are not
> separately billable. However, HHAs may include the costs of
> telecommunications technology as an allowable administrative cost

# 90 - Medical and Other Health Services Furnished by Home Health Agencies

### (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)

> Payment may be made by Medicare contractors to a home health agency
> which furnishes either directly or under arrangements with others the
> following \"medical and other health services\" to beneficiaries with
> Part B coverage in accordance with Part B billing and payment rules
> other than when a home health plan of care is in effect.

1.  Surgical dressings (for a patient who is not under a home health
    plan of care), and splints, casts, and other devices used for
    reduction of fractures and dislocations;

2.  Prosthetic (Except for items excluded from the term \"orthotics and
    prosthetics\" in accordance with
    [[§1834(h)(4)(C)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/)
    of the Act for patients who are under a home health plan of care);

3.  Leg, arm, back, and neck braces, trusses, and artificial legs, arms,
    and eyes and adjustments to these items when ordered by a physician
    or allowed practitioner. (See Pub 100-02, Medicare Benefit Policy
    Manual, Chapter 15);

4.  Outpatient physical therapy, outpatient occupational therapy, and
    outpatient speech-language pathology services (for a patient not
    under a home health plan of care). (See Pub 100-02, Medicare Benefit
    Policy Manual, Chapter 15); and

5.  Rental and purchase of durable medical equipment. (See Pub 100-02,
    Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15.) If a beneficiary meets
    all of the criteria for coverage of home health services and the HHA
    is providing home health care under the Hospital Insurance Program
    (Part A), any DME provided and billed to the Medicare contractor by
    the HHA to that patient must also be provided under Part A. Where
    the patient meets the criteria for coverage of home health services
    and the HHA is providing the home health care under the
    Supplementary Medical Insurance Program (Part B) because the patient
    is not eligible for Part A, the DME provided by the HHA may, at the
    beneficiary\'s option, be furnished under the Part B home health
    benefit or as a medical and other health service. Irrespective of
    how the DME is furnished, the beneficiary is responsible for a 20
    percent coinsurance.

6.  Ambulance service. (See Pub 100-02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual,
    Chapter 10, Ambulance Services)

7.  Hepatitis B Vaccine. Hepatitis B vaccine and its administration are
    covered under Part B for patients who are at high or intermediate
    risk of contracting hepatitis B. High risk groups currently
    identified include: end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients,
    hemophiliacs who receive factor VIII or IX concentrates, clients of
    institutions for the mentally retarded, persons who live in the same
    household as a hepatitis B virus carrier, homosexual men, illicit
    injectable drug users. Intermediate risk groups currently identified
    include staff in institutions for the mentally retarded, workers in
    health care professions who have frequent contact with blood or
    blood-derived body fluids during routine work. Persons in the above
    listed groups would not be considered at high or intermediate risk
    of contracting hepatitis B, however, if there is laboratory evidence
    positive for antibodies to hepatitis B. ESRD patients are routinely
    tested for hepatitis B antibodies as part of their continuing
    monitoring and therapy. The vaccine may be administered, upon the
    order of a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, by home health
    agencies.

8.  Hemophilia clotting factors. Blood clotting factors for hemophilia
    patients competent to use such factors to control bleeding without
    medical or other supervision and items related to the administration
    of such factors are covered under Part B.

9.  Pneumococcal and influenza vaccines. See Pub 100-02, Medicare
    Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, "Covered Medical and Other Health
    Services," §50.4.2 "Immunizations."

10. Splints, casts. See Pub 100-02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual,
    Chapter 15, "Covered Medical and Other Health Services."

11. Antigens. See Pub 100-02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter
    15, "Covered Medical and Other Health Services."

> This provision does not provide coverage or payment for Medicare home
