# -- Anti-Markup Payment Limitation

## (Rev. 1931, Issued: 03-12-10, Effective: 06-14-10, Implementation: 06-14-10)

> Section [1842(n)](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/)(1) of the
> Social Security Act (the Act) establishes payment rules for certain
> diagnostic tests (other than clinical diagnostic laboratory tests)
> where the physician performing or supervising the test does not share
> a practice with the billing physician or other supplier. Examples of
> tests covered under this rule include, but are not limited to: x-rays,
> EKGs, EEGs, cardiac monitoring, and ultrasound services furnished on
> or after January 1, 1994. (Note that screening mammography services
> are covered under another provision of the Act and are not subject to
> the anti-markup payment limitation.) The anti- markup payment
> limitation applies to the technical component or "TC" of certain
> diagnostic tests that are payable on the Medicare Physician Fee
> Schedule (MPFS). Effective January 1, 2009, the anti- markup payment
> limitation also applies to the professional component or ("PC") of
> diagnostic tests (other than clinical diagnostic tests). The
> anti-markup payment limitation only applies when a physician (or other
> supplier) orders and bills for a diagnostic test in which the TC or PC
> is performed by a physician who does not "share a practice" with the
> ordering/billing physician (or other supplier). For more information
> on the anti-markup payment limitation, see chapter 1, §30.2.9.

1.  **--** A/B MAC (B) **Payment Rules**

## (Rev. 1931, Issued: 03-12-10, Effective: 06-14-10, Implementation: 06-14-10)

> If a diagnostic test (other than a clinical diagnostic laboratory
> test) is personally performed or is supervised by a physician, such
> physician may bill under the normal physician fee schedule rules. This
> includes situations in which the test is performed or supervised by
> another physician with whom the billing physician shares a practice
> (see Pub. 100-04, chapter 1, §30.2.9). Section 80, chapter 15, of Pub.
> 100-02, Medicare Benefit Policy, sets forth the various levels of
> physician supervision required for diagnostic tests. The supervision
> requirement for physician billing is [not]{.underline} met when the
> test is administered by supplier personnel regardless of whether the
> test is performed at the physician\'s office or at another location.
>
> If a physician bills for a diagnostic test that is subject to the
> anti-markup payment limitation, the fee schedule amount for the
> acquired service equals the lower of:

-   The performing physician or other supplier's net charge to the
    > billing physician or other supplier for performing the service;

-   The billing physician or other supplier's actual charge; or

-   The fee schedule amount allowed for the jurisdiction where the
    > service was performed.

> The lowest figure is the fee schedule amount for purposes of the
> limiting charge. (See chapter 1,
>
> §30.3.12.1 of this publication) The billing entity must identify the
> performing physician or other supplier (including the performing
> provider's NPI) and the amount the performing physician or other
> supplier charged the billing entity (net of any discounts). A
> physician who accepts assignment is permitted to bill and collect from
> the beneficiary only the applicable deductible and coinsurance for the
> acquired test. A physician who does not accept assignment is permitted
> to bill and collect from the beneficiary only the fee schedule amount
> (as defined above) for the acquired test. The limiting charge
> provision is not applicable.
>
> If the physician does not identify who performed the test and provide
> the other required information, no payment is allowed. The physician
> may not bill the beneficiary any amount for the test.

# - Billing for Services

## (Rev. 1931, Issued: 03-12-10, Effective: 06-14-10, Implementation: 06-14-10)

> A physician or other supplier may bill and receive Part B payment for
> the technical component (TC) or professional component (PC) of
> diagnostic tests which the physician or other supplier contracts a
> physician, medical group, or other supplier to perform. (This claim
> and payment procedure does not extend to clinical diagnostic
> laboratory tests.) The anti-markup rule will apply to the TC or PC of
> diagnostic tests that have been ordered by the billing physician or
> other supplier (or by a party financially related to the billing
> physician or other supplier through common ownership or control) if
> the performing physician or other supplier does not meet the criteria
> for "sharing a practice" with the ordering/billing entity. An example
> is when the attending physician orders radiology tests from a
> radiologist and the radiologist purchases the tests from an imaging
> center with whom the radiologist does not meet the criteria for
> "sharing a practice." Under the anti-markup payment limitation, the
> billing physician or other supplier may not mark up the charge for a
> test from the acquisition price and must accept as full payment for
> the test (even if assignment is not accepted) the lowest of: the fee
> schedule amount as if the performing physician or other supplier had
> billed directly, the billing entity's actual charge, or the performing
> physician or other supplier's net charge to the billing entity. The
> billing physician or other supplier must be financially related to the
> physician or group that ordered the tests through common ownership or
> control.
>
> If the performing physician or other supplier meets the criteria for
> "sharing a practice" with the billing physician or other supplier,
> then the anti-markup payment limitation will not apply and the lower
> of the physician fee schedule amount or the billed amount will be
> paid.
>
> The physician or other supplier that performed the component that is
> subject to the anti-markup rule must be enrolled in the Medicare
> program. No formal reassignment is necessary; however, reassigned
> services are also subject to the anti-markup payment limitation.

## Radiology Services

> Contractors shall apply the anti-markup payment limitation to the TC
> and PC of radiology diagnostic testing services other than screening
> mammography procedures. See Publication 100-04, chapter 1,
>
> §30.2.9 for more information on the anti-markup payment limitation.

## Payment to a Physician or Other Supplier of Diagnostic Tests for Services Subject to the Anti- Markup Payment Limitation

> A physician or other supplier that provides diagnostic tests may bill
> and receive the Part B payment for the TC or PC of diagnostic tests
> which that physician or other supplier acquires from another
> physician, medical group, or other supplier. If the performing
> physician does not meet the requirements for sharing a practice with
> the ordering/billing physician or other supplier, then the anti-markup
> payment limitation rules will apply. (See section 30.2.9 of this
> chapter for more information.) If the performing physician is deemed
> to share a practice with the physician or other supplier that ordered
> the test, then the physician fee schedule amount may be billed and the
> anti-markup payment limitation will not apply. In either case, the
> performing physician or other supplier must be enrolled in the
> Medicare program. No formal reassignment is necessary; however, the
> anti-markup payment limitation will apply to reassigned services.
>
> If the anti-markup rules apply, payment may not exceed the lowest of
> the following amounts:

-   The performing physician or other supplier's net charge to the
    > billing physician or other supplier;\*

-   The billing physician or other supplier's actual charges; or

-   The fee schedule amount allowed for the test if the performing
    > physician or other supplier billed directly.

> \*The net charge must be determined without regard to any charge that
> is intended to reflect the cost of equipment or space leased to the
> performing physician or supplier by or through the billing entity. For
> more information, see Pub. 100-04, chapter 1, §30.2.9.
>
> The billing physician or other supplier must keep on file the name,
> address, and NPI of the physician or other supplier who performed the
> anti-markup service.

## Sanctions

> Physicians who knowingly and willfully, in repeated cases, bill
> Medicare beneficiaries amounts beyond those outlined in this chapter
> are subject to the penalties contained under
> [§1842(j)(2)](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of the Act.
>
> Penalties are assigned after post-pay review depending on the
> severity.

## Questionable Business Arrangements

> No special charge or payment constraints are imposed on tests
> performed by a physician or a technician under the physician's
> supervision. There are two requirements for all diagnostic tests under
> §1861(s)(3) of the Act, as implemented by 42 CFR §410.32 and section
> 10 of chapter13 of this publication and section 80, chapter 15 of Pub.
> 100-02BP. Namely, the test must be ordered by the treating
> practitioner, and the test must be supervised by a physician. However,
> attempts may be made by the medical diagnostic community to adjust or
> establish arrangements which continue to allow physicians to profit
> from other\'s work or by creating the appearance that the physician
> has performed or supervised his/her technicians who are employed,
> contracted, or leased. Some of these arrangements may involve cardiac
> scanning services and mobile ultrasound companies leasing their
> equipment to physicians for the day the equipment is used, and hiring
> out their staff to the physicians to meet the supervision requirement.
>
> The bona fides of such arrangements may be suspect and could be an
> attempt to circumvent the anti- markup payment limitation. If you have
> any doubt that a particular arrangement is a valid relationship where
> the physician is performing or supervising the services, this should
> be investigated. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has
> responsibility for investigating violations of
> [§1842(n)](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of the Act.
>
> Another arrangement to circumvent the anti-markup payment limitation
> is for the ordering physician to reassign his/her payment for the
> interpretation of the test to the supplier. The supplier, in turn,
> bills for both the test and the interpretation and pays the ordering
> physician a fee for the interpretation. This arrangement violates
> §1842(b)(6) of the Act, which prohibits Medicare from paying benefits
> due the person that furnished the service to any other person, subject
> to limited exceptions discussed in Pub.
>
> 100-04, chapter 1, §30.2.2. Also, this arrangement could constitute a
> violation of §1128 B (b) of the Act, which prohibits remuneration for
> referrals (i.e., kickbacks).
>
> Violations of §1128B (b) of the Act may subject the physician or
> supplier to criminal penalties or exclusion from the Medicare and
> Medicaid programs. Illegal remuneration for referrals can be found
> even when the ordering physician performs some service for the
> remuneration.

# - SNF Billing and A/B MAC (A) Payment for Contrast Material Other Than Low Osmolar Contrast Material (LOCM) (Radiology)

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> When a radiology procedure is provided with contrast material, a SNF
> should bill using the CPT-4 code that indicates "with" contrast
> material. If the coding does not distinguish between "with" and
> "without" contrast material, the SNF should use the available code.
>
> Contrast material other than LOCM may be billed separately in addition
> to the radiology procedure, or it may be billed as part of the amount
> for the radiology procedure. If the SNF bills separately for the
> contrast material and the charge for the procedure includes a charge
> for contrast material, the SNF must adjust the charge for the
> procedure to exclude any amount for the contrast material. Regardless
> of the billing method used, charges are subject to the fee schedule.
>
> When billing separately for this contrast material, the SNF should use
> revenue code 0255 (drugs incident to radiology and subject to the
> payment limit) and report the charge on the same bill as the radiology
> procedure. The A/B MAC (A) will not accept late charge bills for this
> service.

> **Effective September 28, 2009**
>
> The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) finds that the
> non-coverage of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for blood flow
> determination is no longer supported by the available evidence. CMS is
> removing the phrase "blood flow measurement" and local Medicare
> contractors will have the discretion to cover (or not cover).
>
> Consult Publication (Pub.) 100-03, National Coverage Determinations
> (NCD) Manual, chapter 1, section 220.2, for specific coverage and
> non-coverage indications associated with MRI and MRA (Magnetic
> Resonance Angiography).

## Prior to January 1, 2007

> A/B MACs (B) do not make additional payments for three or more MRI
> sequences. The relative value units (RVUs) reflect payment levels for
> two sequences.
>
> The technical component (TC) RVUs for MRI procedures that specify
> "with contrast" include payment for paramagnetic contrast media. A/B
> MACs (B) do not make separate payment under code A4647.
>
> A diagnostic technique has been developed under which an MRI of the
> brain or spine is first performed without contrast material, then
> another MRI is performed with a standard (0.1mmol/kg) dose of contrast
> material and, based on the need to achieve a better image, a third MRI
> is performed with an additional double dosage (0.2mmol/kg) of contrast
> material. When the high-dose contrast technique is utilized, A/B MACs
> (B):

-   Do not pay separately for the contrast material used in the second
    > MRI procedure;

-   Pay for the contrast material given for the third MRI procedure
    > through supply code Q9952, the replacement code for A4643, when
    > billed with Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes 70553,
    > 72156, 72157, and 72158;

-   Do not pay for the third MRI procedure. For example, in the case of
    > an MRI of the brain, if CPT code 70553 (without contrast material,
    > followed by with contrast material(s) and further sequences) is
    > billed, make no payment for CPT code 70551 (without contrast
    > material(s)), the additional procedure given for the purpose of
    > administering the double dosage, furnished during the same
    > session. Medicare does not pay for the third procedure (as
    > distinguished from the contrast material) because the CPT
    > definition of code 70553 includes all further sequences; and

-   Do not apply the payment criteria for low osmolar contrast media in
    > [§30.1.2](#payment-level) to billings for code Q9952, the
    > replacement code for A4643.

## Effective January 1, 2007

> With the implementation for calendar year 2007 of a bottom-up
> methodology, which utilizes the direct inputs to determine the
> practice expense (PE) relative value units (RVUs), the cost of the
> contrast media is not included in the PE RVUs. Therefore, a separate
> payment for the contrast media used in various imaging procedures is
> paid. In addition to the CPT code representing the imaging procedure,
> separately bill the appropriate HCPCS "Q" code (Q9945 -- Q9954;
> Q9958-Q9964) for the contrast medium utilized in performing the
> service.

## Effective February 24, 2011

> Medicare will allow for coverage of MRI for beneficiaries with
> implanted PMs or cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) for use in an MRI

## Effective July 7, 2011

> Medicare will allow for coverage of MRI for beneficiaries with
> implanted pacemakers (PMs) when the PMs are used according to the Food
> and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved labeling for use in an MRI

> used as a substitute for contrast angiography, except to the extent
> that there are documented circumstances consistent with that
> instruction that demonstrates the medical necessity of both tests.

## (Rev. 1833; Issued: 10-16-09; Effective Date: 04-03-09; Implementation Date: 10-30-09)

> Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive imaging procedure
> that assesses perfusion and the level of metabolic activity in various
> organ systems of the human body. A positron camera (tomograph) is used
> to produce cross-sectional tomographic images which are obtained by
> detecting radioactivity from a radioactive tracer substance
> (radiopharmaceutical) that emits a radioactive tracer substance
> (radiopharmaceutical FDG) such as 2 --\[F-18\] flouro-D-glucose FDG,
> that is administered intravenously to the patient.
>
> The Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Manual, chapter 1,
> §220.6, contains additional coverage instructions to indicate the
> conditions under which a PET scan is performed.

## Definitions

> For all uses of PET, excluding Rubidium 82 for perfusion of the heart,
> myocardial viability and refractory seizures, the following
> definitions apply:

-   **Diagnosis**: PET is covered only in clinical situations in which
    the PET results may assist in avoiding an invasive diagnostic
    procedure, or in which the PET results may assist in determining the
    optimal anatomical location to perform an invasive diagnostic
    procedure. In general, for most solid

> tumors, a tissue diagnosis is made prior to the performance of PET
> scanning. PET scans following a tissue diagnosis are generally
> performed for the purpose of staging, rather than diagnosis.
> Therefore, the use of PET in the diagnosis of lymphoma, esophageal and
> colorectal cancers, as well as in melanoma, should be rare. PET is not
> covered for other diagnostic uses, and is not covered for screening
> (testing of patients without specific signs and symptoms of disease).

-   **Staging**: PET is covered in clinical situations in which (1) (a)
    the stage of the cancer remains in doubt after completion of a
    standard diagnostic workup, including conventional imaging (computed
    tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound) or, (b) the
    use of PET would also be considered reasonable and necessary if it
    could potentially replace one or more conventional imaging studies
    when it is expected that conventional study information is
    insufficient for the clinical management of the patient and, (2)
    clinical management of the patient would differ depending on the
    stage of the cancer identified.

> **NOTE:** Effective for services on or after April 3, 2009, the terms
> "diagnosis" and "staging" will be replaced with "Initial Treatment
> Strategy." For further information on this new term, refer to Pub.
> 100- 03, NCD Manual, section 220.6.17.

-   **Restaging**: PET will be covered for restaging: (1) after the
    completion of treatment for the purpose of detecting residual
    disease, (2) for detecting suspected recurrence, or metastasis, (3)
    to determine the extent of a known recurrence, or (4) if it could
    potentially replace one or more conventional imaging studies when it
    is expected that conventional study information is to determine the
    extent of a known recurrence, or if study information is
    insufficient for the clinical management of the patient. Restaging
    applies to testing after a course of treatment is completed and is
    covered subject to the conditions above.

-   **Monitoring**: Use of PET to monitor tumor response to treatment
    during the planned course of therapy (i.e., when a change in therapy
    is anticipated).

> **NOTE:** Effective for services on or after April 3, 2009, the terms
> "restaging" and "monitoring" will be replaced with "Subsequent
> Treatment Strategy." For further information on this new term, refer
> to Pub. 100-03, NCD Manual, section 220.6.17.

## Limitations

> For staging and restaging: PET is covered in either/or both of the
> following circumstances:

-   The stage of the cancer remains in doubt after completion of a
    standard diagnostic workup, including conventional imaging (computed
    tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound); and/or

-   The clinical management of the patient would differ depending on the
    stage of the cancer identified. PET will be covered for restaging
    after the completion of treatment for the purpose of detecting
    residual disease, for detecting suspected recurrence, or to
    determine the extent of a known recurrence. Use of PET would also be
    considered reasonable and necessary if it could potentially replace
    one or more conventional imaging studies when it is expected that
    conventional study information is insufficient for the clinical
    management of the patient.

> The PET is not covered for other diagnostic uses, and is not covered
> for screening (testing of patients without specific symptoms). Use of
> PET to monitor tumor response during the planned course of therapy
> (i.e., when no change in therapy is being contemplated) is not
> covered.

-   under OPPS for hospitals subject to OPPS

-   under current payment methodologies for hospitals not subject to
    > OPPS

-   on a reasonable cost basis for critical access hospitals.

-   on a reasonable cost basis for skilled nursing facilities.

> Institutional providers bill these codes under Revenue Code 0404 (PET

> services are paid at 115% of the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Data
> Base.

## Frequency

> In the absence of national frequency limitations, for all indications
> covered on and after July 1, 2001, contractors can, if necessary,
> develop frequency limitations on any or all covered PET scan services.

## Post-Payment Review for PET Scans

> As with any claim, but particularly in view of the limitations on this
> coverage, Medicare may decide to conduct post-payment reviews to
> determine that the use of PET scans is consistent with coverage
> instructions. Pet scanning facilities must keep patient record
> information on file for each Medicare patient for whom a PET scan
> claim is made. These medical records can be used in any post-payment
> reviews and must include the information necessary to substantiate the
> need for the PET scan. These records must include standard information
> (e.g., age, sex, and height) along with sufficient patient histories
> to allow determination that the steps required in the coverage
> instructions were followed. Such information must include, but is not
> limited to, the date, place and results of previous diagnostic tests
> (e.g., cytopathology and surgical pathology reports, CT), as well as
> the results and reports of the PET scan(s) performed at the center. If
> available, such records should include the prognosis derived from the
> PET scan, together with information regarding the physician or
> institution to which the patient proceeded following the scan for
> treatment or evaluation. The ordering physician is responsible for
> forwarding appropriate clinical data to the PET scan facility.
>
> Effective for claims received on or after July 1, 2001, CMS no longer
> requires paper documentation to be submitted up front with PET scan
> claims. Contractors shall be aware and advise providers of the
> specific documentation requirements for PET scans for dementia and
> neurodegenerative diseases. This information is outlined in section
> 60.12. Documentation requirements such as physician referral and
> medical necessity determination are to be maintained by the provider
> as part of the beneficiary's medical record. This information must be
> made available to the A/B MAC (A or B) upon request of additional
> documentation to determine appropriate payment of an individual claim.

# - Tracer Codes Required for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scans

## (Rev.10881; Issued: 08-06-2021; Effective: 09-07-2021; Implementation: 09-07- 2021)

> An applicable tracer/radiopharmaceutical code, along with an
> applicable Current Procedural Technology (CPT) code, is necessary for
> claims processing of any Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan
> services. While there are a number of PET tracers already billable for

> time- intensive. To help alleviate inordinate spans of time between
> when a national coverage determination is made, or when the Food and
> Drug Administration (FDA) approves a particular radiopharmaceutical
> for an oncologic indication already approved by the Centers for
> Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and when it can be fully
> implemented via valid claims processing, CMS has created two new PET
> radiopharmaceutical unclassified tracer codes that can be used
> temporarily. This time period would be pending the
> creation/approval/implementation of permanent CPT codes that would
> later specifically define their function by CMS in official
> instructions.
>
> Effective with dates of service on or after January 1, 2018, the

> circumstances that would warrant use of the
>
> below codes: (1) After FDA approval of a PET oncologic indication, or,
> (2) after CMS approves coverage of a new PET indication, and ONLY if

# - PET Scans for Imaging of the Perfusion of the Heart Using Rubidium 82 (Rb 82)

## (Rev. 223, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable)

> For dates of service on or after March 14, 1995, Medicare covers one
> PET scan for imaging of the perfusion of the heart using Rubidium 82
> (Rb 82), provided that the following conditions are met:

-   The PET is done at a PET imaging center with a PET scanner that has
    > been approved by the FDA;

-   The PET scan is a rest alone or rest with pharmacologic stress PET
    > scan, used for noninvasive imaging of the perfusion of the heart
    > for the diagnosis and management of patients with known or
    > suspected coronary artery disease, using Rb 82; and

-   Either the PET scan is used in place of, but not in addition to, a
    > single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or the PET scan
    > is used following a SPECT that was found inconclusive.

> are covered only when using the radiopharmaceutical FDG-
> (2-\[flourine-18\]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose), and are further
> predicated on the legal availability of FDG for use in such scans.

# - Expanded Coverage of PET Scans Effective for Services on or After July 1, 2001

## (Rev. 223, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable)

> See the Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual, section
> 220.6, for specific coverage criteria for PET Scans. Coverage is
> expanded for PET scans to include the following effective July 1,
> 2001:

-   Scans performed with dedicated full-ring scanners will be covered.
    Gamma camera systems with at least a 1 inch thick crystal are
    eligible for coverage in addition to those already approved by CMS
    (FDA approved);

-   The provider must maintain on file the doctor's referral and
    documentation that the procedure involved:

    -   Only FDA approved drugs and devices and,

    -   Did not involve investigational drugs, or procedures using
        investigational drugs, as determined by the FDA;

-   The ordering physician is responsible for certifying the medical
    necessity of the study according to the conditions. The physician
    must have documentation in the beneficiary's medical record to
    support the referral supplied to the PET scan provider.

> The following is a brief summary of the expanded coverage as of July
> 1, 2001:

-   PET is covered for diagnosis, initial staging and restaging of
    non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

-   Usage of PET for colorectal cancer has been expanded to include
    diagnosis, staging, and restaging.

-   Usage of PET for the initial staging, and restaging of both
    > Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's disease.

-   Usage of PET for the diagnosis, initial staging, and restaging of
    melanoma. **(PET Scans are NOT covered for the evaluation of
    regional nodes.)**

-   Medicare covers PET for the diagnosis, initial staging, and
    > restaging of esophageal cancer.

-   Usage of PET for Head and Neck Cancers. **(PET scans for head and
    neck cancer is NOT covered for central nervous system or thyroid
    cancers.)**

-   Usage of PET following an inconclusive single photon emission
    computed tomography (SPECT) only for myocardial viability. In the
    event that a patient has received a SPECT and the physician finds
    the results to be inconclusive, only then may a PET scan be ordered
    utilizing the proper documentation.

-   Usage of PET for pre-surgical evaluation for patients with
    > refractory seizures.

> **NOTE:** Effective January 1, 2002, the definitions of HCPCS Codes
> G0210 through G0230 have been updated to properly reflect the type of

# - Radiation Oncology (Therapeutic Radiology)

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

# - Weekly Radiation Therapy Management (CPT 77419 - 77430)

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> A/B MACs (B) must pay for a physician's weekly treatment management
> services under code 77427. Billing entities must indicate on each
> claim the number of fractions for which payment is sought.
>
> A weekly unit of treatment management is equal to five fractions or
> treatment sessions. A week for the purpose of making payments under
> these codes is comprised of five fractions regardless of the actual
> time period in which the services are furnished. It is not necessary
> that the radiation therapist personally examine the patient during
> each fraction for the weekly treatment management code to be payable.
> Multiple fractions representing two or more treatment sessions
> furnished on the same day may be counted as long as there has been a
> distinct break in therapy sessions, and the fractions are of the
> character usually furnished on different days. If, at the final
> billing of the treatment course, there are three or four fractions
> beyond a multiple of five, those three or four fractions are paid for
> as a week. If there are one or two fractions beyond a multiple of
> five, payment for these services is considered as having been made
> through prior payments.

**EXAMPLE:** 18 fractions = 4 weekly services

62 fractions = 12 weekly services

> 8 fractions = 2 weekly services
>
> 6 fractions = 1 weekly service
>
> If billings have occurred which indicate that the treatment course has
> ended (and, therefore, the number of residual fractions has been
> determined), but treatments resume, adjust A/B MAC (B) payments for
> the additional services consistent with the above policy.
>
> **EXAMPLE:** 8 fractions = payment for 2 weeks
>
> 2 additional fractions are furnished by the same physician. No
> additional Medicare payment is made for the 2 additional fractions.

## A. SNF Treatment Management Delivery Services

> A SNF may not bill weekly treatment management services for its
> outpatients (codes 77419, 77420, 77425, 77430, and 77431). Instead,
> the SNF should bill for radiation
>
> treatment delivery (codes 77401 - 77404, 77406 - 77409, 77411 - 77414,
> and 77416). Also, SNFs bill for therapeutic radiology port film (code
> 77417), which was previously a part of the weekly services. They enter
> the number of services in the units field.

# - Radiation Treatment Delivery (CPT 77401 - 77417)

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> A/B MACs (B) pay for these TC services on a daily basis under CPT
> codes 77401-77416 for radiation treatment delivery. They do not use
> local codes and RVUs in paying for the TC of radiation oncology
> services. Multiple treatment sessions on the same day are payable as
> long as there has been a distinct break in therapy services, and the
> individual sessions are of the character usually furnished on
> different days. A/B MACs (B) pay for CPT code 77417 (Therapeutic
> radiology port film(s)) on a weekly (five fractions) basis.

# - Clinical Brachytherapy (CPT Codes 77750 - 77799)

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> A/B MACs (B) must apply the bundled services policy to procedures in
> this family of codes other than CPT code 77776. For procedures
> furnished in settings in which TC payments are made, A/B MACs (B) must
> pay separately for the expendable source associated with these
> procedures under CPT code 79900 except in the case of remote
> after-loading high intensity brachytherapy procedures (CPT codes
> 77781-77784). In the four codes cited, the expendable source is
> included in the RVUs for the TC of the procedures.

# - Radiation Physics Services (CPT Codes 77300 - 77399)

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> A/B MACs (B) pay for the PC and TC of CPT codes 77300-77334 and 77399
> on the same basis as they pay for radiologic services generally. For
> professional component billings in all settings, A/B MACs (B) presume
> that the radiologist participated in the provision of the service,
> e.g., reviewed/validated the physicist's calculation. CPT codes 77336
> and 77370 are technical services only codes that are payable by A/B
> MACs (B) in settings in which only technical component is are payable.

# - Supervision and Interpretation (S&I) Codes and Interventional Radiology

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

# - Physician Presence

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Radiologic supervision and interpretation (S&I) codes are used to
> describe the personal supervision of the performance of the radiologic
> portion of a procedure by one or more physicians and the
> interpretation of the findings. In order to bill for the supervision
> aspect of the procedure, the physician must be present during its
> performance. This kind of personal supervision of the performance of
> the procedure is a service to an individual beneficiary and differs
> from the type of general supervision of the radiologic procedures
> performed in a hospital for which A/B MACs (A) pay the costs as
> physician services to the hospital. The interpretation of the
> procedure may be performed later by another physician. In situations
> in which a cardiologist, for example, bills for the supervision (the
> "S") of the S&I code, and a radiologist bills for the interpretation
> (the "I") of the code, both physicians should use a "-52" modifier
> indicating a reduced service, e.g., only one of supervision and/or
> interpretation. Payment for the fragmented S&I code is no more than if
> a single physician furnished both aspects of the procedure.

# - Multiple Procedure Reduction

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> A/B MACs (B) make no multiple procedure reductions in the S&I or
> primary non- radiologic codes in these types of procedures, or in any
> procedure codes for which the descriptor and RVUs reflect a multiple
> service reduction. For additional procedure codes
>
> that do not reflect such a reduction, A/B MACs (B) apply the multiple
> procedure reductions.

# - Services of Portable X-Ray Suppliers

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Services furnished by portable x-ray suppliers may have as many as
> four components. A/B MACs (B) must follow the following rules.

# - Professional Component

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Pay the PC of radiologic services furnished by portable x-ray
> suppliers on the same basis as other physician fee schedule services.

# - Technical Component

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Pay the TC of radiology services furnished by portable x-ray suppliers
> under the fee schedule on the same basis as TC services generally.

# - Transportation Component (HCPCS Codes R0070 - R0076)

## (Rev. 3387, Issued: 10-30-15, Effective: 01-01-16, Implementation: 01-01-16)

> This component represents the transportation of the equipment to the
> patient. Establish local RVUs for the transportation R codes based on
> Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) knowledge of the nature of
> the service furnished. The MACs shall allow only a single
> transportation payment for each trip the portable x-ray supplier makes
> to a particular location. When more than one patient is x-rayed at the
> same location, e.g., a nursing home, prorate the single fee schedule
> transportation payment among all patients (Medicare Parts A and B, and
> non-Medicare) receiving the portable x-ray services during that trip,
> regardless of their insurance status. For example, for portable x-ray
> services furnished at a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF), the
> transportation fee should be allocated among all patients receiving
> portable x-ray services at the same location in a single trip
> irrespective of whether the patient is in a Part A stay, a Part B
> patient, or not a Medicare beneficiary at all. If the patient is in a
> Part A SNF stay, the transportation and set up costs are subject to
> consolidated billing and not separately billable to Medicare Part B.
> For a privately insured patient, it would be the responsibility of
> that patient's insurer. For a Medicare Part B patient, payment would
> be made under Part B for the share of the transportation fee
> attributable to that patient.
>
> R0075 must be billed in conjunction with the radiology codes and only
> when the x-ray equipment used was actually transported to the location
> where the x-ray was taken.
>
> R0075 would not apply to the x-ray equipment stored in the location
> where the x-ray was done (e.g., a nursing home) for use as needed.
>
> Below are the definitions for each modifier that must be reported with
> R0075. Only one of these five modifiers shall be reported with R0075.
> **NOTE**: If only one patient is served, R0070 should be reported with
> no modifier since the descriptor for this code reflects only one
> patient seen.
>
> UN - Two patients served UP - Three patients served UQ - Four patients
> served UR - Five Patients served
>
> US - Six or more patients served
>
> Payment for the above modifiers must be consistent with the definition
> of the modifiers. Therefore, for R0075 reported with modifiers, -UN,
> -UP, -UQ, and --UR, the total payment for the service shall be divided
> by 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively. For modifier --US, the total payment
> for the service shall be divided by 6 regardless of the number of
> patients served. For example, if 8 patients were served, R0075 would
> be reported with modifier --US and the total payment for this service
> would be divided by 6.
>
> The units field for R0075 shall always be reported as "1" except in
> extremely unusual cases. The number in the units field should be
> completed in accordance with the provisions of 100-04, chapter 23,
> section 10.2 item 24 G which defines the units field as the number of
> times the patient has received the itemized service during the dates
> listed in the from/to field. The units field must never be used to
> report the number of patients served during a single trip.
> Specifically, the units field must reflect the number of services that
> the specific beneficiary received, not the number of services received
> by other beneficiaries.
>
> As a contractor priced service, MACs must initially determine a
> payment rate for portable x-ray transportation services that is
> associated with the cost of providing the service. In order to
> determine an appropriate cost, the MAC should, at a minimum, cost out
> the vehicle, vehicle modifications, gasoline and the staff time
> involved in only the transportation for a portable x-ray service. A
> review of the pricing of this service should be done every five years.
>
> Direct costs related to the vehicle carrying the x-ray machine are
> fully allocable to determining the payment rate. This includes the
> cost of the vehicle using a recognized depreciation method, the salary
> and fringe benefits associated with the staff who drive the vehicle,
> the communication equipment used between the vehicle and the home
> office, the salary and fringe benefits of the staff who determine the
> vehicles route (this could be proportional of office staff), repairs
> and maintenance of the vehicle(s), insurance for the vehicle(s),
> operating expenses for the vehicles and any other reasonable costs
> associated with this service as determined by the MAC. The MAC will
> have discretion for allocating indirect costs (those costs that cannot
> be directly attributed to portable x-ray transportation) between the
> transportation service and the technical component of the x- ray
> tests.
>
> Suppliers may send MACs unsolicited cost information. The MACs may use
> this cost data as a comparison to its contractor priced determination.
> The data supplied should reflect a year's worth (either calendar or
> corporate fiscal) of information. Each provider who submits such data
> is to be informed that the data is subject to verification and will be
> used to supplement other information that is used to determine
> Medicare's payment rate.
>
> The MACs are required to update the rate on an annual basis using
> independently determined measures of the cost of providing the
> service. A number of readily available measures (e.g., ambulance
> inflation factor, the Medicare economic index) that are used by the
> Medicare program to adjust payment rates for other types of services
> may be appropriate to use to update the rate for years that the MAC
> does not recalibrate the payment. Each MAC has the flexibility to
> identify the index it will use to update the rate. In addition, the
> MAC can consider locally identified factors that are measured
> independently of CMS as an adjunct to the annual adjustment.
>
> **NOTE:** No transportation charge is payable unless the portable
> x-ray equipment used was actually transported to the location where
> the x-ray was taken. For example, MACs do not allow a transportation
> charge when the x-ray equipment is stored in a nursing home for use as
> needed. However, a set-up payment (see §90.4, below) is payable in
> such situations. Further, for services furnished on or after January
> 1, 1997, MACs may not make separate payment under HCPCS code R0076 for
> the transportation of EKG equipment by portable x-ray suppliers or any
> other entity.

# - Interpretation of Diagnostic Tests

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

# - X-rays and EKGs Furnished to Emergency Room Patients

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> The professional component of a diagnostic procedure furnished to a
> beneficiary in a hospital includes an interpretation and written
> report for inclusion in the beneficiary's medical record maintained by
> the hospital. (See [42 CFR
> 415.120(a)](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/).)
>
> A/B MACs (B) generally distinguish between an "interpretation and
> report" of an x-ray or an EKG procedure and a "review" of the
> procedure. A professional component billing based on a review of the
> findings of these procedures, without a complete, written report
> similar to that which would be prepared by a specialist in the field,
> does not meet the conditions for separate payment of the service. This
> is because the review is already included in the emergency department
> evaluation and management (E/M) payment. For example, a notation in
> the medical records saying "fx-tibia" or EKG-normal would not suffice
> as a separately payable interpretation and report of the procedure and
> should be considered a review of the findings payable through the E/M
> code. An "interpretation and report" should address the findings,
> relevant clinical issues, and comparative data (when available).
>
> Generally, A/B MACs (B) must pay for only one interpretation of an EKG
> or x-ray procedure furnished to an emergency room patient. They pay
> for a second interpretation (which may be identified through the use
> of modifier "-77") only under unusual circumstances (for which
> documentation is provided) such as a questionable finding for which
> the physician performing the initial interpretation believes another
> physician's
>
> expertise is needed or a changed diagnosis resulting from a second
> interpretation of the results of the procedure.
>
> When A/B MACs (B) receive only one claim for an interpretation, they
> must presume that the one service billed was a service to the
> individual beneficiary rather than a quality control measure and pay
> the claim if it otherwise meets any applicable reasonable and
> necessary test.
>
> When A/B MACs (B) receive multiple claims for the same interpretation,
> they must generally pay for the first bill received. A/B MACs (B) must
> pay for the interpretation and report that directly contributed to the
> diagnosis and treatment of the individual patient. Consideration is
> not given to physician specialty as the primary factor in deciding
> which interpretation and report to pay regardless of when the service
> is performed. Consideration is not given to designation as the
> hospital's "official interpretation" as a factor in determining which
> claim to pay. A/B MACs (B) pay for the interpretation billed by the
> cardiologist or radiologist if the interpretation of the procedure is
> performed at the same time as the diagnosis and treatment of the
> beneficiary. (This interpretation may be an oral report to the
> treating physician that will be written at a later time.)
>
> If the first claim received is from a radiologist, A/B MACs (B)
> generally pay the claim because they would not know in advance that a
> second claim would be forthcoming.
>
> When A/B MACs (B) receive the claim from the emergency room (ER)
> physician and can identify that the two claims are for the same
> interpretation, they must determine whether the claim from the ER
> physician was the interpretation that contributed to the diagnosis and
> treatment of the patient and, if so, they pay that claim. In such
> cases, A/B MACs (B) must determine that the radiologist's claim was
> actually quality control and institute recovery action.
>
> The two parties should reach an accommodation about who should bill
> for these interpretations. The following examples apply to A/B MACs
> (B):

## EXAMPLE A:

> A physician sees a beneficiary in the ER on January 1 and orders a
> single view chest x- ray. The physician reviews the x-ray, treats, and
> discharges the beneficiary. An A/B MAC (B) receives a claim from a
> radiologist for CPT code 71010-26 indicating an interpretation with
> written report with a date of service of January 3. The A/B MAC (B)
> will pay the radiologist's claim as the first bill received. A/B MACs
> (B) do not have to develop the claim to determine whether the
> interpretation was a quality control service.

## EXAMPLE B:

> Same circumstances as Example A, except that the physician who sees
> the beneficiary in the ER also bills for CPT code 71010-26 with a date
> of service of January 1. The A/B MAC (B) will pay the first claim
> received. If the first claim is from the treating physician
>
> in the ER, and there is no indication the claim should not be paid,
> e.g., no reason to think that a complete, written interpretation has
> not been performed, payment of the claim is appropriate. The A/B MAC
> (B) will deny a claim subsequently received from a radiologist for the
> same interpretation as a quality control service to the hospital
> rather than a service to the individual beneficiary.

## EXAMPLE C:

> Same as Example B except that the claim from the radiologist uses
> modifier "-77" and indicates that, while the ER physician's finding
> that the patient did not have pneumonia was correct, there was also a
> suspicious area of the lung suggesting a tumor that required further
> testing. In such situations, the A/B MAC (B) pays for both claims
> under the fee schedule.

## EXAMPLE D:

> The A/B MAC (B) receives separate claims for CPT code 71010-26 from a
> radiologist and a physician who treated that patient in the ER, both
> with a date of service of January
>
> 1\. The first claim processed in the system is paid and the second
> claims will be identified and denied as a duplicate. If the denied
> "provider" is the radiologist and he raises an issue the A/B MAC (B)
> will develop the claim to determine whether the findings of the
> radiologist's interpretation were conveyed to the treating physician
> (orally or in writing) in time to contribute to the diagnosis and
> treatment of the patient. If the radiologist's interpretation was
> furnished in time to serve this purpose, that claim should be paid,
> and the claim from the other physician should be denied as not
> reasonable and necessary.

# - Special Billing Instructions for Claims Submitted to A/B MACs (A)

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Transmittal 368 (CR 1323 issued May 24-01) which revised the following
> SNF sections of the manual but not incorporated in the master manual.
>
> SNF-533.1, SNF-533.1.A, SNF-533.1.B, SNF-533.1.C, SNF-533.1.D,
> SNF-533.1.E
>
> For billing instructions, see chapter 25.

# - Aborted Procedure

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> When a procedure is not completed, the SNF should bill an unlisted
> code (e.g., CPT code ending in 99) and show the actual charges for the
> procedure. The A/B MAC (A) will request additional data from the SNF
> to determine applicable payment. Deductible and coinsurance apply
> based on fee schedule rules.

# - Combined Procedures (Radiology)

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> There are no separate codes covering certain combined procedures,
> e.g., a hand and forearm included in a single x-ray. The code with the
> higher fee schedule amount should be used.

# - Payment for Radiopharmaceuticals

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Radiopharmaceuticals are not subject to the fee schedule, but are paid
> based on reasonable cost when given in a SNF. SNFs report HCPCS codes
> 79900, A4641, A4642, A9500, A9503, and A9505, as appropriate, with
> revenue codes 0333, 034X, or 0636.
>
> **NOTE:** The correct code to report is A4641. It replaced HCPCS code
> 78990. HCPCS code 78990 should not be reported because this code is
> not valid for Medicare purposes.
>
> **EXCEPTION:** HCPCS codes 77781, 77782, 77783, and 77784 include
> payment for the radiopharmaceutical in the technical component. When
> these procedures are performed, SNFs do not report radiopharmaceutical
> codes 79900, A4641, A4642, A9500, A9503, and A9505. The A/B MAC (A)
> will reject codes 79900, A4641, A4642, A9500, A9503, and A9505 when
> they are billed for supplies used in conjunction with procedure codes
> 77781, 77782, 77783, and 77784.

# 120 - Radiology or Other Diagnostic Unlisted Service or Procedure Billing Instructions for A/B MAC (A) Claims

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Some radiology and other diagnostic services may not have a
> corresponding HCPCS code. This is because these are typically services
> that are rarely provided, unusual, or new. The provider should assign
> the appropriate "unlisted procedure" code to any such service. The
> following list contains the "unlisted procedure" codes along with the
> suggested revenue code for billing. These services are paid on a fee
> schedule if one exists or cost if a fee has not been established for
> SNFs. However, before billing any of these codes the provider needs to
> furnish a complete description of the radiology procedure to the A/B
> MAC (A) for review and analysis. The description should include a
> narrative definition of the procedure and a description of the nature,
> extent and need for the procedure and the time, effort, and equipment
> necessary. The A/B MAC (A) will determine if the provider has
> correctly identified the procedure as "unlisted." If the procedure is
> not identified correctly, the A/B MAC (A) will inform the provider of
> the
>
> correct HCPCS code to assign to the procedure. If there is no fee
> schedule amount established, these services are paid based on cost to
> SNFs.

> MSN: 16.10 and 36.1 (if ABN was issued) or 36.2 (if ABN was not
> issued)
>
> **NOTE:** A/B MACs (A) are not to include MSN 16.10.

# 140.4 -- Advance Beneficiary Notices (ABNs)

## (Rev. 1236, Issued: 05-11-07, Effective: 01-01-07, Implementation: 07-02-07)

> For the denial situations listed in Section 140.1, physicians,
> practitioners and hospitals are liable for payment unless they issue
> an appropriate ABN. Contractors will utilize the appropriate messages,
> see sections 140.2 and 140.3.

# 150 - Place of Service (POS) Instructions for the Professional Component (PC or Interpretation) and the Technical Component (TC) of Diagnostic Tests

## (Rev. 3315, Issued: 08-06-15, Effective: 01-01-16, Implementation: 01-04-16)

> Many of the diagnostic services, including radiology services,
> provided by physicians/practitioners contain both a technical
> component (TC) and a professional component (PC). Often, the PC and TC
> of diagnostic services are furnished in different settings. As a
> general policy, the POS code assigned by the physician/practitioner
> for the PC of a diagnostic service shall be the setting in which the
> beneficiary received the TC service.

## Interpretation Provided Telephonically by Wireless Remote

> Teleradiology services (radiology services that do not require a
> face-to-face encounter with the patient furnished through the use of a
> telecommunications system) are discussed in Pub. 100-02, Medicare
> Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 15, section 30. The interpretation of
> an x-ray, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram and tissue samples
> are listed as examples of these services.
>
> In cases where the face-to-face requirement is obviated such as those
> when a physician/practitioner provides the PC/interpretation of a
> diagnostic test, from a distant site, the POS code assigned by the
> physician /practitioner shall be the setting in which the beneficiary
> received the TC service. The POS code for a teleradiology
> interpretation is generally the place where the beneficiary received
> the TC, or face-to-face encounter. The POS code representing the
> setting where the beneficiary received the TC is entered in the ASC
> X12 837 professional claim format or in item 24B on the paper claim
> Form CMS
>
> 1500\. In cases where it is unclear which POS code applies, the
> Medicare contractor can provide guidance.
>
> For example: A beneficiary receives an MRI on an outpatient hospital
> campus near his/her home. The outpatient hospital submits a claim that
> would correspond to the TC portion of the MRI. The physician furnishes
> the PC portion of the beneficiary's MRI from his/her office location -
> POS code 22 (On Campus-Outpatient Hospital) shall be used on the
> physician's claim to indicate that the beneficiary received the
> face-to-face portion of the MRI, the TC, on the campus of an
> outpatient hospital.

## Interpretation Provided Outside of the United States

> Generally, Medicare will not pay for health care or supplies that are
> performed outside the United States (U.S.). The term "outside the
> U.S." means anywhere other than the 50 states of the U.S., the
> District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam,
> American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. See Pub. 100-02,
> chapter 16, section 60, for exceptions to the "outside the U.S."
> exclusions.

## Interpretation Provided Under Arrangement - To A Hospital

> **Separate TC and PC**
>
> If a diagnostic test which has a separate TC and PC is provided under
> arrangement to a hospital, the physician who reads the test can bill
> and be paid for the professional component. Both the technical and
> professional components of the test are also subject to the physician
> self-referral prohibition.
>
> The appropriate POS code for the interpretation (or PC) is the setting
> where the beneficiary received the TC service. If the interpretation
> is performed in the physician's office and the patient received the TC
> service in the provider-based outpatient hospital setting, the
> physician assigns POS code 22, for On Campus-Outpatient Hospital, or
> POS 19, for Off Campus-Outpatient Hospital, on the claim for the
> interpretation or PC.

## Global Service

> When a physician performs a diagnostic test under arrangement to a
> hospital and the test and the interpretation are not separately
> billable, the interpretation cannot be billed by the physician. In
> this scenario, the hospital is the only entity that can bill for the
> diagnostic test which encompasses the interpretation. There is no POS
> code for the interpretation since a physician claim is not generated.

## Global Billing

> Billing globally for services that are split into PC and TC components
> is only possible when the TC and the physician who provides the PC of
> the diagnostic service are furnished by the same physician or supplier
> entity and the PC and TC components are
>
> furnished within the same Medicare physician fee schedule payment
> locality. Merely applying the same POS code to the PC as that of the
> TC (as described in "A" above) does not permit global billing for any
> diagnostic procedure.

## Determination of Payment Locality

> Under the Medicare physician fee schedule (MPFS), payment amounts are
> based on the relative resources required to provide services and vary
> among payment localities as resource costs vary geographically as
> measured by the geographic practice cost indices (GPCIs). The payment
> locality is determined based on the location where a specific service
> code was furnished. For purposes of determining the appropriate
> payment locality, CMS requires that the address, including the ZIP
> code for each service code be included on the claim form in order to
> determine the appropriate payment locality. The location in which the
> service code was furnished is entered on the ASC X12 837 professional
> claim format or in Item 32 on the paper claim Form CMS 1500.
>
> Global Service Code
>
> If the global diagnostic service code is billed, the biller (either
> the entity that took the test, physician who interpreted the test, or
> separate billing agent) must report the address and ZIP code of where
> the test was furnished on the bill for the global diagnostic service
> code. In other words, when the global diagnostic service code is
> billed, for example, chest x-ray as described by HCPCS code 71010 (no
> modifier TC and no modifier -26), the locality is determined by the
> ZIP code applicable to the testing facility, i.e. where the TC of the
> chest x-ray was furnished. The testing facility (or its billing agent)
> enters the address and ZIP code of the setting/location where the test
> took place. This practice location is entered using the ASC X12 837
> professional claim format or in Item 32 on the paper claim Form CMS
> 1500. As explained in D above, in order to bill for a global
> diagnostic service code, the same physician or supplier entity must
> furnish both the TC and the PC of the diagnostic service and the TC
> and PC must be furnished within the same MPFS payment locality.
>
> Separate Billing of Professional Interpretation
>
> If the same physician or other supplier entity does not furnish both
> the TC and PC of the diagnostic service, or if the same physician or
> other supplier entity furnishes both the TC and PC but the
> professional interpretation was furnished in a different payment
> locality from where the TC was furnished, the professional
> interpretation of a diagnostic test must be separately billed with
> modifier -26 by the interpreting physician.
>
> When the physician's interpretation of a diagnostic test is billed
> separately from the technical component, as identified by modifier
> -26, the interpreting physician (or his or her billing agent) must
> report the address and ZIP code of the interpreting physician's
> location on the claim form. If the professional interpretation was
> furnished at an unusual and infrequent location for example, a hotel,
> the locality of the professional interpretation is determined based on
> the Medicare enrolled location where the interpreting physician
>
> most commonly practices. The address and ZIP code of this practice
> location is entered using the ASC X12 837 professional claim format or
> in Item 32 on the paper claim Form CMS 1500.
