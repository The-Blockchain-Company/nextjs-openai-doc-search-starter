## A1-1200, B1-4200

> The Secretary is authorized to make funds available for administrative
> costs related to the functions contractors perform as stipulated in
> the Agreement under the provisions of title XVIII of the Social
> Security Act. Funds available for this purpose are in the DHHS
> Appropriation Act. These funds are provided for a fiscal year (FY)
> beginning October 1. They are not available for obligation and
> expenditure until released by the Office of Management and Budget in
> an apportionment that is made on a quarterly basis to preclude an
> expenditure rate that exceeds the appropriation. Medicare
> administrative funds will be requested separately for program
> management (PM) and Medicare Integrity Program (MIP). Contractors
> shall report this on CMS\'s activity level budget and cost reporting
> system - Contractor Administrative-Budget and Financial Management
> System (CAFM II).
>
> The Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 USC 1341, provides that no government
> official or employee may authorize or create an obligation, or make or
> cause to make an expenditure in excess of an apportionment of
> appropriated funds. To enforce this prohibition, the Act requires
> administrative discipline of government officials and employees who
> inadvertently exceed their authority, and criminal penalties for those
> who do so knowingly and willfully.
>
> In order for the Secretary to ensure that adequate funds are available
> and trust funds are efficiently used for the administration of the
> Federal Health Insurance Program, the contractor shall submit an
> estimate of administrative costs that are anticipated for the ensuing
> FY. Predicate the annual budget on the budget and performance
> requirements (BPRs) issued by CMS and on its previous Medicare cost
> and productivity experience. It shall consider unusual or
> non-recurring type activities that could be part of the historical
> cost data.
>
> The Secretary will pay contractors for necessary and proper costs of
> administration as determined by the Principles of Reimbursement in
> Appendix B of the contract/agreement. The amount of the settlement is
> subject to audit. Thus, the inclusion of funds in an approved budget
> or in a subsequent cost statement does not constitute a final
> determination as to the allowability of such costs. However, it is
> intended that a mutual agreement on the estimate will facilitate
> fiscal planning by both the contractor and CMS, and provide a basis
> for common understanding for determining administrative costs.
>
> The Secretary may also enter into fixed price or other non-cost
> related agreements. The instructions that follow do not pertain to
> non-cost related agreements, unless specifically designated in the

## A1-1203, B1-4203

> Costs are allocated and reported separately by PM and MIP functions
> and activities. Contractors and CMS are not allowed to co-mingle the
> PM and MIP funding that is appropriated separately by Congress. PM
> provides funding for claims processing functions, and MIP provides
> funding for payment safeguard functions. A function is a unique
> operation that is separately identifiable, such as Claims Payment or
> Appeals. An activity is defined as a subcategory of a Medicare
> function. The activities available to a contractor may vary depending
> upon the functions performed by that contractor. A listing of

> The CAFM II requires contractors to identify and report costs on an
> activity level basis with detailed cost reporting and will sum these
> costs by function. The system will then generate a separate PM and/or
> MIP budget that the contractor will certify for accuracy of costs

# 80 - Completing the Administrative Budget and Cost Report Activity Form - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1211, B1-4211

A.  General

> The Administrative Budget and Cost Report (ABCR) is intended for
> multiple-use. It is used for the following specific annual, periodic,
> and monthly reports the contractor submits.

-   Budget Request (BR). See §230;

-   Supplemental Budget Request (SBR). See §240;

-   Interim Expenditure Report (IER). See Chapter 2, §60; and

-   Final Administrative Cost Proposal (FACP). See Chapter 2, §130.

> For all of these uses, funding and costs are reported separately by PM
> and MIP functions and activities. Funding and costs for PM and MIP
> must be kept separate and may not be co-mingled.
>
> The contractor shall transmit the ABCR form for all budget reports
> electronically using the CAFM II System. See §§270 and Chapter 2, §180
> for due dates.

B.  Identification of Costs

> The ABCR identifies activities within each Medicare function. For each
> activity, the following costs are separately identified: salaries and
> wages, fringe benefits, Electronic Data Processing (EDP) equipment,
> other direct costs, other costs, non-Coordination of Benefits (COB)
> credits, overhead, general & administrative (G&A), fee/profit, total
> cost, other adjustments, forward funding, and total adjusted cost.
> Each Activity Screen also identifies up to three discrete workloads
> and direct, indirect, subcontract, and overhead/G&A hours.
>
> The contractor shall separately identify costs in the BR, IER, and
> FACP pending a determination of allowability by CMS. It shall identify
> these costs in the remarks section.

> totaled \$77,000 and general and administrative (G&A) costs totaled
> \$26,000.
>
> Subcontract costs, other adjustments and forward funding are not

# - Provider Reimbursement Function (Summary Level Code 16000) - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1213.5

> See §340.3. The Provider Reimbursement function (intermediaries)
> includes costs and workload(s) for establishing and maintaining
> providers\' accounting systems, submitting cost reports for quality
> assurance and provider audits, maintaining records and files for
> hospital-based physicians, and performing hospital cost reporting
> activities.

# - Participating Physicians Function (Summary Code 15000)

### (Rev. 1, 08-30-02) B1-4213.5

> The participating physician function (carriers) includes the costs for
> the continuation of the annual participating enrollment, limiting
> charge monitoring activities and the dissemination of participation
> information.

# - Productivity Investments (PI) Function (Summary Level Code 17000)

### (Rev. 26, 12-08-03) A1-1213.6

> The contractor shall include the cost of activities related to the
> development and implementation of approved PIs and administrative
> enhancements as directed by CMS.

A.  Activity Codes for Pis

> Activity codes for PIs will be assigned to approved projects. A list
> of approved PIs will be available in CAFM II. The contractor shall use
> only approved PI codes. The miscellaneous PI activity code may be used
> only on the initial BR and the SBR for projects that have not been
> approved and do not have an assigned PI activity code. It shall not
> use the miscellaneous PI Activity Code on an IER or FACP.

1.  PIs include administrative enhancements and legislative mandates
    directed by CMS that are considered essential for maintenance of
    effective program operations. They do not necessarily generate
    program savings.

2.  PIs may include activities that affect more than one Medicare
    function and are administered as a PI.

3.  PIs also include systems conversions and transitions. See D below.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
B.  PI Funding

> The PI funding is generally for first year start up costs only.
> Funding for subsequent years is generally treated as an ongoing cost,
> not a PI, and should be included as an ongoing operational cost in the
> contractor\'s BR. If PI funding after the first year is requested, a
> schedule with funding for each FY should be included in the initial
> request for funding. If CMS determines that PI funding for subsequent
> FYs is authorized, the contractor should include the PI funding
> authorized in its BR every year it is authorized.

C.  PI Costs

> The contractor shall report incremental direct costs and incremental
> overhead and general and administrative costs. If some of the
> non-incremental direct costs are incurred due to reallocation of staff
> time, document it but do not request funding. Incremental direct costs
> and incremental overhead and general and administrative costs may
> include:

-   Incremental personal service costs of staff and management directly
    > involved in the project (including programmers).

-   Materials and supplies used for the project

-   Subcontract services, such as feasibility studies done under
    > contract.

-   EDP costs including data conversion, computer time and EDP support
    > services that are incurred only if the project is done. These
    > costs should be spread to the appropriate cost categories on the
    > Activity Form. See Section 90.9. Include special charges under a
    > facilities management contract for programming changes.
    > Depreciation on equipment purchased in conjunction with the
    > project should be shown in the EDP equipment cost category; and

-   Incremental overhead and general and administrative costs caused by
    > any increase:

    -   in the cost incurred for overhead or general and administrative
        > functions (described in 90.9.H and 90.9.I) as a result of the
        > PI project implementation , or

    -   in the Medicare allocation from the corporate overhead or
        > general and administrative pool due to an increase in the cost
        > allocation base

D.  System Conversions and Transitions

> The following costs are included in systems conversions and
> transitions and may also apply to other projects:

-   Project Management Costs - Costs of essential staff/management
    > project support;

-   Software Installation Costs - Costs for installing and testing the
    > software;

-   File Conversion Costs - Costs for converting to the new system
    > including the costs of mapping, software development and testing;

-   Interface Development and Implementation Costs - Costs to interface
    > with external programs e.g., for electronic data interchange,
    > check writing, 1099 preparation, other reports and forms;

-   Training Costs - Costs of staff training including train the
    > trainer, technical staff and user staff training costs; and

-   Other Costs - Costs of provider education, outreach, and post-
    > implementation problem resolution.

E.  Cost-Benefit Documentation for PI Projects

    1.  General

> Before funding will be approved for a project that is proposed by a
> contractor, it must be demonstrated to be cost-beneficial. A project
> will generally only be approved if the net present value (NPV) for the
> project is equal to or greater than zero. The present value of the
> savings is at least equal to the costs of implementation when both are
> discounted to the same start date. As a general rule, CMS will
> consider only projects having a positive NPV over 2 years. However,
> the contractor shall provide probable costs and savings taken over all
> years of the project.
>
> This documentation does not supplant the existing prior approval
> process or the threshold amounts specified in the Medicare
> contract/agreement for system enhancements and subcontracts.

2.  Applicability

> The contractor shall include cost-benefit documentation with all
> requests for PI funds. The amount of the documentation required
> depends on the estimated cost and complexity
>
> of the project. Administrative enhancements and systems transitions
> directed by CMS are not subject to this cost-benefit test unless
> specifically required by CMS.

3.  Documentation

> The contractor shall document cost-benefit analysis using NPV
> calculations of costs and savings discounted to the start date. A
> narrative explanation of cost-benefit analysis should identify the
> assumptions for the analysis such as the start date, discount rate,
> and costs and savings in each fiscal year. The contractor shall
> include the following items in documentation:

-   Estimated Cost - The contractor shall show cost items in categories
    > reported for activities. See §90.9 for cost categories. It shall
    > provide underlying cost details and the assumptions on which they
    > are based for each material cost item. It shall include personnel,
    > machine time, materials and outside services in the estimate of
    > costs. It shall also include EDP charges and overhead. For capital
    > expenditures in excess of \$500, it shall use standard procedures
    > for establishing the asset\'s useful life and for the depreciation
    > schedule. CMS pays expenses when incurred; the contractor shall
    > include the proper depreciation and return on investment for the
    > period before implementation in its analysis.

-   Administrative Cost Savings - The contractor shall outline any
    > savings in staff time, postage, and computer time. It shall
    > include only cost reductions, not cost avoidance. It shall reduce
    > these savings by increases in administrative costs attributable to
    > the project (e.g., temporary productivity losses due to learning
    > curve, \"downtime\" for problem resolution, and depreciation for
    > equipment purchased).

-   Benefit Savings - The contractor shall estimate the amount of
    > benefit savings, if any, which result from preventing or
    > recovering erroneous payments, based on policy in effect at the
    > time of the analysis.

-   Discount Rate - The contractor shall use the interest rate
    > applicable under the Prompt Payment Act to discount both the
    > savings and costs to the start date. The interest rate is
    > published in the \"Federal Register.\"

-   Start Date - This is the point in time where the project first
    > incurs costs and is the date in time used to determine the Net
    > Present Value of the project.

# - Completing the Special Projects Form - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## 1214.1, B1-4214.1

A.  General

> This schedule is used to identify special project activities. Special
> projects are defined as those activities which may be of critical
> importance from an operational standpoint but which are not materially
> significant from a financial standpoint viewed in the context of the
> contractor\'s contract/agreement and its requirements. Therefore,
> reduced budget and cost reporting is required. Special projects may
> relate to any underlying Medicare function and/or to a specific
> activity. Because of the non-material (financial) nature of the
> activity, the contractor shall charge only direct costs and
> specifically identifiable and incremental overhead/G&A costs to the
> activity.

B.  Uses

> The schedule will be used only if there are special project activities
> to report. It will generally not be used for the BR but may be used
> for any or all of the following: SBR, NOBA, IER, and FACP. It shall
> not be used for cost reporting purposes unless funds are provided in
> the NOBA.

C.  Explanation of Entries on Special Projects Schedule

# - Completing the Certification Form

#### *(Rev. 149; Issued: 03-27-0; Effective Date: Upon the start of the contractor's next* option year; Implementation Date: 04-27-09)

A.  General

> There are four sections that are utilized by the user to generate the
> PM certification. They are: Credit, Activity Summary by Function,
> Administrative Funds Drawn and Certification Screen. For MIP, there
> are three sections. They are: Activity Summary by Function,
> Administrative Funds Drawn and Certification Screen.
>
> For PM, the user will enter the COB credits. After the user has
> entered all COB credit information, the system will sum the data to a
> \"face sheet\" amount by Medicare function, for Total Cost and Total
> Adjusted Cost, including a separate line for COB credits. The
> contractor will attest to the accuracy of the data included in the
> report by completing a certification statement.

B.  Uses

> The form will be used for the BR, SBR, IER, and FACP.

C.  Completing the Certification Section

    1.  Credit Amount

> The contractor shall enter the separate cumulative amounts of cash
> received for Complementary Credit and Medicaid to equal total credits.
> The user must also enter the separate amounts of accrued credits in
> total. Accrued credits represent outstanding receivables (invoices
> that have been billed but payments have not been received as of report
> date). This section must be completed prior to generation of the
> Certification Section.
>
> The complementary credits shall be reported in the following manner:
>
> **Complementary Credit** -- Not applicable unless the Medicare
> contractor receives late payment for a transitioned COBA trading
> partner.
>
> **Medigap** -- the contractor shall report all complementary credits
> received from trading partners as a result of crossing over
> claim-based Medigap claims to trading partners. An agreement may be in
> place for transmission purposes.
>
> **COB Credits** -- the contractor shall report only the cash received
> from the COBC for claims crossed over in COBA production.
>
> **Accrued Credits** -- the contractor shall report all receivables due
> from trading partners that the contractor invoiced for themselves.
>
> **Accrued COB Credits** -- the contractor shall report all receivables
> due from the COBC for claims transmitted to the COBC for crossover in
> COBA production (adjusted by reimbursement, error reports, including
> accepted trading partner disputes that were returned to the
> contractors, and other adjustments reported on the contractor
> remittance advice).

2.  Activity Summary By Function Section

> This is a system-generated area. The system will sum the data to a
> total face sheet by Medicare function. No input is required by the
> user; however, the total must tie to subsidiary records.

3.  Administrative Funds Drawn Section

> This section is completed only for the IER. (See Chapter 2, section
> 60.6.)

4.  Certification Section

> The contractor shall enter name of Certifying Official and Title. An
> authorized official signs and dates the hard copy report and retains a
> copy in file.

5.  Remarks Section

> The contractor shall complete this section when appropriate.
>
> *Medicare Administrative Contractors and Durable Medical Equipment
> Medicare Administrative Contractors ONLY*
>
> *A. General*

> project officers. Cash received from the COBC shall be recorded in the
> Analysis Reporting and Tracking System (ARTs) monthly.*
>

# 240 - Additional Instructions Pertaining To Supplemental Budget Requests (SBRs) - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1256, B1-4256

A.  General

> These instructions pertain to SBRs filed after action is taken on the
> initial BR discussed in §230. An SBR is a contractor\'s request for
> additional funding after the FY has begun. The SBR is a request for
> additional funding for one or more activities. To the extent that the
> request, if approved, would result in a reclassification of the
> non-incremental costs and hours charged to other activities/functions,
> the contractor shall submit a schedule of non-incremental costs in
> accordance with §100.6C. It is not copied from either the NOBA or the
> BR. The contractor shall use the BPRs as a basis for providing its SBR
> justification. A SBR is generally filed after the contractor receives
> a NOBA for the full FY and it determines that there are insufficient
> funds to perform the statement of work outlined in the BPRs and the
> NOBA. A SBR may also be required if there is a special project for
> which it would like to request funding. Refer to §100.6 regarding PIs.
>
> An SBR may also be required in response to a CMS-generated request
> that a contractor perform a specific task. Such a CMS-generated
> request should be in writing and may include written procedures,
> manual issuances or any written request for work pertaining to special
> projects.
>
> A copy of the SBR, with rationale, must be sent to both the
> contractor\'s RO and CO at the time the SBR is transmitted via CAFM
> II. It shall send a copy to CO to the same address that it sends its
> BR. See §230.2 for address.

B.  Definitions

> The contractor shall base the SBR on the latest released NOBA or
> negotiated budget and any outstanding SBRs. An SBR is appropriate if
> there is a need for a change in total funding, a transfer of funds
> among functions, and/or a change in workload. The contractor shall
> select the correct activity code and enter incremental costs including
> hours and workload. It shall annotate in the Remarks section of the
> Activity Screen the NOBA number on which the current SBR is based.
>
> EXAMPLE: An SBR requesting additional claims funding of \$200,000,
> workload of 150,000 along with additional telephone inquiries funding
> of \$100,000 and workload of 25,000 would be transmitted as follows:

+-----------------------------------------+----------+-----------------+
| Activity Code 11001, (Bills/Claims      | > \      | > Workload      |
| Processing):                            | $200,000 | > 150,000       |
+=========================================+==========+=================+
| Activity Code 13001, (Telephone         | > \      | > Workload      |
| Inquiries):                             | $100,000 | > 25,000        |
+-----------------------------------------+----------+-----------------+

> Remarks: This SBR is based on NOBA #1.
>
> The contractor shall not include funding previously requested and
> denied unless it is specifically re-requesting funding for this item
> and has provided a revised budget justification to support the
> request.

C.  Shared Systems

> The CMS requires that each user group designate one of its members to
> submit SBRs for systems improvements on behalf of the group or, if the
> servicing subcontractor (the subcontractor performing the systems
> improvement work) is also a Medicare contractor, that the SBR be
> submitted by that Medicare contractor.
>
> If the servicing subcontractor is a commercial vendor, the SBR must be
> submitted by the designee on behalf of the group through the
> designee\'s parallel RO or the designated RO with a copy to CO. If the
> servicing subcontractor is another Medicare contractor, that
> contractor submits the SBR to its parallel RO or the designated RO
> with a copy to CO.
>
> In all cases, the SBR submitted is consolidated to include the request
> for the servicing subcontractor and any related funds requested by the
> other user group members.
>
> However, the consolidated SBR will clearly state the amount(s)
> requested on behalf of each user as well as the servicing
> subcontractor, any unique user expenses for each user pertaining to
> the shared system activity, and delineate projected savings for each
> user.
>
> All funding through the NOBA is to the designee or Medicare
> contractor. Cost reporting corresponds to the NOBA. User unique
> expenses such as training and/or related travel are
>
> funded directly to each user with costs reported accordingly. This
> applies even though the requested funds are included in the
> consolidated SBR.
>
> The designated contractor is responsible for amending its subcontract
> with the maintenance vendor, requesting prior approval if the project
> costs exceed its threshold in the prime contract and accounting for
> proper expenditure of the project funds.

D.  Minimum Documentation Requirements -- Justification

> A complete SBR must include transmission on CAFM II and submission of
> a written justification supporting the request. An appropriate
> official must submit the justification. The justification must provide
> sufficient detail for each cost category (see
> [[§90.9](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/106_financial/#s90.9)]{.underline}
> and below) and explicitly link the request to the BPRs and/or general
> instructions that require the work and cost.
>
> If the request equals or exceeds the smaller of \$100,000 or 5 percent
> of the total PM or MIP NOBA, whichever is applicable, the contractor
> shall define the major steps necessary to accomplish the proposed
> effort (at least 3 steps) and provide an operational and financial
> rationale which addresses each of the cost categories for each step.
> If the activity cannot be broken down into at least 3 steps, it shall
> explain why not.
>
> The operational rationale should explain the scope and types of
> efforts contemplated. The financial rationale should explain how the
> estimated funding needs were determined for each cost category through
> the identification of assumptions, supporting information and
> calculations used to arrive at the estimated amounts.

1.  Salaries/Wages and Fringe Benefits

> The contractor shall provide job classes, number of employees (actual
> or FTEs), rates, period of work, major deliverables and/or milestones
> with dates. It shall discuss any premium payments. (These two cost
> categories may be combined.)

2.  EDP Equipment

> The contractor shall discuss how the amount was determined or
> allocated and identify any extraordinary items required. If any
> equipment is to be leased or purchased, it shall provide details and,
> if appropriate, include a cost-benefit analysis.

3.  Subcontracts

> The contractor shall identify subcontractor, scope, major
> deliverables, period of work and rates.

4.  Other Direct Costs

> The contractor shall discuss how the amount was determined or
> allocated and any extraordinary items required. If any items are to be
> leased or purchased, it shall provide details and, if appropriate,
> include a cost-benefit analysis.

5.  Overhead/G&A

> The contractor shall discuss how the amount was determined or
> allocated and any extraordinary items required. (These two cost
> categories may be combined.)

6.  Hours

> The contractor shall identify and discuss both direct and subcontract
> hours.

7.  Workloads

> The contractor shall identify and discuss all significant workloads.

# - The Notice of Budget Approval (NOBA) - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1261, B1-4261

> A NOBA is issued by CMS to notify contractors of approved amounts for
> PM and MIP administrative expenses for the FY, including the amount of
> funds certified to be available. Contractors are not authorized to
> incur expenses in excess of the total certified amount for PM or MIP.
> PM and MIP funding must not be co-mingled and this limitation,
> therefore, applies to each separately. In addition, the contractor
> shall refer to the BPRs and/or the contract/agreement for the
> authority to shift funds among PM or MIP functions.
>
> The first NOBA issued for a FY is given a supplemental number of
> \"0\". Subsequent NOBAs are numbered sequentially. Where agreement on
> a budget cannot be reached, CMS issues a NOBA for less than the full
> FY year pending completion of negotiations. These NOBAs are annotated
> as a partial approval in the \"Remarks\" section and numbered as
> above. CMS may issue NOBAs for less than a full FY when necessary.
>
> All dollar amounts will be rounded to the nearest hundred, hours to
> the nearest hour, and bills payment workload to the nearest hundred.
> The end of FY NOBA is not rounded.
>
> There are separate summary screens and certifications for PM
> activities and MIP activities.
>
> The NOBA displays information by function and activity. See §100 for
> definitions of functions and activities. For each function and
> activity, hours, total cost, and workload will be displayed. The
> hours, total cost, and workload shown for a function is the sum of the
> data input for the activities for that function.

# - End of FY NOBA - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1261.1, B1-4261.1

> When claimed costs are less than the total approved for the FY, CMS
> issues a revised NOBA reducing the FY funding to the amount claimed on
> the FACP. This reduction keeps the amount of obligated funds to a
> minimum, thereby permitting maximum flexibility in the use of
> appropriated funds. If the contractor subsequently finds that not all
> costs have been claimed, it submits a revised FACP.

# 300 - Exhibit of Audit Selection Criteria Report - Intermediaries Only - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1270

> Reserved for Audit Selection Criteria Report

# - Completing the Audit Selection Criteria Report (ASCR) - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1271

A.  General Instructions

> Contractor shall use the report to show all the provider cost reports
> from high to low, by Medicare dollars at risk. The ASCR will be
> extracted from the System Tracking for Audit and Reimbursement (STAR)
> and submitted to the CMS BPO Bulletin Board 30 days after the end of
> the fiscal year, i.e., October 30.

B.  Specific Instructions

> The contractor shall complete the columns on the ASCR as follows:

-   Provider Number - It shall enter provider\'s number;

-   FYE - It shall enter provider\'s year end;

-   Provider Type - It shall enter appropriate STAR code and appropriate
    > audit selection criteria (ASC) code(s);

-   POA Code - Indicates the designated activity; (P) problem
    > resolution, (O) on-site review, or (A) audit. A blank indicates
    > desk reviewed only.

-   Medicare Dollars Claimed - It shall enter the Medicare dollars
    > claimed from the audited cost report. Use DRG column for DRG and
    > outlier benefit payments. It shall use pass-through column for PPS
    > pass-through costs, and Cost-Based column for all other provider
    > costs claimed;

-   Utilization - It shall enter days or visits, as appropriate, for the
    > total patient population and for the Medicare population. It shall
    > indicate the percent of Medicare utilization;

-   Notice of Amount of Program Reimbursement (NPR) Date - It shall
    > enter date of NPR; and

-   Cost Savings/Dissavings - It shall enter the dollar amount of
    > adjustments to payment as a result of the NPR.

# - Audit Selection Priorities - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1271.1

A.  General

> The contractor shall use the ASCR to decide which providers to audit.
> This determines the audit matrix within the BPRs. It shall base audit
> decisions upon the results (problems discovered) of its uniform desk
> review, professional surveys of filed cost reports, and prior
> audit/review findings.

B.  Audit Group

> The audit group provides for planning audits/initiatives that must be
> performed either because a special circumstance requires immediate
> audit attention, e.g., termination, merger, fraud or abuse, new
> providers, or because of special CMS instructions. The audit group is
> defined yearly in the CMS Budget Performance Requirements (BPR
> guidelines).
>
> Generally, existence of a special circumstance dictates that an audit
> is necessary. However, the contractor shall use discretion in this
> area, especially where there is a short period cost report from a new
> provider, a relatively small amount of Medicare payment, low Medicare
> utilization, or involvement of OIG or GAO, prohibiting an audit.

# - Level of Audit Effort - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1271.2

> Instructions require that the level of audit effort be determined by
> the results of the desk review or professional survey process, taking
> into account the priority, audit cost-to-audit savings ratio, and the
> level of budget resources available. In most situations, audits are
> limited. However, compliance with the Government Auditing Standards
> must be considered in all provider audits.

# 350 - Instructions for Using the System for Tracking Audit and Reimbursement (STAR)

### (Rev. 128; Issued: 07-13-07; Effective: 10-01-06; Implementation: 08-13-07)

A.  General

> The STAR is an automated system developed for the purpose of tracking
> the Medicare cost reporting process. STAR captures historical and
> current Medicare provider information for each cost report. The STAR
> User\'s Manual serves as the contractor\'s instructions for
> implementing the program functions within the STAR system.
>
> The CMS created the STAR Alert newsletter to clarify instructions in
> the STAR User\'s Manual and the intermediary manual pertaining to
> output reports created by STAR. The STAR Alert is issued several times
> a year and addresses concerns about various audit issues that may
> arise during the fiscal year (FY).

B.  STAR Time System **(Not required by the MACs)**

    -   All FIs must use the Time System;

    -   The FI enters time spent by employees on a particular

# 450 - Coordination of Medicare and Complementary Insurance Programs

### (Rev. 135; Issued: 01-25-08; Effective: 10-01-07; Implementation: 02-01-08)

> The release of title XVIII claims information for complementary health
> insurance purposes is permitted (under specified conditions) by
> Regulation No. 1 (Disclosure of Official Records and Information).
> This section establishes financial policies concerning identification
> of costs related to the release of this information by the contractor.
>
> Under the national Coordination of Benefits Agreement (COBA) crossover
> process, a COBA trading partner must pay the required charges for the
> release of Medicare claims information. The Medicare program absorbs
> charges for supplying duplicate Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) or
> billing forms to beneficiaries, their authorized representatives, and
> to SSOs. (See Medicare Bill Processing, Chapter 21, Medicare Summary
> Notice).
>
> On behalf of CMS, the Coordination of Benefits Contractor now signs
> national crossover agreements, known as COBAs, and also invoices,
> collects, and reconciles fees arising from the claims that it crosses
> over to trading partners. The COBC is also tasked with distributing
> collected crossover fees to those Medicare contractors whose claims
> were successfully transmitted and accepted by the COBA trading
> partner.
>
> Effective with October 1, 2007, the COBC assumes responsibility for
> the Medigap claim- based crossover process. At that time, it also
> assumes the foregoing responsibilities associated with invoicing the
> affected Medigap insurers, collecting the crossover fees from these
> entities, and distributing these fees to the affected Medicare
> contractors.
>
> All Part B contractors, including Medicare Administrative Contractors
> (MACs), and Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative
> Contractors (DMACs) shall invoice for the last claims files that they
> transmit to their associated Medigap insurers. In addition, these
> affected contractors shall pursue unpaid balances with the Medigap
> insurers following the conclusion of the Medigap claim-based crossover
> transition, which included clearing all residual Medigap claim-based
> crossover claims from their payment floors no later than October 31,
> 2007.
>
> [COBA Financial Management Processes]{.underline}
>
> Contractors were instructed through Transmittal 130 (Change Request
> \[CR\] 3614), dated December 17, 2004, to populate the 837 flat file
> with a 21-digit unique identifier in the Beginning of Hierarchical
> Transaction (BHT03) segment. Transmittal 586 (CR 3906), dated June 17,
> 2005, will add an additional digit to that BHT03 segment identifying
> the file as Test (T) or Production (P). Contractors shall report only
> these "production" claims sent to the COBC to their financial staff
> along with the unique value populated in the BHT03 segment, to
> facilitate reconciliation of reimbursements due to the contractor and
> related workload reporting. System reports shall include, at a
> minimum, formatted data similar to those developed for the receipt of
> the COBC Detailed Error Report, created in Transmittal 474 (CR 3709),
> dated February 11, 2005. It is possible for a claim to be crossed over
> to more than one trading partner. System reports shall reflect those
> situations when more than one Coordination of Benefits Agreement
> Identification Number (COBA ID) is included in a Common Working File
> (CWF) response trailer (29).
>
> Contractors shall decrease the number of claims from the reported
> amount on a particular BHT03 segment (when the last digit of the
> segment is a "P") to their financial staff based on the receipt of a
> COBC Detailed Error Report. Contractor financial staff shall not
>
> expect reimbursement for any claims that appear on the error report
> and shall adjust financial records (accrued credits) accordingly. If a
> trading partner receives a paper claim from a provider before it
> processes the electronic claim from the COBC, the trading partner will
> still have payment responsibility for the claim crossed over by the
> COBC. Therefore, the contractor financial staff shall expect payment
> for such claims. For COBA IDs that fall in the range for Medicaid
> claims (70000-77999), contractors shall not expect payment on these
> claims, and shall subtract that number of claims from the amount
> reported to their contractor financial staff for a particular BHT03
> segment that contains a "P". There are certain situations in which
> contractors will not be reimbursed for production claims that did
> cross over and did not appear on a COBC Detailed Error Report. These
> non-error report adjustments include (1) claims that may be crossed by
> both the contractor and the COBC within the first thirty (30) days of
> production; (2) write-offs that are approved by CMS; (3) claims that
> can't be read by the trading partner and, therefore, cannot be
> disputed at the Internal Control Number (ICN) level; and (4) other as

> transmitting the Medicare billing information to Medicaid. (See The
> Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 22, Medicare Summary

> used in the format given by Medicare:

-   A copy of the billing/claims form;

-   A copy of the Medicare Summary Notice;

-   A copy of the billing form and any attachments thereto; or

-   Electronic transfer containing the information described in Medicare
    > Claims Processing Manual, chapter 28.

> Where the State has the systems capacity to process data generated in

## A1-1602.3, B1-4602.3

> Where a State agency selects a Medicare contractor as its agent and a
> claims process separate from the Medicare claims process is developed,
> the cost of all functions performed in this separate process are a
> direct charge to the State agency. Arrangements for billing State
> agencies for the cost of this claims process are the contractor\'s

> the separate claims process, the provisions of §460.1 apply.
>
> It is possible that some operations for the separate title XVIII and

> cost centers exist, it is the contractor\'s responsibility to identify
> the effort expended for each program
>
> and charge costs from these costs centers to the appropriate program.
> The cost includes both direct and indirect costs.

# - Integrated Claims Processing Systems - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1602.4, B1-4602.4

> Where a State agency selects a Medicare contractor as its fiscal agent
> and the contractor has an integrated claims processing system,
> Medicare pays the full cost of operations which are required for
> processing title XVIII claims even though the operations benefit both
> the title XVIII and State medical assistance programs. Integrated
> operations generally include receiving, screening, determination of
> amount of payment, and portions of the keypunching and data processing
> functions. The contractor shall analyze integrated operations
> carefully in order to identify any functions that are not required
> under title XVIII but have been superimposed on the normal title XVIII
> claims process. For example, special coding required by the State
> agency, additional key punching and data processing necessary as a
> result of this coding, preparation of a separate check, and other
> similar activities are extra, identifiable functions not required in
> the title XVIII claims process and are not reimbursable by Medicare.
> State agencies are responsible for administrative costs of all extra,
> identifiable functions that the contractor performs while processing
> combined claims.
>
> The contractor shall furnish a letter of intent to the State agency.
> It shall clearly indicate any extra, identifiable functions that are
> part of integrated operations and are performed for medical assistance
> program purposes. It shall indicate any operations separate and apart
> from the integrated claims process that are performed solely for the
> State agency. The contractor and the State agency are responsible for
> establishing the terms of the agreement and the method of
> reimbursement. When negotiations have been completed, the contractor
> shall forward two copies to the servicing RO.

# - Other Services - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1602.5, B1-4602.5

> Where the contractor performs any other services for State agencies,
> which are not related to the title XVIII claims process, the cost of
> such services cannot be charged to title XVIII. The contractor shall
> identify these services and charge directly for them where possible.
> It shall charge the full cost, rather than add-on cost, to the State

# - Release of Physician Profile Information to Title XIX Agencies and to TRICARE Fiscal Intermediaries - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## B1-4603.1

> Medicare carriers are authorized to release physician charge
> information to State agencies that need this data to make medical
> assistance payments under title XIX, and to TRICARE fiscal
> intermediaries for use in administering the Civilian Health and
> Medical Program of the Uniformed Services. (See The Medicare General
> Information, Eligibility and Entitlement Manual, Chapter 6, for
> disclosure requirements.)
>
> The State agency and/or TRICARE fiscal intermediary should reach an
> agreement with the Medicare carrier on the cost involved prior to
> furnishing the data. Extra and identifiable costs associated with the
> retrieval and transfer of information include such things as
> programming, assembling the data, handling, correspondence, files
> search and copying. These costs will be charged to the State agency
> and to TRICARE. (In the Final Administrative Cost Proposal, notation
> should be made if information was furnished to title XIX agencies or
> the TRICARE fiscal intermediaries and the cost of retrieving and
> furnishing the information should be shown.)
>
> A carrier may have an integrated claims process; that is, it may
> process title XVIII and title XIX claims concurrently and mutual
> benefit may be derived from various operations in the claims process.
> In such cases, cost allocation is required in accordance with §470.2.
>
> In any case in which determination of the actual cost of disclosing
> information would interfere with efficient administration, such cost
> may be fixed at an amount estimated not to exceed actual cost. The

# - Principles for Sharing Costs of Physician Profiles When Used for Medicare and the Carriers\' Regular Business - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## B1-4603.2

> Criteria for the determination of reasonable charges for the Part B
> program required carriers to secure and maintain data. These criteria
> also emphasize that data supporting the customary charge of the
> physician are to be obtained from all sources available to the carrier
> so that the customary charge will reflect the charge made generally to
> the physician\'s patients for a particular service.
>
> Where several programs or lines of business derive mutual benefits
> from the use of physician profile data, the following principle should
> be observed to assure equitable distribution of costs:
>
> Where physician profiles established on data derived in whole or in
> part from the Medicare program are used by a carrier in any other
> program or business, cost sharing is required. The cost chargeable to
> the Medicare program will be determined by the volume of Medicare
> claims processed to the total claims processed for all lines of
> business using the physician profile data.
>
> The Secretary and the Secretary\'s delegated subordinates have a
> contractual right to information necessary to insure program
> continuity and to insure maximum efficiency and effectiveness. If a
> change of carriers in an area were to occur, it might be necessary to
> transfer to the succeeding carrier appropriate data to assure that no
> disruption of reasonable charge determinations would result. Such data

# - Establishing a Common Provider Audit Program. - (Rev. 1, 08-30- 02)

## A1-1603

> The following material (sections 490 through 500) applies to providers
> on prospective payment or cost reimbursement.
>
> Title XVIII of the Social Security Act requires that participating
> health care institutions (providers) be reimbursed on a reasonable
> cost basis and to achieve this a comprehensive provider audit program
> has been established. Some grant-in-aid programs, namely title V (the
> maternal child health services and crippled children\'s programs) and
> title XIX (Medicaid), also require that hospitals and possibly some
> other providers be reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis. Other third
> party payers may also have the same requirement. The common provider
> audit program is established to reduce the cost of provider auditing
> to participating third party payers and avoid duplicate auditing
> effort. The purpose then is to have one audit of a participating
> provider, which will serve the needs of all participating programs
> reimbursing the provider for services rendered.

# - Policies for Implementation of a Common Provider Audit Program for Titles V, XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1603.1

> Agreement has been reached between the Health Services and Mental
> Health Administration, PHS (title V), the Medical Services
> Administration, SRS (title XIX), and the Centers for Medicare &
> Medicaid Services, on basic policy governing the common audit program.
> This common audit policy has four basic elements: (a) cost sharing,
> (b) desk review, (c) field audit, and (d) final settlement.

# - Cost Sharing - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1603.2

> The costs incurred in auditing providers performing services for more
> than one of the above programs are to be shared on the basis of the
> amount of reimbursement (benefits paid) to individual providers by the
> respective programs.
>
> Any proposed modification to this method of sharing costs of audit
> will be evaluated on the basis of its merits. Alternative methods
> proposed should adhere to the basic principle that audit dollars are
> expended to protect the integrity of benefits paid.
>
> Costs to be shared include all costs incurred from the point of
> securing the cost report from the provider through the publishing and
> distribution of the audit findings (or cost settlement data where no
> audit is performed). If final settlement is included in the common
> audit program, these costs should also be shared.
>
> There have been some questions concerning the definition of
> reimbursement (benefits paid). Reimbursement by the program means the
> dollar amounts of payments made from program funds at final settlement
> and should include payments to providers for inpatient and outpatient
> services and, if applicable, combined physician billing.

# - Desk Review - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1603.3

> The desk review capability of the intermediary will be used for the
> principal, intensive review of the cost reports submitted by the
> providers. The purpose of the review will be to determine (l)
> acceptability of the cost report, (2) need for a field audit, and (3)
> if an audit is to be performed, the depth of the audit.

# - Field Audit - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1603.4

> The participants shall evaluate the existing field audit capability of
> intermediary in-house staff, State audit staff, or a subcontracted
> audit firm, in regard to their past experience with the audit
> capabilities to be used. Every effort should be made to utilize
> qualified field audit capability available from the State agencies.
> CMS expects intermediaries to avoid the more costly audit firm
> subcontracts wherever possible.

# - Final Settlement - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1603.5

> All participants in the common audit program are to receive copies of
> the audit findings or cost settlement data where no audit is
> performed. The audit workpapers are also to be available if needed to
> proceed with settlement. The final settlement may or may not be
> undertaken jointly as agreed upon by the parties. Where independent
> settlements are to be made, there should be coordination among the
> participants to review the findings, insure consistent treatment, and
> discuss the effects of proposed settlements on each program.

# - Implementing a Common Audit Program - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1603.6

> The CMS has contracted with intermediaries to perform certain
> functions required under title XVIII. The title V and XIX programs,
> which use State funds in conjunction with Federal funds, are
> administered by the States; therefore, an agreement should be executed
> between the intermediaries and the State agencies or their fiscal
> agents, whoever has the responsibility for auditing providers under
> titles V and XIX, to delineate the procedures to be followed, costs to
> be shared, method of payment for services, coordination necessary, and
> such other items as may be necessary for a complete understanding of
> what is expected of each party.
>
> A model agreement (Exhibit l) is furnished as a guide in the
> preparation of the agreement.
>
> Where the intermediary is also the fiscal agent for the State and
> responsible for the audit of providers under title V and/or title XIX,
> a common audit agreement is still necessary and should be submitted to
> CMS for review before being effectuated.
>
> In all cases, two copies of the executed agreement should be forwarded
> to the CMS regional office. The regional office will forward one of
> the copies to the Division of Contractor Operations so the common
> audit program can be monitored on a nationwide basis to assure
> consistent application of policy.

# - Contacting State Agencies or Their Fiscal Agents - (Rev. 1, 08- 30-02)

## A1-1603.7

> In those instances where the intermediary is also the State\'s fiscal
> agent and responsible for audit of the providers, there should be no
> difficulty working out an agreement which would be acceptable to the
> State and CMS. Where the intermediary has established contacts with
> the State agencies responsible for grants-in-aid programs, the
> feasibility for a common audit program should be explored with them.
> If the intermediary has not established contact with the State
> agencies, they should request assistance from their CMS regional
> office of their progress toward the establishment of a common audit
> program. Multi-State intermediaries should contact the appropriate
> fiscal specialist in the CMS central office for assistance and
> reporting progress.

# - Points to Remember in Discussions with Other Parties - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1603.8

> Initially, we anticipate that State agencies will not be familiar with
> our comprehensive desk review procedures and suggest that the
> intermediary arrange to meet with the State agency to explain the
> title XVIII procedures. The intermediary should ask the Health
> Insurance Regional Office to coordinate such a meeting with the titles
> V and XIX Regional Offices.
>
> In those instances where the intermediary is also the State\'s fiscal
> agent for one of the titles other than title XVIII and also has the
> responsibility for auditing, there will be no coordination problem.
> However, where the State agency does its own auditing or uses a
> different fiscal agent, the State agency may decide to permit the
> intermediary to use the title XVIII guides or they may wish, at least
> initially, to designate someone to review the desk review
> determinations with the intermediary. In any event, the intermediary
> should cooperate and attempt to resolve any conflict as to either the
> necessity or scope of audit through explanation of the determination
> made. Note that any audit felt necessary should benefit all titles in
> proportion to their share of the costs.
>
> The agreement with the State agencies should specify that either party
> may request a special audit of a provider or an abnormal exploration
> of a particular cost in a routine audit, so long as the requesting
> party assumes responsibility for the additional cost.

# - Coordination of Final Settlement Data Without A Common Audit Program - (Rev. 1, 08-30-02)

## A1-1604

> There may be instances where a State agency or their fiscal agents may
> not find it feasible to participate in a common audit program, yet

>
> It is recognized that the title XVIII final settlement data (whether

1.  Release of final settlement data based on comprehensive desk review
    > only - The cost of acquiring and developing the information is to
    > be shared on the basis of reimbursement to the individual provider
    > by the respective programs. Our review and appraisal reveals that
    > in the comprehensive desk review process little effort is expended
    > in verifying strictly title XVIII information and that most of the
    > effort would benefit all programs equally.

2.  Release of final settlement data based on audited cost information -
    > The cost of field audit only is to be shared on the basis of
    > reimbursement to the individual provider by the respective
    > programs. The desk review data will be included without charge.
