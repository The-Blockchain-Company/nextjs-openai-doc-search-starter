**10 - Overpayments Determined by the FI or Carrier**

**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

Overpayments are Medicare payments a provider or beneficiary has
received in excess of amounts due and payable under the statute and
regulations. Once a determination of an overpayment has been made, the
amount is a debt owed by the debtor to the United States Government.

Under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, each agency
of the Federal Government (pursuant to regulations jointly promulgated
by the Attorney General and the Comptroller General of the U.S.) must
attempt collection of claims of the Federal Government for money arising
out of the activities of the agency. The FI or carrier will not be
liable for overpayments it makes to debtors in the absence of fraud or
gross negligence on its part, however once an intermediary or carrier
determines an overpayment has been made it must attempt recovery of
overpayments in accordance with CMS regulations.

The Federal Claims Collection Act requires timely and aggressive efforts
to recover overpayments, including efforts to locate the debtor where
necessary, demands for repayment, and establishment of repayment
schedules, suspension of interim payments by intermediaries to
institutional providers, and recoupment or setoff, where appropriate.

In addition, The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 requires
Federal agencies to refer eligible delinquent debt to a Treasury
designated Debt Collection Center (DCC) for cross servicing and offset.

CMS is mandated to refer all eligible debt over 180 days delinquent for
cross servicing and offset.

This chapter deals with two general types of overpayments.

Aggregate overpayments involve a group or all of a Part A provider's
claims, e.g., overpayments discovered at cost-report settlement time or
change of FI, overpayments resulting from a pattern of improper
application of Medicare coverage provisions, overpayments resulting from
a periodic interim payment adjustment, situations involving provider
failure to file a cost report, or occasions of fraud or program abuse.
Aggregate overpayments are described in §10.1, §20 and §30 of this
chapter and Chapter 4, Debt Collection.

Individual overpayments refer to incorrect claims payment for services
under Part A or Part B. Individual overpayments are described in §10.2,
§80ff and Chapter 4, Debt Collection. Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP)
instructions can be found in the Medicare Secondary Payer Manual, CMS
Publication 100-5.

**10.1 - Aggregate Overpayments**

**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

**A. Stitutional Providers Serviced By Fis**

Aggregate overpayments to providers (overpayments arising in other than
individual cases) may occur by:

> •A pattern of furnishing and billing for excessive or noncovered
> services (see Program Integrity Manual);\
> ~~•~~Inclusion of non-allowable or excessive costs in the provider\'s
> cost report;
>
> •Excessive interim payments made to the provider;\
> •Failure to repay accelerated payments;\
> •Failure to file cost reports (Chapter 3, [§30]{.underline});or\
> •Determination of amounts due upon filing the cost report, during desk
> review, final settlement and reopening of the cost report.

**10.2 - Individual Overpayments**

**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

An individual overpayment is an incorrect payment for provider or
physician services made under title XVIII.

Examples of individual overpayment cases are:

•Payment for provider, supplier or physician services after benefits
have been exhausted, or where the individual was not entitled to
benefits.

> •Incorrect application of the deductible or coinsurance.

•Payment for noncovered items and services, including medically
unnecessary services or custodial care furnished an individual.

> •Payment based on a charge that exceeds the reasonable charge.
>
> •Duplicate processing of charges/claims.

•Payment to a physician on a non-assigned claim or to a beneficiary on
an assigned claim. (Payment made to wrong payee.)

> •Primary payment for items or services for which another entity is the
> primary payer
>
> •Payment for items or services rendered during a period of
> non-entitlement.

**20 - Recovery of Cost Report Overpayments- Cost Report Filed (Rev. 29,
01-02-04)**

Providers of services under Part A of the Medicare program are normally
required to submit a cost report. A cost report must be submitted for
each cost reporting year or upon termination of the Medicare agreement.

**20.1 - Part A Provider is Participating in Medicare and Medicaid (Rev.
29, 01-02-04)**

When the provider files a cost report indicating an overpayment, a final
determination is deemed to have occurred if the cost report is not
accompanied by payment in full. Where the provider does not remit the
overpayment in full, the FI sends the first demand letter notifying the
provider that it will reduce or suspend interim payments in 15 days if
the provider does not make repayment arrangements.

If an overpayment is determined as a result of a tentative settlement,
final settlement, interim rate adjustment, or reopening the FI sends the
first demand letter within 7 calendar days. (See Chapter 4, §20)

When the Notice of Program Reimbursement (NPR), which is sent at the
conclusion of an audit, results in an overpayment a first demand letter
must also be sent. The NPR and the first demand letter may be sent
simultaneously, the first demand letter may be sent as a separate
document or the first demand letter

may be incorporated into the NPR. If the issuance of the NPR changes the
facts as stated in prior demand letters, the FI shall include in the NPR
an explanation of the revised overpayment amount.

See Chapter 4, §40 to determine if the overpayment requires a withhold
of payments.

If the provider does not respond within 30 days after the date of the
first demand letter, the FI sends a second demand letter notifying the
provider of the FI's intent to recoup the overpayment from interim
payments. (If the current percentage of withhold is less than 100%, the
demand letter shall state that interim payments will be withhold at 100%
in 30 days if repayment arrangements are not made.) If appropriate, the
FI shall advise the provider that action to withhold its Federal share
of Medicaid payments has been requested. The FI shall attempt to make
personal (or telephone contact) with the provider, 15 days after sending
the second demand letter to encourage either a lump-sum refund or a
request for an extended repayment plan. It shall document each contact.
(See Chapter 4, §10-20)

If there is no response or if the overpayment is still outstanding 30
days after the date of the second demand letter the FI shall send a
third demand letter. If eligible, the third demand letter shall include
notification of the intent to refer the entire debt to the Department of
Treasury for additional collection action. (See Chapter 4, §20)

**20.2 - Provider is No Longer Participating in Medicare and Not
Participating in Medicaid**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

If the FI becomes aware that there is an imminent likelihood that a
provider will be terminating from the Medicare program it shall contact
the RO with regard to future collection efforts.

If the FI discovers an overpayment upon the filing of a cost report, or
on determination of program reimbursement, with respect to a provider no
longer participating in Medicare, it shall immediately contact the
terminated provider to obtain a refund in a lump-sum, if it has not been
made.

The first demand letter shall be sent and all subsequent collection
activities performed as specified in §20.1 and Chapter 4, §10-20.

If the terminated provider has sold the entity to a participating
provider refer to Chapter 3, §130 for change of ownership instructions.

**20.3 - Provider is No Longer Participating in Medicare But Is
Participating in Medicaid**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

If the FI discovers an overpayment upon the filing of a cost report, or
on determination of the amount of program reimbursement for a former
Medicare provider that is still participating in Medicaid, it shall
immediately contact the provider to obtain a refund in a lump sum, if it
has not been made.

The first demand letter shall be sent and all subsequent collection
activities performed as specified in §20.1 and Chapter 4, §10-20.

The first demand letter must provide notice (See Chapter 4, §10-20 and
§60) that action to withhold its Federal share of Medicaid payments will
be requested if repayment arrangements are not made within 15 days of
the date of this notice. The second demand letter must provide notice
that action to withhold its Federal share of Medicaid payments has been
requested and will be initiated if repayment\
arrangements are not made. The FI shall send the third demand letter 30
days following the second where the provider has not responded, even
though procedures for withholding the Federal share of payments in title
XIX have been initiated, so that if recoupment efforts and withholding
of Medicaid funds are not effective, the case will be ready for referral
to the Department of Treasury.

If the terminated provider has sold the entity to a participating
provider refer to Chapter 3, §130 for change of ownership instructions.

**30 - Recovery of Cost Report Overpayments - Overdue Cost Report (Rev.
29, 01-02-04)**

When a provider fails to submit a cost report by the due date the FI
shall take recovery action to notify the provider that submission of the
cost report is required and that additional collection action will
continue until an acceptable cost report is submitted.

**30.1 - Provider is Participating in Medicare and Medicaid (Rev. 29,
01-02-04)**

**A. General**

For a participating provider, the cost report required for each cost
report period is due on or before the last day of the fifth month
following the end of that particular cost report period. For cost
reports ending on a day other than the last day of the month, cost
reports are due 150 days after the last day of the cost reporting
period.

If no cost report has been received by the seventh day after the due
date (including extensions), the FI must send the first demand letter in
Chapter 4, §20. (The seven-day timeframe allows for processing and mail
time.) In addition the FI must initiate 100% suspension of all Medicare
payments on day seven if the cost report has not been received, an
extension request has not been received and approved or a reduction in
the rate of suspension has not been approved. (See Chapter, )

If the provider does not respond within 30 days of the first demand
letter, the FI shall send the second demand letter. (See Chapter 4, §20)

**The FI shall make a personal (or telephone) contact with the provider
15 days after mailing the second demand letter. It shall determine any
problems the provider might be having in preparing the cost report, and
if, and when, the provider expects to complete and submit it. It shall
document the provider\'s response.**

If the provider does not respond within 30 days of the second demand
letter, the FI shall send the third demand letter. (See Chapter 4, §20)

**30.2.-.Provider is No Longer Participating in Medicare and Not
Participating in Medicaid**

**30.3 - Provider is No Longer Participating in Medicare But is
Participating in Medicaid: One or More Cost Reports Not Filed**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

**Where a provider\'s agreement under title XVIII has terminated and one
or more cost reports have not been submitted the FI shall send the first
demand letter. Requirements for this letter are in Chapter 4, §20. Since
this situation involves not only a terminated provider but a provider
that has failed to meet the basic obligation (submission of a cost
report) for the period when it did participate, the first demand letter
provides notice that initiation of the procedure for withholding the
Federal share of Medicaid payments will begin in 15 days if the FI does
not receive the cost report.**

The FI shall continue sending demand letters to the provider. (Chapter
4, §20 for the requirements for the second and third demand letters) The
demand letters must be sent at 30-day intervals where the provider has
not responded even though the procedures for withholding the Federal
share of Medicaid payments have been initiated.) This must be done so
that if recoupment efforts and the withholding of Medicaid payments are
not effective, the case will be ready for referral to the Department of
Treasury.

**40 -- Recovery of Claims Accounts Receivables from the Provider - FI
(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

Intermediary claims A/R arises from adjustments in the intermediary's
claim processing systems (this type of adjustment may also be referred
to as a carryover adjustment). Some of the reasons these adjustments
occur include the duplicative processing of a claim, payment of a claim
at the wrong Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) rate, a request from a
provider, a determination by the intermediary that an adjustment was
required, or an adjustment created from a credit balance report,
CMS-838. These adjustments are normally recovered through the recoupment
of future claims and the recovered amounts are included in the
remittance advices to the providers. For additional information see
Chapter 4, §70.15.2.

**40.1 -- Demand Letter Contents**\
**(Rev. 315, Issued: 05-17-19, Effective: 06-18- 19, Implementation:
06-18-19)**

The term Medicare beneficiary identifier (Mbi) is a general term
describing a beneficiary's Medicare identification number. For purposes
of this manual, Medicare beneficiary identifier references both the
Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) and the Medicare Beneficiary
Identifier (MBI) during the new Medicare card transition period and
after for certain business areas that will continue to use the HICN as
part of their processes.

The FI will demand an overpayment resulting from a claims adjustment if
the claims adjustment has had no recoupment in the past 60 days.

The demand letter must include the following information:

> •That an overpayment was made;
>
> •That interest will begin to accrue if the overpayment is not paid in
> full within 30 days;
>
> •The name and Medicare beneficiary identifier of the beneficiary
> involved;
>
> •The dates and types of services for which the overpayment was made to
> include sufficient information for the provider to identify the
> overpayment;
>
> •How the overpayment was calculated;
>
> •Why it is liable for recovery of overpayment (i.e., the reasons for
> finding the provider at fault);
>
> •That recoupment of the overpayment from all available payments is
> occurring;
>
> •A reference to the Appeals rights in the remittance advice;

**40.2- Sample Demand Letter for Claims Accounts Receivables (Rev. 41,
04-30-04)**

Below is a sample demand letter that FIs may use when demanding Claims
Accounts Receivables. The Extended Repayment Plan enclosure can be found
at Chapter 4, §20, Exhibit 2.

Name/Address

Re: Provider Number\
Claims Accounts Receivable

Dear \_\_\_\_\_:

On \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, a claim adjustment was entered in our
system under provider \_\_\_\_\_ for\
\$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Since then, adjustments were made to the claim
and a balance in the amount of \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ has been
outstanding for 60 days. As this amount has not been recouped through
claims submission, the purpose of our letter is to request that this
amount be repaid to our office. For your reference, a copy of the Claims
Accounts Receivable Transaction Summary is enclosed. (Insert the name of
the detailed summary report enclosed. This report should include
sufficient information needed by the provider to identify the
overpayment).

Submit your check payable to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, to the
following address:

In order to ensure that your check is credited to this overpayment,
please enclose a copy of this letter with your payment.

Until payment in full is received or an acceptable extended repayment
request is received all payments due to you are being withheld. (This
includes claims, settlement amounts, or interim payments.) If you have
reason to believe that withhold should cease you must notify our office
before \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and provide documentation as to why this
withholding action should not continue. We will review your
documentation, but will not delay recoupment during the review process.
This is not an appeal of the overpayment determination.

In addition, in accordance with 42 C.F.R. §405.378, simple interest at
the rate of \_\_\_\_% will be charged on the unpaid balance of the
overpayment, beginning on the 31st day. Interest is calculated in 30-day
periods and is assessed for each full 30-day period that payment is not
made on time. Thus, if payment is received 31 days from the date of this
letter, one 30-day period of interest will be charged. Each payment will
be applied first to accrued interest and the remaining amount to
principal.

Additional interest of \$\_\_\_ will be assessed against the principal
balance on \_\_\_\_ and will continue to assess at the rate of \_\_\_% a
year for each 30-day period the principal amount remains unpaid. In
addition, please note that Medicare rules require that payment be either
received in our office by \_\_\_ or United States Postal Service
postmarked by that date in order for the payment to be considered
timely. A metered mail postmark received in our office after \_\_\_ will
cause an additional month's interest to be assessed on the debt.

We request that you refund this amount in full. If you are unable to
make refund of the entire amount at this time, please advise our office
immediately so that we may determine if you are eligible for a repayment
schedule (See enclosure for details). Any repayment schedule (where one
is approved) would run from the date of this letter. If we do not hear
from you, your interim payments will continue to be withheld and applied
towards the outstanding overpayment balance. Any amount withheld will
not be refunded.

If you feel you have reason to appeal this adjustment, please refer to
the original remittance advice dated \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for additional
instruction.

If you have filed a bankruptcy petition or are involved in a bankruptcy
proceeding, Medicare financial obligations will be resolved in
accordance with the applicable bankruptcy process. Accordingly, we
request that you immediately notify us about this bankruptcy so that we
may coordinate with both the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
and the Department of Justice so as to assure that we handle your
situation properly. If possible, when notifying us about the bankruptcy,
please include the name the bankruptcy was filed under and the district
where the bankruptcy is filed.

If you have a question regarding why these adjustments were made, please
contact our \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. If we can assist
you further in the resolution of this matter, we will be glad to do so.
We look forward to hearing from you shortly.

Sincerely,

(name and title)

**50 - Recovery of Overpayments When a Provider Changes Its FI- FI Only
(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

Where CMS approves a change of FI, the change is effective on the first
day following the close of the fiscal year in which the provider gave
timely notice. (See Medicare Claims Processing, Chapter 1, General
Billing Requirements.)

**50.1 Action By Outgoing FI**

**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

The outgoing FI is responsible for effectuating final settlement for the
cost report periods during which it serviced the provider. It issues the
reminder letter to ensure the timely receipt of the cost report as well
as any NPRs and demand letters. The outgoing FI is also responsible for
assuring that the incoming FI is aware of the outstanding overpayment
and that recoupment is initiated by the\
withholding of interim payments, if necessary. If the overpayment
remains uncollected, the outgoing FI is responsible for initiating the
withholding of Title XIX payments (Medicaid) and for referring the
overpayment to the Department of Treasury. The outgoing FI must copy the
incoming FI on all correspondence with the provider to ensure a timely
collection process.

**A. Notification to Incoming FI**

**When the outgoing FI is notified by the RO that the provider\'s
request for a change of FI has been approved, it shall notify the
incoming FI in writing of all outstanding program overpayments. It shall
include:**

> •The cost reporting period;
>
> •The date the overpayment was determined;

•Explanation of the type of overpayment, e.g., cost report overpayment -
desk review, cost report overpayment - audit;

•The current status of collection action, including any withhold that is
currently in place to recoup the overpayment; and

•The original balance of the overpayment and the current principal and
interest balance of the overpayment.

The outgoing FI should also notify the incoming FI of future settlements
that will be occurring and of any unfiled cost reports.

B. Notice of Intent to Suspend Interim Payments

If at the time of the change of FI the outgoing FI is recouping an
overpayment by the withholding of interim payments the incoming FI will
continue the withhold. The outgoing FI must notify the provider that the
withhold will be continued by the incoming FI until the overpayment is
liquidated or an acceptable ERS is approved. In addition, the outgoing
FI must notify the incoming FI of the details of the withhold.

If after the change of FI occurs the outgoing FI determines that an
overpayment exists the outgoing FI must notify the provider in
accordance with normal procedures. The current FI should receive a copy
of all NPRs and demand letters. The outgoing FI must contact the current
FI to make sure that recoupment begins when necessary.

**50.2 -- Action by Incoming FI**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

The incoming FI is responsible for effectuating final settlements for
the cost report periods after the change of FI becomes effective. If the
FI receives a cost report from a prior period it should forward it to
the outgoing FI to make the final settlement. If the outgoing FI is no
longer participating in the Medicare program, the incoming FI shall
contact the RO for further instructions.

After the outgoing FI has completed its review of the cost report, it
notifies the incoming FI whether the cost report is acceptable, and the
final settlement. The incoming FI, in accordance with Ch. 4, §40,
disposes of funds withheld during the suspension of interim payments
(for an unfiled cost report) and initiates recoupment by the withhold of
interim payments if necessary.

While overpayments are outstanding at the outgoing FI, the incoming FI
must keep the outgoing FI up to date regarding the provider's location
and participation in the Medicare program. If the incoming FI learns of
a provider's termination from the Medicare program it must notify the
outgoing FI so that it may act accordingly.

**A. Reduction of Outstanding Overpayment**

Any actions taken by the incoming FI which reduce or eliminate the
overpayment made by the outgoing FI shall be communicated, in writing,
to the outgoing FI within 5 working days after the month in which the
actions occurred. In addition, unless the provider indicates to the
contrary, any collections or payment are applied first to the earliest
overpayment. See Chapter 5, Financial Reporting for\
instructions on transferring any payment(s) between FIs.

**60 - Interim Rate Adjustments and Periodic Interim Payment Adjustments
-- FI only (Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

The interest provisions of Chapter 4, §30 do not apply to FI
overpayments or underpayments determined as a result of interim rate and
periodic interim payment (PIP) adjustments or utilization reviews. If
necessary, an interim rate or periodic interim payment adjustment shall
occur prior to the end of the cost

reporting year. When this occurs, the interim rate or periodic interim
rate is adjusted for the remainder of the cost reporting year in order
to have aggregate payments approximate total allowable costs. This
adjustment is based on any overpayment or underpayment determined as a
result of the interim review. Since payments are adjusted, this
overpayment or underpayment should not exist at the end of the cost
reporting year.

If the adjustment of the payments would provide a hardship to the
provider and an extended repayment plan is requested instead, interest
shall accrue on the overpayment. The interest rate charged shall be the
rate in effect on the date the notice of payment adjustment was sent to
the provider unless a specific instruction is issued as in the case of
Interim Payment System (IPS) recoveries for FY 1998 & 1999 (Transmittal
A-99-47). This is true for any entity that is reimbursed in such a way
that interim rate adjustments and/or periodic interim payment
adjustments are required.

If the review is completed after the end of the cost reporting year or
after the cost report is filed, adjustments to the interim or periodic
rate are not possible. In this case any determined overpayment or
underpayment shall be considered in conjunction with the final
settlement. By taking the overpayment or underpayment into consideration
with the tentative or final settlement the FI will issue a tentative
settlement payment, tentative settlement demand letter, or Notice of
Program Reimbursement. When a demand letter or Notice of Program
Reimbursement is issued, interest will be assessed if necessary, and the
provider will be notified of it's appeal rights. Any determined
overpayment shall then be recouped.

**70 -- Determining Liability and Waiver of Recovery for Overpayments**

**(Rev. 294, Issued: 10-06-17, Effective: 07-03-17, Implementation:
07-03-17)**

The Medicare law contains three provisions (§1870, §1879 and §1842(l))
dealing with liability for, and recovery of, individual overpayments.
These provisions do not cover cost report overpayments. These provisions
are reflected below and, for a more extensive treatment, in Medicare
Claims Processing Manual, Publication 100-04, Chapter 31, Financial
Liability Protections.

The contractor shall determine whether the provider, physician, or
beneficiary is liable for the overpayment. Most contractor payments for
provider services are made to providers on behalf of the beneficiaries
who received the services. If payment is made directly to the
beneficiary, liability always lies with the beneficiary unless recovery
is waived under the limitation of liability provision. Where the
provider or physician has been overpaid, it is liable for the
overpayment unless the contractor determines that it was without fault
with respect to the overpayment.

If the contractor determines that an overpaid provider or physician was
without fault and therefore not liable for the overpayment, it relieves
the provider of liability for the overpayment. The beneficiary
automatically becomes liable, whether or not the beneficiary was at
fault.

However, recovery from the beneficiary may be waived if you determine
the beneficiary is without fault and recovery would defeat the purposes
of Title II or Title XVIII or would be against equity and good
conscience.

**70.1- 1879 Determination -- Limitation of Liability**

**(Rev. 294, Issued: 10-06-17, Effective: 07-03-17, Implementation:
07-03-17)**

Section 1879 of the Social Security Act (the Act) provides financial
relief to beneficiaries, providers, practitioners, and other suppliers
who acted in good faith in accepting or providing services found to be
not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness
or injury or to improve the

functioning of a malformed body member, or to constitute custodial care.
The provision applies to all Part A/Part B claims decisions where claims
are denied or reduced (prepay or postpay) under §1862(a) (9) and §1879
(e) and (g) of the Act.

Contractors must make an individualized determination for each claim
that is denied as not reasonable and necessary. (See Medicare Program
Integrity Manual (PIM), Publication 100-08, Exhibits, §14.1)

**A. Limitation on Liability -- Indemnification Procedures for Claims
Filed under Part B**

Section 1879(b) of the Act provides that, when a physician/supplier is
held liable for the payment of expenses incurred by a beneficiary for
items or services determined to be excluded and such\
physician/supplier requests and received payment from the beneficiary or
any person(s) who assumed financial responsibility for payment of
expenses, the Medicare program will indemnify the beneficiary or other
person(s) for any payments made to the liable physician/supplier
(including deductible and coinsurance payments). Further, any such
indemnification payments are considered overpayments to the
physician/supplier. (See PIM Exhibits, §14.1.)

**B. Limitation on Liability Where Physician and Beneficiary Did Not
Have Prior Knowledge With Respect to Services Found To Be Not Reasonable
And Necessary Services (§1879 of Act)**

When both the physician and the beneficiary did not have prior knowledge
with respect to services found to be not reasonable and necessary,
permit Medicare payment to be made under the limitation on liability
provision. (See Medicare Program Integrity Manual (PIM), Publication
100-08, Exhibits, §14.1) An overpayment does not exist if a
determination is made that the limitation of liability provision
applies. The claim decision must incorporate a limitation of liability
determination.

**70.2 - 1842(l) Determination**

**(Rev. 294, Issued: 10-06-17, Effective: 07-03-17, Implementation:
07-03-17)**

For denials of nonassigned claims based on §1862(a)(1) involving
physician services, the contractor must make a determination under
§1842(l) of the Act regarding whether the physician or supplier must
refund any payment collected from the beneficiary. This should be done
for initial determinations (prepay) and for postpayment denials. (See
Medicare Program Integrity Manual (PIM), Publication 100-08, Exhibits,
§14.3)

**70.3 - 1870 Determination -- Waiver of Recovery of an Overpayment**

**(Rev. 294, Issued: 10-06-17, Effective: 07-03-17, Implementation:
07-03-17)**

Once the contractor has concluded that an overpayment exists (that is, a
finding that payment cannot be made under the waiver of liability
provisions) it makes a §1870(b) determination regarding whether the
provider/beneficiary was without fault with respect to the overpayment.
Once this determination has been made, then waiver of recovery of the
overpayment from the provider/beneficiary should be considered per
§1870(c).

The contractors make a §1870 determination for all assigned and
non-assigned claims, however, §1870 (b) or (c) of the Act, does not
apply to the provider on non-assigned post-payment §1862(a)(1) denied
claims. However, it can apply to the beneficiary meaning that the
beneficiary was not at fault in causing

the overpayment. The provider may have a refund obligation to the
beneficiary, but the provider did not receive an overpayment from the
Medicare program.

Section 1870 is not limited to claims denied under §1862(a)(1) of the
Act for not being reasonable and necessary. Section 1870 is the
framework for determining who is liable for the overpayment and whether
the overpayment recovery can be waived. For providers taking assignment,
waiving recovery of an overpayment is appropriate where the provider was
without fault with respect to causing the overpayment. Where recovery
from the provider is waived per 1870(c), the overpayment becomes an
overpayment to the beneficiary. However, if the provider was "at fault"
in causing the overpayment, recovery of the overpayment from the
provider must proceed. Section 1870 waiver of recovery determinations
also must be made where the provider mistakenly receives direct payment
on an unassigned claim and this is the basis for the overpayment.

**Examples of §1870 determinations:**

**A**. **Overpaid Provider or Physician Not Liable Because It Was
Without Fault (§1870(b) of the Act.)**

If a provider was without fault with respect to an overpayment it
received (or is deemed without fault, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary, because the overpayment was discovered subsequent to the fifth
calendar year after the year of payment) it is not liable for the
overpayment; therefore, it is not responsible for refunding the amount
involved. The contractor makes these determinations.

**B.Beneficiary Liable for Overpayments to Provider That Was Without
Fault With Respect to the Overpayment (§§1870(a) and (b) of the Act)**

If an overpaid provider was without fault, or is deemed without fault
and therefore not liable for refund, liability shifts to the
beneficiary. If the overpayment involves services that are not
reasonable and necessary, you should have made a §1879 determination
regarding the beneficiary's liability for the overpayment. If the
overpayment does not involve medically unnecessary services, then
limitation on liability does not apply.

**C. Contractor Waiver of Recovery from Beneficiary (§1870(c) of the
Act)**

If a beneficiary is liable for an incorrect payment, recovery may be
waived if the beneficiary was without fault with respect to the
overpayment and recovery would defeat the purposes of title II or title
XVIII of the Social Security Act (i.e., cause financial hardship) or
would be against equity and good conscience. (Where an overpayment is
discovered subsequent to the fifth calendar year after the year the
payment was made, recovery is deemed against equity and good conscience
if the beneficiary was without fault.)

If §1879 of the Act is applicable, then §1879 determination is made
first since an overpayment does not exist if payment can be made under
§1879 because there was lack of knowledge by both the beneficiary and
the provider.

**80 -- Individual Overpayments Discovered Subsequent to the Fifth
Year**

**(Rev. 294, Issued: 10-06-17, Effective: 07-03-17, Implementation:
07-03-17)**

There are special rules that apply when an overpayment is discovered
subsequent to the fifth year following the year in which notice was sent
that the amount was paid. Ordinarily, the provider or

beneficiary will be considered without fault unless there is evidence to
the contrary. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the contractor
will not demand and recover the determined overpayment. (One example of
evidence to the contrary would be a pattern of billing errors. See
Medicare Program Integrity Manual, Publication (PIM) 100-08, Chapter 3.)

**EXAMPLE 1:** On May 9, 2016 Dr. A is notified that he has been paid
\$1005.00 for services provided to Mr. Smith, beneficiary. On January 6,
2022 the contractor determines that Dr. A was overpaid for the services
to Mr. Smith, beneficiary. The contractor will not recover this
overpayment as long as there is no evidence to the contrary because it
was determined subsequent to the fifth year after notification of
payment. (Any determination date on or after Jan. 1, 2022 will not be
recovered.)(If evidence to the contrary existed, recoupment may be
initiated. The PIM should be referenced and if necessary the appropriate
Benefits Integrity unit at the contractor for guidance.)\
**EXAMPLE 2:** On May 9, 2016 Dr. A is notified that he has been paid
\$1005.00 for services provided to Mr. Smith, beneficiary. On September
20, 2019 the contractor determines that Dr. A was overpaid for the
services to Mr. Smith, beneficiary. The contractor will attempt recovery
of the overpayment. (Any determination dates up to and including Dec.
31, 2021 will be recovered.)

**80.1 -- How to Determine the Fifth Calendar Year after the Year the
Payment Was Approved**

**(Rev. 294, Issued: 10-06-17, Effective: 07-03-17, Implementation:
07-03-17)**

Only the year of the payment and the year it was found to be an
overpayment enter into the\
determination of the 5-calendar year period. The day and the month are
irrelevant. With respect to payments made in 2016, the fifth calendar
year thereafter is 2021. For payments made in 2017, the fifth calendar
year thereafter is 2022, etc. Thus, the rules apply to payments made in
2016 and discovered to be overpayments after 2021, to payments made in
2017 and discovered to be overpayments after 2022, etc.

Where an overpayment to a provider, or a physician assignee for
medically unnecessary services or custodial care is discovered (i.e.,
demanded) subsequent to the fifth calendar year after the year in which
the payment was approved, the provider or physician assignee is
prohibited from charging the\
beneficiary or any other person for the services notwithstanding the
fact that the provider or physician assignee has refunded the
overpayment if:

• The provider or physician assignee was at fault with respect to the
overpayment; and

• The beneficiary was without fault with respect to the overpayment.
(Where the overpayment is discovered in, or before, the fifth calendar
year, an \"at fault\" provider or physician assignee is not prohibited
from charging the beneficiary for the overpayment if it has refunded it.
However, a without fault beneficiary who pays an at fault provider\'s or
physician assignee's bill for medically unnecessary services or
custodial care, can be indemnified in accordance with Medicare Claims
Processing Manual, Publication 100-04, Chapter 30, Financial Liability
Protections.

[Reopenings]{.underline} (See Medicare Claims Processing Manual,
Publication 100-04, Chapter 29 Appeals of Claims Decisions for
additional information)

Your initial, or review determination or a decision by a Hearing Officer
may be reopened under the following conditions:

Within 12 months after the date of the determination or decision it may
be reopened for any reason;

After such 12-month period, but within 4 years after the date of the
initial determination, it may be reopened for good cause; or

At any time, if:

\- Such initial or review determination was procured by fraud or similar
fault of the beneficiary or some other person.

If an overpayment is determined based on a reopening outside of the
above parameters, the contractor will not recover the overpayment.

**80.2 - Recovery of Overpayment Due to Overdue Cost Report (Rev. 294,
Issued: 10-06-17, Effective: 07-03-17, Implementation: 07-03-17)**

Where CMS approves a change of contractor, the change is effective on
the first day following the close of the fiscal year in which the
provider gave timely notice. (See Pub 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing
Manual, Publication 100-04, Chapter 1, General Billing Requirements.)

**A. Reminder Letter**

The outgoing contractor is responsible for effecting final settlement
for the cost report periods during which it serviced the provider. It
issues the reminder letter required under §30.1 to ensure the timely
receipt of the cost report.

**B. First Demand Letter**

If no cost report has been filed by the first day after the due date of
the cost report (including\
extensions), the outgoing contractor sends the first demand letter in
Medicare Financial Management Manual, Publication 100-06, Chapter 4,
Debt Collection, §20.2, Exhibit l, Column B. It sends copies of the
reminder letter and the first demand letter to the RO and incoming
contractor. Upon receipt of its copy of the letter, the incoming
contractor suspends the interim payment.

**C. Second Demand Letter**

The outgoing contractor is responsible for personal contact with the
provider, issuing the second demand letter, and notifying the RO if
appropriate. The contractor shall issue a "modified Intent to Refer
(ITR) Letter for Unfiled Cost Reports," if the provider has not filed
the cost report and the overpayment balance has not been paid. (See
Medicare Financial Management Manual, Publication 100-06, Chapter 4,
§20.2 Exhibit 7 for a sample intent letter)

**D. Receipt of Delinquent Cost Report**

If the delinquent cost report is sent to the incoming contractor, it
sends the cost report to the outgoing contractor to make the final
settlement.

After the outgoing contractor has completed its review of the delinquent
cost report, it notifies the incoming contractor whether the cost report
is acceptable, and the final settlement. The incoming

contractor, in accordance with Medicare Financial Management Manual,
Publication 100-06, Chapter 4, §40.1, disposes of funds withheld during
the suspension of interim payments.

**90 - Provider, Physician, or Other Supplier Liability**\
**(Rev. 275, Issued: 11-18-16, Effective: 02-21-17, Implementation:
02-21-17)**

A provider, physician, or other supplier is liable for overpayments it
received unless it is found to be without fault. The contractor, as
applicable, makes this determination.

The contractor considers a provider, physician, or other supplier
without fault, if it exercised reasonable care in billing for, and
accepting, the payment; i.e.,

> • It made full disclosure of all material facts; and\
> • On the basis of the information available to it, including, but not
> limited to, the Medicare instructions and regulations, it had a
> reasonable basis for assuming that the payment was correct, or, if it
> had reason to question the payment; it promptly brought the question
> to the contractor's attention.

Normally, it will be clear from the circumstances whether the provider,
physician, or other supplier was without fault in causing the
overpayment. Where it is not clear, the contractor shall develop the
issue.

**90.1 -Examples of Situations in Which Provider, Physician, or Other
Supplier Is Liable**\
**(Rev. 275, Issued: 11-18-16, Effective: 02-21-17, Implementation:
02-21-17)**

In accordance with §90 the following are examples of situations in which
the provider, physician, or other supplier is liable for an overpayment
it received.

**A. The Provider, Physician, or Other Supplier Furnished Erroneous
Information or Failed to Disclose Facts That It Knew or Should Have
Known, Were Relevant to Payment of the Benefit.**

This includes, among others, situations in which a provider, physician,
or other supplier failed to report any additional payments he may have
received from the beneficiary and situations in which a provider,
physician, or other supplier failed to request applicable information
from the beneficiary including, but not limited to, information needed
by the contractor to identify cases in which Medicare may be secondary
payer, or if it did request such information, it failed to annotate the
billing form.

(Providers**, Physician, or Other Supplier** are instructed to ask
beneficiaries for, and to annotate the claims form with, information
needed to help the contractor identify cases in which Medicare may be
secondary payer, e.g., information about the circumstances of the
illness or injury and the availability of benefits under an insurance
policy or plan.) (See Medicare Claims Processing, chapter 29,
Coordination With Medigap Insurers.)

**EXAMPLE:** A provider, physician, or other supplier submitted an
assigned claim showing total fees of \$600. The provider, physician, or
other supplier did not indicate on the CMS-1500 that any portion of the
bill had been paid. After the deductible and coinsurance you determined
the amount owed to the provider, physician, or other supplier was \$480
on the assumption that the provider, physician, or other supplier had
received no other payment. You later learned that the beneficiary had
paid the provider, physician, or other supplier \$200 before the
provider, physician, or other supplier submitted his claim. Thus, the
payment should have been split; i.e., \$400 should have been paid to the
provider, physician, or

other supplier and \$80 to the beneficiary. The provider, physician, or
other supplier was at fault in causing the \$80 overpayment since he
failed to inform you of the amount he had received from the beneficiary.

**B. Provider, Physician, or Other Supplier Receives Duplicate
Payments.**

This includes the following situations:

> • Provider, physician, or other supplier is overpaid because the
> contractor processed the\
> provider's, physician's, or other supplier's claim more than once. If
> an overpayment to a provider, physician, or other supplier is caused
> by multiple processing of the same charge (e.g., through overlapping
> or duplicate bills), the provider, physician, or other supplier does
> not have a reasonable basis for assuming that the total payment the
> provider, physician, or other supplier received was correct and thus
> should have questioned it. The provider, physician, or other supplier
> is, therefore, at fault and liable for the overpayment.
>
> • Provider, physician, or other supplier received payment from
> Medicare on the basis of an assignment and a beneficiary received
> payment on an itemized bill and turned the beneficiary payment over to
> the provider, physician, or other supplier. The provider, physician,
> or other supplier is liable for only the portion of the total amount
> paid in excess of the provider's, physician's, or other supplier's
> portion of the allowable amount. The beneficiary is liable for the
> balance of the overpayment. However, if the beneficiary paid any
> portion of the coinsurance to the provider, physician, or other
> supplier, the provider, physician, or other supplier is liable for
> that amount also. If the provider, physician, or other supplier
> protests recovery of the\
> overpayment on the grounds that the provider, physician, or other
> supplier applied all or part of the check received from the
> beneficiary to amounts the beneficiary owed the provider, physician,
> or other supplier for other services, the beneficiary, rather than the
> provider, physician, or other supplier, is liable for refunding such
> amounts.

**EXAMPLE:** Dr. A and Mr. B each received duplicate payments of \$300
based on reasonable charges of \$375. Mr. B turned his \$300 over to Dr.
A. Thus, Dr. A received a total of \$600. Mr. B did not owe money to Dr.
A for other services. Dr. A is liable for \$225, which is the amount he
received in excess of the reasonable charge. Mr. B is liable for the
remaining \$75 of the duplicate payment. If Mr. B had previously paid
Dr. A the \$75 coinsurance, Dr. A is liable for the entire \$300
overpayment.

> • Provider, physician, or other supplier receives duplicate payments
> from Medicare and another insurer or plan (directly or through the
> beneficiary) which is the primary payer, i.e., an automobile medical
> or no-fault insurer, a liability insurer, a WC insurer, or, under
> certain circumstances, an EGHP. (See Medicare Claims Processing,
> Chapter 29, Coordination With Medigap Insurers.) The provider,
> physician, or other supplier is liable for the portion of the Medicare
> payment in excess of the amount Medicare is obligated to pay as
> secondary payer.
>
> (See Medicare Claims Processing, Chapter 29, Coordination With Medigap
> Insurers and/or Medicare Secondary Payer Manual.) However, if the
> provider, physician, or other supplier turns the other insurance
> payment over to the beneficiary, the beneficiary is liable.

**C. The Overpayment Resulted Through Misapplication of the Deductible
or Coinsurance Requirement or Payment After Exhaustion of Benefits and
the Provider, Physician, or Other Supplier Could Have Known From Its Own
Records the Beneficiary\'s Utilization Status**

Part A provider, physician, or other supplier is considered liable if it
received a remittance record within the 60 days preceding billing
indicating deductible and benefit status. This condition is considered
met where, within the 60-day period preceding the admission that gave
rise to the overpayment, the beneficiary had been a patient in the same
institution or the provider, physician, or other supplier could have
known the beneficiary\'s utilization status from its own records.

The provider, physician, or other supplier is expected to ask the
beneficiary, or the person acting on the beneficiary's behalf, at the
time of admission if the beneficiary received inpatient services in a
hospital or SNF within the past 60 days, and note the response on its
records.

**EXAMPLE:** John Doe entered University Hospital on January 10, 2000.
After using all of his benefit days, including lifetime reserve days, he
returned home, but reentered the same hospital in fewer than 60 days and
stayed an additional 30 days. University Hospital neglected to check its
records and billed the contractor for 30 days of inpatient hospital
care. The contractor made payment. Subsequently, the overpayment was
discovered. Since the hospital should have known from its own records
that Mr. Doe had exhausted his benefit days, the contractor shall seek
recovery from the hospital.

If the previous stay had been in a different hospital, or if more than
60 days had elapsed between the end of the first stay and the start of
the second stay but the benefit period had remained unbroken because
John had been in an SNF or a different hospital, the contractor would
consider University Hospital \"without fault.\" In this latter
situation, the hospital would not have been able to ascertain from its
own records that benefit days had been exhausted. The contractor would
seek recovery from the beneficiary.

**D. The Overpayment Was Due to a Mathematical or Clerical Error.**

Examples:

> • Error in calculation by the contractor in calculating
> reimbursement;\
> • Error by the provider, physician, or other supplier in calculating
> charges, or • Overlapping or duplicate bills.

Mathematical error does not include a failure to properly assess the
coinsurance and/or deductible. The contractor would determine the
liability for coinsurance and deductible overpayments in accordance with
D. above. Where payment to a provider, physician, or other supplier was
based on a deductible amount, the provider, physician, or other supplier
is without fault. Seek recovery from the beneficiary.

**E. The Provider, Physician, or Other Supplier Does Not Submit
Documentation to Substantiate That Services Billed to the Program Were
Covered.**

**F. The Provider, Physician, or Other Supplier Does Not Submit
Documentation to Substantiate That It Performed the Services Billed to
the Program Where There Is a Question as to Whether the Services Were
Performed.**

(See the Program Integrity Manual, which can be found at the following
Internet address:\
https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs.html,
if fraud is suspected.)

**G. The Beneficiary Was Not Entitled to Part A Benefits and the
Provider, Physician, or Other Supplier Had Reason to Believe That the
Beneficiary Was Not Entitled to Such Benefits.**

For example, the Social Security Office notified the hospital that the
individual was not entitled to hospital insurance benefits.

**H. The Provider, Physician, or Other Supplier Billed, or Medicare Paid
the Provider, Physician, or Other Supplier for Services that the
Provider, Physician, or Other Supplier Should Have Known Were
Noncovered.**

1\. Services Other Than Medically Unnecessary or Custodial Services,
e.g., skilled physical therapy services furnished by a nonqualified
physical therapist, or services rendered pursuant to an authorization
from the VA. (See Medicare Benefit Policy, Chapter 17, Exclusions.)

In general, the provider, physician, or other supplier should have known
about a policy or rule, if:

> • The policy or rule is in the provider, physician, or other supplier
> manual or in Federal regulations;
>
> • CMS or a CMS contractor provided general notice to the medical
> community concerning the policy or rule;
>
> • CMS, a CMS contractor, or the OIG gave written notice of the policy
> or rule to the particular provider, physician, or other supplier;
>
> • The provider, physician, or other supplier was previously
> investigated or audited as a result of not following the policy or
> rule;
>
> • The provider, physician, or other supplier previously agreed to a
> Corporate Integrity Agreement as a result of not following the policy
> or rule;
>
> • The provider, physician, or other supplier was previously informed
> that its claims had been reviewed/denied as a result of the claims not
> meeting certain Medicare requirements, which are related to the policy
> or rule; or
>
> • The provider, physician, or other supplier previously received
> documented training/outreach from CMS or one its contractors related
> to the same policy or rule.

Generally, a provider\'s, physician's, or other supplier's allegation
that it was not at fault with respect to payment for noncovered services
because it was not aware of the Medicare coverage provisions is not a
basis for finding it without fault if any of the above conditions is
met. However, there may be other circumstances that justify a finding
that the provider, physician, or other supplier was not at fault. The
contractor shall consider all of the circumstances, including such
factors as whether and to what extent a coverage rule is spelled out in
regulations, instructions, or in a CMS notice, and whether a contractor
misinformed the provider, physician, or other supplier about the rule;
in deciding whether a provider, physician, or other supplier acted
reasonably in billing for and accepting payment for noncovered services.

2\. Medically Unnecessary or Custodial Services.

The contractor shall apply the criteria in Medicare Claims Processing,
Chapter 30, Financial Liability Protection in determining whether the
provider, physician, or other supplier should have known that the
services were not covered.

**I. The Overpayment Resulted From Services Rendered in a
Nonparticipating**\
**Portion of the Facility or in a Bed Certified for a Type of Care Other
Than That Furnished.**

**J. The Physician Was Paid but Did Not Accept Assignment.**

**The physician is liable whether or not the beneficiary had also been
paid.**

**K. Overpayment Was for Rental of Durable Medical Equipment and
Supplier Billed Under the One-Time Authorization Procedure.**

Pursuant to Medicare Claims Processing, Chapter 20, suppliers of durable
medical equipment who have accepted assignment may be reimbursed for
rental items on the basis of a one-time authorization by the
beneficiary; i.e., without the need to obtain the beneficiary's
signature each month. A supplier using the procedure must have filed
with the carrier a statement that it assumes unconditional
responsibility for rental overpayments for periods after the
beneficiary\'s death or while he was institutionalized or while he no
longer needed or used the equipment.

**L. Items or Services Were Furnished by Practitioner or Supplier not
Qualified for Medicare Reimbursement**

Two examples of such services are:

> • A laboratory test performed by a nonqualified independent

**90.2 - Provider, Physician, or Other Supplier Protests Its Liability
(Rev. 275, Issued: 11-18-16, Effective: 02-21-17, Implementation:
02-21-17)**

A provider's, physician's, or other supplier's reply to a notification
that the provider, physician, or other supplier is liable for an
overpayment may indicate dissatisfaction with some aspect of the
overpayment decision. Such a protest shall be considered a request for
an appeal. In most instances, this will be a redetermination which is
the first level of appeal for an overpayment determination. However, if
the overpayment is identified during the course of the redetermination,
the contractor shall consider the provider's, physician's, or other
supplier's protest as a request for reconsideration by the qualified
independent contractor (QIC). In conducting the appeal, the contractor
shall consider whether

a\. There was an overpayment;\
b. The amount of the overpayment was correctly calculated; and whether,

The provider, physician, or other supplier is liable for repayment.

**100 - Beneficiary Liability**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

A beneficiary is liable for:

> •Overpayments made to a provider that was without fault with the
> exception of\
> overpayments for medically unnecessary services or custodial care
> where the beneficiary, as well as the provider, was without fault.
> (See Medicare Claims Processing, Chapter 30, Limitation on Liability.)
>
> •Situations in which Medicare pays a provider, and a WC carrier,
> automobile medical, or no-fault insurer or any liability insurer; or
> EGHP pays primary benefits to the beneficiary for the same services.
> (See Medicare Secondary Payer Manual)
>
> •Overpayments made to the beneficiary.

**110 - Recovery Where the Beneficiary Is Liable for the Overpayment
(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

When the FI or carrier has determined the beneficiary to be liable for
the overpayment, it shall initiate recovery efforts in accordance with
the following sections, as appropriate. The chart below is meant to be a
guide. The actual sections shall be reviewed for additional guidance.

**110.1 - Recovery Where the Beneficiary Is Covered Under Medicaid or
Another Health Insurance Plan, Private or Governmental**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

When the FI or carrier determines the beneficiary is liable, and the
beneficiary carries supplemental health insurance or is covered by
another Government health benefits program such as Medicaid, TRICARE,
CHAMPVA, or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, it may be
possible to recover the overpayment from the other plan or program.
Payments of deductible or coinsurance amounts and payment for services
rendered persons who are not entitled to Medicare are the payments most
likely to be recoverable.

If, based on the circumstances of the overpayment and FI or carrier
knowledge of the other plan or program, the FI or carrier believes there
is a possibility that the other plan will refund the overpayment, it
shall attempt to recover from the other plan or program. In this
connection, it may be necessary to ask the beneficiary for their policy
number or other information concerning their non-Medicare coverage.

(See Medicare Claims Processing , Chapter 28, Coordination With Medigap,
Medicaid, and Other Complementary Insurers, for procedures to follow
where the overpayment is for services that should have been paid for by
a WC carrier.)

To facilitate recovery of the Medicare overpayments to the extent
possible, where another plan or program is involved, the FI or carrier
shall attempt to work out mutually satisfactory arrangements with the
other carrier(s). In negotiations with Medicaid agencies or carriers, it
may be helpful for the FI or carrier to point out that Medicare will
refund directly to Medicaid agencies overpayments for services
reimbursed on a charge basis.

The methods listed below have been used successfully. The FI or carrier
shall use any one or a combination, as it finds appropriate. The most
desirable method in a given situation depends upon the particular
circumstances, and the provisions of the other plan or program.

•The FI or carrier shall arrange with the other plan or program for
direct refund of overpayments to it. If the FI or carrier is also the
carrier under the other plan or program, a transfer of funds is the most
convenient method of recovering. If another insurance carrier is
involved, the FI or carrier shall send the other insurance carrier a
letter requesting refund of the overpayment. The letter should explain
how the overpayment occurred and how it was calculated. The FI or
carrier shall follow up in 30 days with another letter or a phone call
if payment or a letter of explanation has not been received. If this
does not bring a meaningful response, it shall write to the President or
Chief Administrative Officer of the other carrier.

•If the FI or carrier does not use the above method for provider
overpayments, it shall arrange with the other plan or program to make
payment to overpaid provider upon the FI's or carrier's request, (even
though the provider has not billed the other plan or program) and to
notify the FI or carrier of the payment. Upon receiving such a notice,
the FI or carrier shall recover the Medicare overpayment from the
provider.

•Where neither of the above methods is possible, the FI or carrier shall
ask the provider if it would be willing to refund the overpayment and to
bill the other plan or program, with the understanding that if it is
unable to obtain payment, the FI or carrier will refund the amount
recovered to the provider. If the provider does not agree to refund the
overpayment before collecting from the other plan or program, the FI or
carrier shall ask it to bill the other plan or program and to use the
payment to refund the\
overpayment. If the FI or carrier receives notice that a provider (or a
beneficiary) plans to file a claim with another plan or program, it
shall suspend recovery efforts for a reasonable period.

If the FI or carrier has questions concerning the proper approach in
recovering from a welfare agency, or another insurance plan, it should
contact its RO.

> If efforts to recover the overpayment are not successful, or if the FI
> or carrier is certain that the other plan or program will not refund a
> particular overpayment, it shall seek recovery from the beneficiary in
> accordance with §110.2. It shall explain in the notice to the
> beneficiary that the other plan or program will not make payment
> directly to it. However, if the beneficiary is a Medicaid recipient,
> the FI or carrier shall not attempt recovery from the beneficiary.

> accordance with §110.9.

**A. Non-MSP Overpayment Is Less Than \$50**

Take no further recovery action. [Do not]{.underline} send a recovery
letter, or attempt recoupment. Also [do not]{.underline} refer case to
CMS for further collection efforts. See §160.2 for termination of
collection procedures.

> **B.** **Non-MSP Overpayment Amount Is \$50 or More**
>
> Upon discovering an overpayment of \$50 or more, send the beneficiary
> a recovery letter containing the information in §110.4.
>
> If there is no response within 30 days after sending the initial
> recovery letter and none of the conditions in §110.3 are present:
>
> 1\. Send a follow-up letter to the beneficiary, and
>
> 2\. Arrange to begin recoupment of the overpayment against any
> Medicare payments that become due the beneficiary on day 60.
>
> **C. Referral to SSA**
>
> To be considered for SSA referral the overpayment amount must be
> \$1000 or more and the beneficiary must be in current pay status. If,
> within 90 days of sending the initial demand letter, the overpayment
> has not been recovered and the individual has not requested a
> reconsideration, hearing or waiver (see §110.9) Prepare the case for
> referral to SSA for possible recovery from the individual\'s social
> security benefits.
>
> However, if the beneficiary has a Beneficiary Identification Code
> (BIC) that is either T or M, do not refer the case to SSA since those
> beneficiaries are not entitled to monthly social security benefits.
> Offset should be continued in the case of beneficiaries whose BIC is
> either T or M. If appropriate, the instructions for termination of
> collection action (See 110.3D for additional instructions.) should be
> followed.
>
> The FI or carrier should not refer an overpayment to SSA if it has
> knowledge that the beneficiary is deceased.
>
> When preparing the case for referral to SSA the following must be
> included in the case file:
>
> •Referral Form- contains the address of the referring agency (The
> Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Central Office, CMS
> Regional Office, or the Medicare Contractor and information pertaining
> to the case; and
>
> •Return Notice- for SSA use in recording information for crediting the
> CMS Trust Fund; and
>
> •Waiver Determination- if the Medicare Contractor or CMS RO determines
> the beneficiary was at fault for the overpayment.
>
> **NOTE:** The contractor's file must contain all overpayment
> notification letters and correspondence from the beneficiary and/or
> representative. Contractors may retrieve copies of the relevant forms
> from the servicing regional office or by accessing SSA's Program
> Operations Manual System at http://policy.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/poms.
> Access the HI section for Health Insurance and then the section number
> HI 022 titled Medicare Overpayments. Then access HI 02201 - Methods of
> Recovery for Title XVIII Overpayments and finally HI 02201.015 titled
> Appeal Requests and Refunds. The Beneficiary Overpayment Referral
> Notice is Exhibit A.

When an individual or his/her authorized representative receives notice
from SSA that a Medicare overpayment will be withheld from title II
benefits and protests the withholding, the protest applies only to the
deduction from his/her title II benefits. It does not apply to the
Medicare overpayment because the Medicare contractor has determined that
the overpayment must be recovered.

If SSA receives an appeal and/or waiver request, they must stop the
process of recovery. If the Medicare Contractor, CMS RO, or the
Administrative Law Judge has previously denied a waiver request, SSA
will then process the overpayment in accordance with current operating
procedures. If the individual has not requested waiver with the
contractor but files a waiver request with SSA, then SSA must return the
overpayment package to the appropriate contractor for processing.

When an individual or his/her representative goes to SSA to request a
waiver and/or an appeal of the Medicare Overpayment withholding, SSA
must complete the following forms, depending on the request:

> • Waiver- Form 632-BK (Request for Waiver of Overpayment and Recovery
> of Change in Repayment Rate)
>
> • Appeal of Withholding -- SSA-795 (Statement or Claimant or Other
> Person) since the rate of the withholding is not an initial
> determination, does not use the SSA-561 (Request for Reconsideration)
> or HA-501 (Request for Hearing).

**NOTE:** The referral of a Non-MSP beneficiary debt to SSA occurs
regardless of the classification of the debt for financial reporting.
Thus, a referral to SSA should occur even if the debt has been
reclassified to Currently Not Collectible(CNC).

**D. Beneficiary "Write-Off" between \$50- \$999.99**

If there has been "No Activity"(i.e. no recoupment) within a 12 month
period of a beneficiary Non-MSP overpayment that is between
\$50-\$999.99, verify that no collections are being made on any other
older debts for the same beneficiary before you make a recommendation
for write-off to the Regional Office. At the end of each Quarter compile
a list of all beneficiary Non-MSP overpayments between \$50-\$999.99 to
the Regional Office for Write-Off.

Submit this information, including the status of probate, if applicable,
with an explanation for the

beneficiary Non-MSP overpayment Write-off.

The regional office will be responsible for approval or denial of all
recommendations for "write-off", based on the information submitted by
Carrier.

**NOTE:** The write off of a Non-MSP beneficiary debt between
\$50-\$999.99 occurs regardless of the classification of the debt for
financial reporting. Thus, a request to write off Non-MSP beneficiary
debt between \$50-\$999.99 should occur even if the debt has been
reclassified to Currently Not Collectible (CNC).

**NOTE:** Beneficiary overpayments that are greater than \$1000 may be
recommended for write-off following the above instructions if the
Medicare contractor has verified from SSA that the beneficiary is not in
a current pay status.

**110.3 - When to Suspend Efforts to Recover From the Beneficiary
Following the Initial Demand Letter**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

Efforts to recover from the beneficiary should be suspended if any of
the following conditions exist:

**A. The Beneficiary Requests Administrative Appeal, or Questions the
Overpayment Decision**

The FI or carrier shall make no further recovery efforts until it
disposes of the appeal request. (See §110.9.)

**B. The Beneficiary Requests That Recovery be Waived or States
Conditions that Might Qualify the Beneficiary for Waiver of Recovery**

**C. The Beneficiary Is Receiving Welfare Benefits**

If the beneficiary is receiving welfare benefits, i.e., cash benefits or
Medicaid, the FI or carrier shall ascertain whether the welfare agency
will reimburse Medicare for all, or part of, the overpayment. (See
§110.1.) If the welfare agency does not refund the overpayment in full,
the FI or carrier shall not attempt recovery from the beneficiary,
unless it is apparent that the beneficiary knew or should have known
that the payment was incorrect.

**NOTE:** If a beneficiary requests an appeal or a waiver after the
overpayment has been referred to the SSA for collection from Title II
benefits, the SSA processing center will return the overpayment to the
Medicare contractor to review the waiver and/or appeal.

**110.4 - Content of Demand Letter to Beneficiary (Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

Any correspondence with a beneficiary concerning an overpayment must
contain a clear and complete explanation of the overpayment. An
overpayment which is not clearly explained is less likely to be
refunded. Furthermore, lack of clarity may deprive the individual of
sufficient information to decide

whether there is a basis for questioning the carrier\'s determination.
Clarity is also important because the letter may eventually be used by
CMS for further recovery attempts.

The following is the minimum information which shall be included in all
overpayment refund letters sent to a beneficiary:

A. Name and address of physician, date and type of service, charges,
date of check, amount of check, and name of payee.

B. A clear explanation of why the payment was not correct.

C. The amount of the overpayment and how it was calculated.

D. The beneficiary is required to refund the overpayment.

E. The refund should be by check or money order, and how it should be
made out (enclose a pre-addressed envelope).

F. The refund can be made by installments. (See §110.8.)

G. Unless a refund is made, the overpayment may be withheld from other
Medicare benefits payable to the beneficiary, and may be referred to the
Social Security Administration for further recovery action.

H. Possible recovery from other insurance (if applicable).

I. An explanation of the beneficiary\'s right to a review or hearing as
appropriate.

J. An explanation of the CMS/SSA waiver of recovery provisions. (See
§170.3.)

**110.5 - Sample Demand Letter to Beneficiary**

**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

**The FI or carrier may use or adapt the following model letter for
requesting refunds of overpayments from beneficiaries:**

\"Dear Mr. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_:

**A. Opening Paragraph:**

\"In (month and year) we paid (provider\'s, physician's, supplier's name
and location) (you)\
\$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ more than was due for services furnished by
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (from
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ through \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) (on
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_). We have reviewed the payment and determined that
it was incorrect. The correct payment should have been
\$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.\"

The FI or carrier shall include a clear and complete explanation of how
the overpayment arose and how it was calculated.)

It shall add if applicable: \"We have recovered
\$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ from (specify source). Thus, the
total remaining overpayment is \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

**B. Liability of Beneficiary When Payment Made to Physician or
Supplier**

If payment was made to the physician, add the following:

\"Under the Medicare law, you are responsible for overpayments made on
your behalf if the provider of services was not at fault in causing the
overpayment. In this case, (provider\'s, physician's, supplier's name)
was not at fault. Therefore, you are liable for the
\$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ incorrectly paid for the services you
received.\"

**C. Request for Refund**

\"Please send us a check or money order for \$
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, within 30 days. Make the check or
money order payable to (FI or carrier name), and mail it in the enclosed
self-addressed envelope."

**D. Possible Offset**

"If other Medicare benefits become payable to you and you have not
refunded the incorrect payment we will withhold the amount you owe from
those benefits." (In the initial letter the FI or carrier shall add:
"beginning 60 days from the date of this letter.")

**E. Possible Referral to Social Security Administration**

If the overpayment is over \$1000, add the following:

"If you do not repay this amount, this overpayment may be referred to
the Social Security\
Administration (or Railroad Retirement Board) for further recovery
action that, among other actions, may result in the overpayment being
deducted from any monthly social security (or railroad retirement)
benefits to which you may be entitled."

**F. Installment Payments**

\"If you are unable to refund this amount in one payment, you may make
regular installments. To refund in installments, you are required to pay
a minimum of \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_each month for \_\_\_ months.
However, we urge you to pay more each month so that this matter can be
settled as soon as possible. If you prefer to repay this overpayment
through installments, please notify us promptly how much you are able to
pay and how often.\"

**G. Possible Recovery from Other Insurance**

(The FI or carrier shall not use this paragraph where it has determined
that the private insurer will not pay.)

\"If you carry private health insurance to supplement your Medicare
benefits, you may be able to recover the amount of this overpayment by
claiming benefits from the other plan, or (name of provider or
physician) may be able to submit such a claim on your behalf. If you
plan to file a claim with a supplemental plan and use the proceeds to
refund this overpayment, please let us know. If you need help in filing
such a claim, please contact any Social Security office.\"

**H. Notification of Appeal Rights**

The notification of appeal rights must be in accordance with the
reopening rules in Medicare Claims Processing, Chapter 29 -- Appeals of
Claims Decisions.

**NOTE:** If the overpayment was for medically unnecessary services or
for custodial care, The FI or carrier shall begin the first sentence of
the appeals paragraph:

\"If you believe that this determination is not correct, or if you did
not know that Medicare does not pay for these services.\"

**I, Notification of Waiver of Recovery Provision**

\"The law requires that you must repay an overpayment of Medicare
benefits unless you meet both of the following conditions:

• You were without fault in causing the overpayment in that the
information you furnished in connection with the claim was correct and
complete to the best of your knowledge, and you had a reasonable basis
for believing that the payment was correct, and

• Paying back the overpayment would keep you from meeting your ordinary
and necessary living expenses or would be unfair.

If you claim that repayment will cause you serious financial hardship,
it will be necessary to submit a statement to the Social Security
Administration regarding your income, assets, and expenses.

If you believe that both conditions for waiver of this overpayment apply
in your case, please let us know, giving a brief statement of your
reasons. You may contact your Social Security office. You will

be notified if recovery of this overpayment is waived. If waiver cannot
be granted, you will have the opportunity to present your case at a
personal conference. The conference will be conducted by an employee of
the Social Security Administration who did not participate in the
initial waiver determination.\"

**110.6 - Optional Paragraphs for Inclusion in Demand Letters (Rev. 29,
01-02-04)**

The FI or carrier should use or adapt the following paragraphs in
explaining how the overpayment occurred.

**A. Inpatient Hospital Deductible or Coinsurance Not Properly
Assessed - FI**

**1. General - FI**

"Medicare pays all costs of covered services furnished during the first
60 days of hospitalization except for the first \$\_\_\_\_\_ (the
inpatient deductible). For the 61st through the 90th days Medicare pays
all costs except for a coinsurance of \$\_\_\_\_\_ per day. After 90
days of benefits have been used, an additional 60 lifetime reserve days
are available. There is \$\_\_\_\_\_ per day coinsurance for each
lifetime reserve day used.

**2. Deductible Overpayment**

"Our records show that the claim for the inpatient services you received
at (provider\'s name) was improperly processed. Benefits were mistakenly
paid for \_\_\_\_ days in full. However, since these were the first
inpatient hospital services furnished in this benefit period you are
responsible for the deductible and the \$\_\_\_\_\_ inpatient hospital
deductible should have been subtracted from the reimbursement paid
(provider\'s name) on your behalf. Thus (provider\'s name) was overpaid
by \$\_\_\_\_\_\_."

**3. Coinsurance Overpayment**

"Our records show that the claim for the inpatient services you received
at (provider\'s name and address) was improperly processed. Benefits
were mistakenly paid for \_\_\_\_ full days (less the \$\_\_\_\_
deductible). However, since you had previously been hospitalized for
\_\_\_\_ days at (name of provider where previously hospitalized) during
that benefit period, your claim should have been processed as \_\_\_
full days and \_\_\_\_ coinsurance days (and/or lifetime reserve days).
Therefore (provider\'s name) has been overpaid on your behalf for
\_\_\_\_\_ coinsurance days at \$\_\_\_\_\_ per day and/or lifetime
reserve days at \$\_\_\_\_\_\_ per day) (less \$\_\_\_\_\_ for the
inpatient hospital deductible which was improperly applied to your
claim). The total overpayment is \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."

**B. Deductible Not Properly Assessed -Carrier**

"Under Part B of Medicare, no reimbursement may be made for the first
\$100 of approved charges incurred by a beneficiary in each calendar
year." (If pertinent, add: "This is true even if you were covered under
Medicare for only part of the year.") In these cases explain the
computation of the overpayment.

**C. Payment Made Under Workers' Compensation Law**

We paid \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in benefits for services furnished
you by (provider\'s, physician's or supplier's name and location) on
(dates). However, these payments were in error since these services were
covered under the (State) workers\' compensation law and Medicare may
not pay for services that are covered under workers\' compensation.
Since (provider\'s, physician's, supplier's name) was not at fault in
causing this overpayment, you are required to refund the
\$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Medicare paid on your behalf. You may
wish to submit the bill for these services to your employer or his
workers\'\
compensation carrier for payment under the State workers\' compensation
provisions."

**D. Beneficiary Not Entitled to Medicare Benefits**

\"The Social Security Administration\'s records show that you were not
entitled to (specify Part A hospital insurance and/or Part B medical
insurance) benefits when these services (item(s)) were furnished. Your
Medicare Handbook explains the difference between Part A (hospital) and
Part B (medical) insurance. The decision that you were not entitled to
these benefits was made by the Social Security Administration, and not
by (FI or carrier name). Therefore, if you disagree with this decision,
or if you have any questions about your entitlement to Medicare
benefits, contact your Social Security office. If you go to the Social
Security office, take this letter with you."

**110.7 - Recovery Where Beneficiary Is Deceased (Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

Where a beneficiary who is liable for an overpayment dies, the FI or
carrier shall attempt to recover from such sources as State welfare
agencies, or private insurance plans (see §110.1), or withhold the
overpayment from any underpayments due the beneficiary\'s estate or due
a surviving relative. (See 42 CFR 424.60)

If the entire overpayment cannot be recovered by the above methods, it
shall send a letter (see sample below) addressed to the estate of the
deceased at the address of the legal representative if known, or to the
last known address of the deceased. It shall include the basic
information in §110.5, but shall not mention the possibility of
installment payments or the possibility of offset against monthly
benefits.

The FI or carrier shall not direct recovery efforts against a person who
answered a recovery letter concerning an overpayment unless it is known
that the individual represents the beneficiary\'s estate. It shall not
recover by offset against underpayments payable to a provider of
services or to a person (other than the beneficiary\'s estate) who paid
the bill.

Model Refund Request to Estate of Deceased Beneficiary (FI or carrier
shall adapt to Fit the Situation)

Estate of (deceased beneficiary) (or, if known, \"Representative of the
Estate of (deceased beneficiary)).

Dear Sir (or Dear M. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ if estate representative\'s
name is known).

On (date) we paid (provider\'s, physician's, or supplier's name and
location)(deceased beneficiary, if applicable) \$ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ more
than was due for services furnished by (\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) on \_\_\_\_\_
(from \_\_\_\_\_\_ through \_\_\_\_\_).\"

(This paragraph should include a clear and complete explanation of how
the overpayment

arose, the amount of the overpayment, how it was calculated, and why the
payment was not correct.)

The FI or carrier shall add if applicable:

\"We have recovered \$ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ from (specify source). Thus,
the total remaining overpayment is \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

"If other Medicare benefits become payable to the estate and you have
not refunded the incorrect payment, we will withhold the amount owed
from those benefits.

If payment was made to the physician, add the following:

Under the Medicare law, the beneficiary is responsible for overpayments
made on his behalf if the (provider, physician) was not at fault in
causing the overpayment. In this case ((provider, physician) name) was
not at fault. Therefore, the estate of (deceased beneficiary) is liable
for the \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ incorrectly paid to ((provider, physician)
name) for the services it furnished (deceased beneficiary).

"Please send us a check or money order in the amount of \$
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ payable to (FI or carrier name) in the enclosed,
self-addressed envelope within 30 days.

**NOTE:** The FI or carrier shall undertake notification of appeal
rights in accordance with the reopening rules in Medicare Claims
Processing, Chapter 29, Appeals of Claims Decisions.

"If you believe that (deceased beneficiary) was without fault in causing
this overpayment and that recovery of the overpayment would be unfair,
you may request that recovery of the overpayment be waived. Your request
should include a brief statement of your reasons for requesting
waiver.\"

**110.8 - Beneficiary Wishes to Refund in Installments**\
**(Rev. 315, Issued: 05-17-19, Effective: 06-18- 19, Implementation:
06-18-19)**

The term Medicare beneficiary identifier (Mbi) is a general term
describing a beneficiary's Medicare identification number. For purposes
of this manual, Medicare beneficiary identifier references both the
Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) and the Medicare Beneficiary
Identifier (MBI) during the new Medicare card transition period and
after for certain business areas that will continue to use the HICN as
part of their processes.

**A. General**

If an overpaid beneficiary states that they are unable to refund the
full amount of an overpayment at one time, regular monthly installment
payments are acceptable. The amount and frequency of the installments
should be in reasonable relationship to the amount of the overpayment.

Normally, the installments should be large enough to effect recovery
within 3 years; however, the FI or carrier shall allow a longer
installment period if the beneficiary is willing to refund at least \$50
per month. In notifying a beneficiary that they can refund an
overpayment by installments, the FI or carrier shall specify the amount
(not less than \$10) and the number of monthly installments necessary to
recovery the overpayment.

**NOTE:** These provisions for repayment in installments do not apply to
overpayments for which providers are liable.

The FI or carrier shall exercise care in distinguishing between a
request for repayment in installments, and a request for waiver. Where a
beneficiary states that they cannot afford an installment of at least
\$10 per month, or that they can afford installments of \$10 to \$50 per
month but the overpayment is so large that recovery would take
substantially more than 3 years, the FI or carrier shall treat such
statement as a request for waiver. (See §110.9)

**B. Notification of Installment Schedule**

When agreement is reached with a beneficiary for refund by installments,
the FI or carrier shall notify the beneficiary of the installment
schedule. Request the beneficiary to sign an installment agreement such
as the one in paragraph C below. It shall give one copy of the agreement
to the beneficiary, and retain the other.

**C. Suggested Installment Agreement**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Name of Overpaid
Beneficiary Beneficiary\'s Address

> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\
> Medicare beneficiary identifier

I hereby agree to repay my Medicare overpayment totaling \$
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to (FI or carrier name), which will receive the
payments on behalf of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. My
payments will be made as follows:

> **DATE PAYMENT DUE (Month, Day, Year)**\
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Signature of
Beneficiary

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\
**Date**

> Amount of Payment
>
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**D. Beneficiary Fails to Remit Installments**

If the beneficiary fails to remit two consecutive installments, or after
remitting the overdue installments, fails to remit any subsequent
installments, the FI or carrier shall ask the beneficiary the reason for
the lapse. If it does not receive a response within 30 days, or is
informed that the beneficiary is unable to continue paying any
installments the statement should be treated as a waiver request. If the
FI or carrier learns that the beneficiary is deceased, see
[§110.]{.underline}7.

**E. Beneficiary Can No Longer Afford Installment Amount But Can Afford
a Lesser Amount**

If the beneficiary notifies the FI or carrier that they can no longer
afford to pay the agreed-upon installments but can afford a lesser
amount, the FI or carrier shall set up a new agreement, provided the new
installment is at least \$10 per month, and large enough to effect
recovery of the remainder of the overpayment within approximately 3
years after the date of the new installment agreement.

**110.9 - Beneficiary Protests**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

A beneficiary\'s reply to a notification of overpayment or request for
refund may constitute a request for waiver, or request for appeal, i.e.,
reconsideration, review, carrier fair hearing, or ALJ hearing as
applicable, or a request for both waiver and appeal.

**A. Protests To Treat As Requests Administrative Appeal**

The FI or carrier shall consider a beneficiary\'s reply a request for
administrative appeal (Part A reconsideration, Part B review, Part B
fair hearing, or ALJ hearing (both A & B), as applicable) if the
beneficiary protests the existence of an overpayment, the amount of the
overpayment, or if the nature of the protest is unclear. (See B below
for which protests the FI or carrier shall consider requests for
waiver.) It shall take no further recovery action in such cases until
the administrative appeal process is completed. (See Pub. 100-4,
Medicare Claims Processing, Chapter 29, Appeals of Claims Decisions.)

The FI or carrier shall tell the beneficiary that the request is being
considered (or has been forwarded to the Office of Hearings and Appeals,
if a hearing request) and that no action is necessary until further
notice. If the overpayment case has been referred to SSA, the FI or
carrier shall inform SSA of the appeal so that recovery action by SSA
may be suspended pending the results of the appeal.

If the appeal determination is that the beneficiary is liable for an
overpayment, the FI or carrier shall send the beneficiary another
request for refund of the overpayment (including all information in
[§110.5]{.underline}), unless the beneficiary has also requested waiver.
In that event, see B below.

**B. Protests To Treat As Requests for Waiver**

If an overpaid beneficiary protests on the grounds of hardship, or that
recovery would be inequitable, the FI or carrier shall treat the protest
as a request for waiver even if it is filed on a form ordinarily used
for requesting administrative appeal. Discontinue collection efforts and
make a waiver determination if necessary. If the beneficiary offers
evidence of financial condition, the FI or carrier shall include it, but
shall not solicit such evidence. It shall tell the beneficiary that the
overpayment case will be forwarded to the Social Security Administration
and that no action is necessary until further notice.

**NOTE:** If the beneficiary has also requested appeal, the FI or
carrier shall conduct the appeal prior to the waiver determination.

**110.10 - When the FI or Carrier Does Not Take Recovery Action in**\
**Beneficiary Cases but Considers Whether Waiver of Recovery is
Applicable (Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

The FI or carrier shall consider whether waiver of recovery from the
beneficiary is applicable. If the beneficiary is liable and the criteria
for waiver of recovery from the beneficiary are likely to be met, i.e.,
it appears from the circumstances that the beneficiary was without fault
and that recovery is against equity and good conscience or defeats the
purpose of the Medicare program (i.e., would cause the individual
financial hardship), the FI or carrier makes a waiver determination.

The FI or carrier shall first determine if the beneficiary was without
fault see §70.3. If it appears that the beneficiary was without fault
the FI or carrier shall then determine if recovery would be against
equity and good conscience or if recovery would defeat the purpose of
title II or title XVIII of the Social Security Act.

> •For recovery to be against equity and good conscience an individual
> must have changed his or her position for the worse or relinquished a
> valuable right because of reliance upon a notice that a payment would
> be made or because of the overpayment itself. (See 20 CFR §404.509)
>
> •For recovery to defeat the purpose of title II or title XVIII of the
> Social Security Act the beneficiary must need all of his or her
> current income to meet ordinary and necessary living expenses. (See 20
> CFR §405.508)

The FI or carrier shall make waiver of recovery determinations for
individual Non-MSP overpayments up to \$20,000. If an individual Non-MSP
overpayment is greater than \$20,000, and the FI or carrier believes
that the waiver of recovery is appropriate the FI or carrier shall make
a recommendation to the regional office for approval to waive the
recovery. If there is a situation that involves several\
beneficiaries where the aggregate total of all waiver determinations
exceeds \$40,000, the regional office shall be notified. The regional
office shall provide guidance as to who shall approve the waiver of
recovery determinations.

If the FI or carrier decides that the information available does not
justify waiver, it proceeds with normal recovery efforts from the
beneficiary.

**NOTE:** If a beneficiary requests an appeal or a waiver after the
overpayment has been referred to the SSA for collection from Title II
benefits, the SSA processing center will return the overpayment to the
Medicare contractor to review the waiver and/or appeal.

**110.11 -- Recording Overpayment Cases in Which the Provider is Not
Liable---FI Only**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

If a provider is relieved of liability for refunding an overpayment, and
an adjustment bill is required in accordance with Medicare Bill
Processing, Chapter 1, General Billing Requirements, the FI shall treat
the charges involved in the year-end cost report as though they were
covered; i.e., make provision to assure that the overpaid amount is not
recovered from the provider at the time of final cost settlement.

If the FI has a system capable of preventing year-end recovery from the
provider, where it was relieved of liability for refunding an
overpayment, it need not maintain an additional record of the case.

**120 - Referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) (Rev. 29,
01-02-04)**

If the FI/Carrier's attempts to recover an overpayment are unsuccessful
and the FI/Carrier believes that the overpayment may be recovered
through litigation the FI/Carrier should informally refer the
overpayment to the RO to explore the possibility of litigation. If the
RO, in conjunction with the Office of General Counsel, believes
litigation is necessary it will request the FI/Carrier to prepare the
case file for referral to the DOJ. The RO will inform the FI/Carrier of
all elements to include in the case file.

**A. General**

The DOJ requires the submittal of a Claims Collection Litigation Report
(CCLR) for overpayment litigation of claims. The CCLR is a checklist of
all administrative collection actions. If need be the RO can assist the
FI/Carrier in obtaining a copy of the CCLR. The FI/Carrier will follow
the advice received by their RO's OGC in completing the CCLR.

In addition to completing the sections of the CCLR as much as possible
the FI/Carrier must provide any relevant information to help DOJ. If
applicable, the FI/Carrier must notify DOJ if there has been a change of
ownership, if there have been any bankruptcy proceedings, and all
necessary information concerning the identification of any outstanding
overpayments regardless of the determination date. The following
guidelines exist for providing information relevant to the
identification of overpayments. However, the RO may request additional
documents if they are relevant to the overpayment and/or provider.

[Identification of Overpayment(s)]{.underline}

The FI/Carrier shall clearly identify the overpayment(s). Cost report
overpayments should be identified for each cost reporting period, by
total overpayment amount and each individual overpayment amount if
multiple overpayments have occurred (tentative and final settlements,
interim rate adjustments...). It shall show any partial payments made by
the debtor and clearly distinguish between principal and interest. It
shall include documentation to support the overpayment determination.
This includes copies of the cost reports, audits, and reviews, copies of
all correspondence, and any other information relevant to the
overpayment.

[Refund Requests]{.underline}

The FI/Carrier shall include a copy of the demand letter(s) to the
provider. Where demand letters were returned by the postal service, the
FI/Carrier shall document other attempts to secure the address of the
debtor(s).

[Recovery Efforts]{.underline}

The following are required:

> • The FI/Carrier's internal communications relative to recovery
> efforts;

• Detailed reports of all conferences the FI/Carrier held with the
provider relative to the overpayment; and

• A detailed narrative of the current situation with the FI/Carrier's
evaluation of the cause of the incorrect payment, including setoff
against any payments that may have been due the provider.

[Provider\'s Ability to Refund]{.underline}

The FI/Carrier shall include its evaluation of the provider\'s ability
to pay. It shall include, if possible, an examination of a statement
showing assets and liabilities and other relevant financial documents.
It shall include:

> • Corporate financial statement;
>
> • Statement by the debtor showing assets and liabilities;
>
> • Income and expenses (signed by the debtor under penalty of perjury);

• Any other financial data necessary including the age and health of the
debtor, potential future income, and the possibility that the debtor
concealed or improperly transferred assets.

**120.1 - Communication on Cases Sent to RO for DOJ Referral (Rev. 29,
01-02-04)**

If the FI/Carrier receives any funds, bills for current services, cost
report (where one had not been filed), compromise offers, etc., after
sending the case for referral to DOJ, it shall notify the RO. It will be
advised by the RO as to how to respond to the provider\'s actions.

When a case is referred to the DOJ, the RO notifies the FI/Carrier, who
will take no further collection actions except for withheld amounts that
may become available. The FI/Carrier shall forward any communications
received from the provider to the RO.

**120.2 - Cases Referred to DOJ for Possible Litigation (Rev. 29,
01-02-04)**

After a provider overpayment case has been referred to DOJ, the
FI/Carrier shall not contact or negotiate with the provider, unless
authorized to do so by the DOJ or the U.S. Attorney handling the case.
Submit all requests for negotiation to the RO.

To avoid extensive legal proceedings and costs by both parties,
compromise offers may be made by the provider or the DOJ. If the DOJ
contacts the RO with such a request, the RO forwards the information to
the FI/Carrier for provider notification. If the provider offers a
compromise, the FI/Carrier shall notify the RO and submit the following
information:

• Relevant documentation relating to the offer to compromise including,
but not limited to, the name, title, and position of the party making
the offer, the amount of the compromise offer to settle or otherwise
dispose of the overpayment, and the financial standing of the debtors;
and

> • Recommendations of the U. S. Attorney, if any.

The FI/Carrier shall forward the offer of compromise to the CMS Claims
Collection Officer (CCO) through the RO.

In most cases, the U.S. Attorney assigned the Medicare overpayment case
will not be fully familiar with Medicare procedures, laws, regulations,
or reimbursement. The FI/Carrier may be requested to provide technical
information to supplement the U. S. Attorney\'s knowledge. As cases are
readied for litigation,

the RO may contact the FI/Carrier for assistance in documenting the
administrative record, e.g., a list of FI potential witnesses and
technical advisors.

**130 -- Change of Ownership (CHOW)**

**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

When a provider undergoes a CHOW, the provider agreement is
automatically assigned to the new owner unless the new owner rejects
assignment of the provider agreement. The paragraphs below describe the
impact of assignment on overpayment recovery.

[Assignment of Medicare Provider Agreement:]{.underline}

Automatic assignment of the existing provider agreement to the new owner
means the new owner is subject to all the terms and conditions under
which the existing agreement was issued. (See State Operations Manual,
§3210) With assignment, the new owner assumes all penalties and
sanctions under the Medicare program, including the repayment of any
accrued overpayments, regardless of who had ownership of the Medicare
agreement at the time the overpayment was discovered unless fraud was
involved. In addition, the new owner receives benefits of assuming the
Medicare provider agreement, such as receiving underpayments discovered
after the CHOW.

When a provider undergoes a CHOW where the new provider accepts
assignment of the previous owner's Medicare agreement, the
responsibility for repaying any outstanding and future overpayments
resides with the new owner. Exception: If any of the overpayments
determined for a fiscal year when the previous owner had assignment were
discovered due to fraud the responsibility for the repayment of the
overpayments does not shift to the new provider. It stays with the old
provider.

A sales agreement stipulating that the new owner is not liable for the
overpayments made to the previous owner is not evidence enough for
recovery from the new owner to not occur. Medicare was not a part of the
sales agreement. That is a civil matter and it would be up to the new
owner to enforce the sales agreement. If the new owner assumes
assignment of the Medicare agreement, Medicare will attempt to recover
from the new/current owner regardless of the sales agreement.

The intermediary should attempt collection from the new owner. If this
is not successful and the FI/Carrier has reasonable evidence that the
previous owner can repay the overpayment it should refer the case to the
regional office. The regional office will then confer with the regional
OGC and decide if this case warrants collection from the previous owner.
This should be completed before the debt is transferred to the
Department of Treasury.

[Nonassignment of a Medicare provider agreement]{.underline}:

If the new owner refuses to accept assignment of the Medicare agreement,
the new owner must enter into its own Medicare agreement. In this case
there would be no CHOW of the Medicare agreement and the previous owner
would still be responsible for any outstanding overpayments.

**140 - Bankruptcy**\
**(Rev. 227, Issued: 09 17-13, Effective: 10-04-13, Implementation:
10-04-13)**

This section contains actions that the contractors must take to
safeguard the Medicare Trust Funds when a provider files for bankruptcy.
This section does not address bankruptcy issues involving debts arising
under the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) provisions. (Although this
chapter will usually use the term \"provider,\" its provisions also
apply to suppliers, including physicians). However, use of the term
\"provider\" does not mean that the Medicare program considers suppliers
and physicians to be providers. It also explains how to report
accurately the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\' (CMS) accounts
receivable balances and support CMS\'s efforts to effectively evaluate
and manage bankruptcy cases.

This chapter will guide contractor staff through the initial stages of a
provider bankruptcy. It is not intended to be, and cannot be, a step by
step process from beginning to end. Bankruptcy is litigation. Bankruptcy
law and the bankruptcy court affect all the actions CMS and its
contractors take concerning a bankrupt Medicare provider. Therefore,
contractor staff shall consult closely with the Regional Office (RO)
before taking, omitting, continuing or discontinuing actions regarding a
bankrupt provider. In some cases, attorneys from the Department of
Justice (DOJ) in Washington, D.C. or United States Attorney\'s offices
will work directly with RO staff. However, in most cases, the RO will be
in contact with regional counsel.

**140.1 - Bankruptcy Forms**

> **(Rev.11124 Issued:11-18-21 , Effective: 12-21-21,
> Implementation:12-21-21 )**
>
> Upon receipt of a new bankruptcy notice, contractors shall immediately
> notify the appropriate CMS Regional Office (RO) of the bankruptcy and
> begin the process of collecting the required information on the
> Bankruptcy Referral Checklist. The\
> Bankruptcy Referral Checklist is divided into three tiers, each
> designed to gather the appropriate bankruptcy information within a
> reasonable timeframe. Tier I information is being updated to clarify
> the Debts Recalled from Treasury N/A option. Tier II\
> information is being updated to include clarification on the Fraud
> check and including HIGLAS Customer Level screen to be submitted to
> the RO within ten business days of receipt of the bankruptcy
> notification. The submission time frames for Tier II are extended by 5
> business days, to account for the Fraud Check Request.
>
> **Tier I**
>
> **Debts Recalled from Treasury (Y/N or N/A)?**
>
> If debt(s) have been recalled from Treasury due to the bankruptcy case
> list Y. If debt(s) are currently at Treasury list N. If debt(s) are
> currently not referred to Treasury list N/A.
>
> **Tier II**
>
> **Fraud Check Report Request Instructions**
>
> 1.The contractor shall email its fraud check request spreadsheet along
> with a completed CPI data request form (Attachment #1) to with the
>
> subject line "Contractor/Jurisdiction Fraud Check Request" (example --
> ABC/J2 Fraud Check
>
> Request).
>
> 2.The contractor should expect to receive the fraud check report from
> CPI within one week of sending the fraud check request to CPI. The
> contractor shall use the fraud check report to determine if the
> provider/supplier has an open fraud case. Please see Attachment #2 for
> a sample UCM fraud check report and note the following:
>
> **•** The NPI is listed in column A (PRVDR_NPI_NUM).
>
> **•**Column B (UCM_FRAUD_CHECK) will indicate a "Y" if the NPI was
> found in UCM. An "N" in column B will indicate that there are no
> records listed for the NPI. Therefore, all other fields will be blank.
>
> **•** If there is a "Y" in column B, proceed to column P
> (RFRL_OPEN_IND) to determine
>
> if the case is open or closed. If there is a "Y", the case is open. An
> "N" indicates that
>
> the provider's fraud case is closed.
>
> **•**If there are more than one open and/or closed fraud cases for a
> given provider/supplier, filter column P with the "Ys" only to get
> those with open fraud cases. If all entries for a
>
> given NPI have an "N" in columns B or P, then the provider/suppler has
> no open fraud
>
> cases. However, if one or more of a given provider/supplier NPI's
> entries has a "Y" in
>
> column P, the provider/supplier has an open fraud case.
>
> The contractor shall include a copy of the fraud check report for the
> NPIs that are included on the Bankruptcy on the checklist spreadsheet
> Tier II that is sent to the RO.

\*Note: The CPI Fraud check applies to bankrupt providers/suppliers with
NPI's. Bankrupt providers/suppliers with no NPI's should follow the
current process of checking for fraud.

> **HIGLAS Customer Status Instructions**
>
> 1.Upon receipt of instructions from the RO to place a
> provider/supplier in bankruptcy status, the contractor shall update
> the provider/suppler to BNK status at the Customer level in HIGLAS and
> the Part A Provider Audit STAR system, Provider Profile, "if
> applicable".
>
> 2.The contractor shall submit a screen print of the HIGLAS Customer
> Status History showing the BNK code in the Customer Status.
>
> 3.Upon receipt of instructions from the RO to remove a
> provider/supplier from\
> bankruptcy status, the contractor shall update the provider/suppler to
> INIT status at the Customer level in HIGLAS and the Part A Provider
> Audit STAR system, Provider Profile, "if applicable".
>
> 4.The contractor shall submit a screen print of the HIGLAS Customer
> Status History showing the INIT code in the Customer Status.

**140.2 - Basic Bankruptcy Terms and Definitions (Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

**140.2.1 - Bankruptcy is Litigation**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

An individual or company declares bankruptcy by filing a petition for
bankruptcy in a United States Bankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Court
then opens a bankruptcy case. The Bankruptcy Court closely monitors the
affairs of the individual or company (the debtor) including the
creditors\' treatment of the debtor. Bankruptcy may appear to be
\"business as usual\" for a debtor, but it is not. You should not take
any action for or against a debtor until you consult the Regional Office
who will consult with the Regional attorney handling the bankruptcy. Do
not share any information about bankruptcy strategy or activities with
the bankrupt provider.

**140.2.2 - Types of Bankruptcies**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) identifies four
types of bankruptcies that may involve Medicare providers: Chapter 7, 9,
11 and 13. We briefly describe each type here to familiarize you with
these types of bankruptcy. However, these general descriptions do not
replace your attorney\'s specific advice in a particular bankruptcy
case.

1\. Chapter 7 - Debtors file Chapter 7 bankruptcies to obtain discharge
of their debts. Companies that file under Chapter 7 generally close. A
court-appointed trustee accumulates the assets of the debtor, sells
them, and distributes the money among those whom the debtor owes (the
creditors).

2\. Chapter 9 - Chapter 9 bankruptcies involve municipalities such as a
hospital district. Chapter 9 provides for reorganization, much like
Chapter 11.

3\. Chapter 11 - Debtors file Chapter 11 to reorganize the debtor
individual or business. To emerge from Chapter 11, the debtor in
possession submits a Plan of Reorganization (\"Plan\"). The Plan
indicates the amount and schedule for payments to creditors. Creditors
vote on the Plan, and the Court must confirm it. Recovery amounts vary.
The Bankruptcy Code provides for discharge of the remainder of the debt.

4\. Chapter 13 - Chapter 13 bankruptcies adjust the debts of individuals
(including sole proprietorships) with a regular income. Generally,
debtors must file a debt adjustment plan within 15 days after filing.

**140.2.3 - Filing Bankruptcy Draws a Line in the Sand**\
**(Rev. 222, Issued: 06-14-13, Effective: 07-17-13, Implementation:
07-17-13)**

The petition date (i.e., the date the debtor files its petition in
bankruptcy with the Bankruptcy Court) draws a line in the sand between
prepetition and postpetition actions. Events that occur before the
petition date are prepetition. Events that occur on or after the
petition date are postpetition. The automatic stay governs many actions
that contractors may take concerning a debtor postpetition. Contractors
shall therefore consult with the RO before taking action concerning the
debtor postpetition.

Medicare\'s right to recover overpayments can depend on whether they are
prepetition or postpetition. The RO shall direct contractors on how to
treat payments for prepetition services (prepetition payments) and
payments for postpetition services (postpetition payments) to maximize
Medicare\'s recovery.

**140.2.4 Bankruptcy Affects Nearly All Medicare Operations (Rev. 12,
10-18-02)**

Bankruptcy can affect every aspect of the interaction between the
Medicare program and a debtor. Each contractor staff member who may come
in contact with a debtor, is effectively a part of the Medicare
\"bankruptcy team\" for that case. You, as contractor point of contact,
must ensure that all potential bankruptcy team members alert you if they
anticipate actions concerning the debtor, and that they then coordinate
those actions with you and with the RO and Regional Counsel. In
bankruptcy, both inaction and inappropriate action hurt Medicare\'s
chances of recovery. Some commonly affected areas are:

**1. Overpayment Recovery**

Medicare\'s right to recover prepetition and postpetition overpayments
also varies by federal jurisdiction. (See discussion on set-off and
recoupment in section F below). If you have overpaid a debtor, you must
consult the RO, then take appropriate action to maximize recovery of
Medicare overpayments from debtors. Contractor overpayment staff should
not send any letters to the debtor until the RO approves them for
release.

**2. Fraud and Abuse**

Ensure that you consult with CMS Program Integrity staff and the RO
before you suspend an entity for fraud and/or abuse, recover fraud
overpayments, or continue suspensions. If you have evidence that the
provider filed for bankruptcy because of fraud it committed, advise the
RO handling the bankruptcy.

**3. Reimbursement**

Contractor reimbursement staff must notify the RO before suspending
payments to a debtor for failure to file a cost report or a credit
balance report. DO NOT issue tentative settlement payments in bankruptcy
cases unless explicitly requested by the RO.

Unless otherwise directed, contractor reimbursement staff should
continue to review and audit cost reports as usual. However, the
contractor must submit notices of program reimbursement to the RO for
review and obtain approval before issuing them.

The CMS will advise the contractor reimbursement staff about
stipulations and settlements that affect audit and/or reimbursement. In
making global settlements decisions CMS will consider the cost and
benefits of auditing cost reports in cases where recovery is unlikely
and direct contractor staff accordingly.

**4. Payment**

Contractor payment staff must receive approval from the RO before taking
any action that changes the amounts payable or owed by a debtor.

**5. Appeals**

Contractor staff will be asked about recent and current Administrative
Law Judge, Provider Reimbursement Review Board and Department Appeal
Board appeals involving a provider in bankruptcy.

**6. Changes of Ownership**

A debtor may attempt to transfer provider agreements so that both
parties may avoid overpayment recovery. DMSO staff will notify other
regional office staff when a debtor provider files for a CHOW, and
immediately notify the Regional Counsel who is handling the bankruptcy.
The CHOW will not be processed until the regional office obtains the
concurrence of the Regional Counsel who is handling the bankruptcy.

**140.2.5 - Recoupment and Set-off (see also §140.6.4) -(Rev. 12,
10-18-02)**

Recoupment and set-off are two of Medicare\'s strongest tools for
recovering overpayments to debtor providers. Jurisdictions vary in their
decisions about how Medicare can use these tools. Some jurisdictions
consider the Medicare part A provider agreement one contract
/transaction and allow it to be the basis for broad powers of
recoupment. Other jurisdictions consider each cost report year as a
distinct contract and restrict recoupment to periods within a particular
cost report year. Your RO/Regional Counsel can advise you whether
current law in a given jurisdiction permits recoupment.

**1. Recoupment**

Recoupment permits a party to reduce current payments to account for
prior overpayments made under the same contract or transaction.
Recoupment permits adjustment across the petition date and does not
require approval of the bankruptcy court. Therefore, Medicare should
recoup in any jurisdiction where it is permitted. Do not begin, continue
or discontinue recoupment without approval of the RO.

**2. Set-off**

If recoupment is not permitted, set-off will be considered. Medicare
must take quick action to recover overpayments using set-off. Set-off
should not take place without specific instructions by the RO.

Set-off permits making similar adjustments in situations involving one
or more contracts or transactions.

For example, suppose B owes A \$40.00 under one contract and A owes B
\$50.00 under another contract. If set-off is allowed then A can take
her \$40 from the \$50 she is holding for B (A would only pay B
\$10.00). Generally, parties can request court permission to set-off. If
allowed, parties can set-off prepetition claims against prepetition
payments or postpetition claims against postpetition payments. They
cannot set-off prepetition claims against postpetition claims.

**3. Administrative Freeze**

Once it is discovered that a provider is in bankruptcy, Medicare can
enact a temporary administrative freeze. An administrative freeze
(sometimes called a Strumpf freeze, named after a Supreme Court case)
will allow time for Medicare to determine if there are any overpayments
and to ask the bankruptcy court to allow set-off. Speed is essential
because courts do not permit set-off across the petition date. A
pre-petition overpayment can only be set-off against a pre-petition
claim.

**140.2.6 - Time is of the Essence -**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

Do not wait for formal notice of a bankruptcy and do not assume that
someone else has notified the appropriate party. Medicare does not
always receive timely and proper notice. By waiting, we may lose the
opportunity to recover Medicare overpayments. Notify the RO/regional
counsel immediately when you get credible information that a bankruptcy
is about to occur. Good sources to obtain early\
information about bankruptcies include the Internet; newspapers, trade
journals, and business magazines are good sources. Each individual item
listed below should be relayed to the RO as soon as you receive it:

Name and address(s) of the individual or entity,

Type and timing of Medicare reimbursement the provider receives,

Amounts and types of outstanding overpayments,

Date of pending or planned reopening,

Status of any unsettled cost report years (expected settlement date and
expected results); remember, DO NOT make tentative settlement payments
to an individual or entity in bankruptcy, and make final settlement
payments only after obtaining the RO\'s concurrence.

Dates and amounts of next Medicare payments if possible,

The name of the court and jurisdiction, case number, phone number of the
debtor\'s attorney in the matter, and

Any current changes of ownership or quality of care issues).

**140.2.7 - Definitions -**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

You may encounter the terms listed below. The definitions are provided
to give a general understanding. Specific terms may apply differently
based upon the circumstances of a particular bankruptcy case.

Adversary Proceeding is litigation in bankruptcy court to recover money
or property; determine the validity, priority or ranking of an interest
in property; get approval for selling an estate\'s property interest;
revoke a discharge or an order of confirmation; and obtain declaratory
judgments related to matters of the bankruptcy estate. Litigation
against CMS to turn over recouped monies is an example of an adversary
proceeding.

Affirmative Recovery Actions is debtor\'s assumption of its executory
contract (its provider agreement).

Automatic Stay is an injunction that automatically springs into effect
concurrent with the filing of the bankruptcy petition. The automatic
stay protects the assets of the estate from lawsuits, foreclosures,
garnishments, and any other collection activities that are not
specifically exempt from the stay by statute or specifically approved by
the bankruptcy court. The automatic stay applies to Medicare overpayment
letters that demand repayment, assess interest or otherwise attempt to
gain possession of property of the bankruptcy estate.

Bankruptcy Trustee is a private individual or corporation appointed to
represent the interests of the bankruptcy estate and the debtor\'s
creditors.

Bar Date is the deadline for filing a proof of claim. In general the bar
date for government agencies such as CMS is 180 days after the date of
the order for relief (usually, the date the provider files for
bankruptcy). In some bankruptcies, however, the court may set a
different date.

Claim is the creditor\'s right to payment or equitable relief creating a
right to payment from a debtor or the debtor\'s property whether or not
that right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured. The date a claim arises determines whether it is
prepetition or postpetition. In Medicare, the date of service is the
date of the claim.

Confirmation is bankruptcy court approval of a plan of reorganization.

Contingent Claim is a claim that may be owed by the debtor under certain
circumstances, for example, where the debtor is a co-signer on another
person\'s loan and that person has not yet defaulted, but may fail to
pay.

Creditor is a person or a business to which the debtor owes money or
which claims to be owed money by the debtor.

Debtor is a person or business who has filed a bankruptcy petition.

Discharge is a release of a debtor from liability for certain
dischargeable debts. It prevents the creditors that are owed those debts
from taking any action to collect those debts from the debtor or the
debtor\'s property. Prohibited actions include making telephone calls,
sending letters, and having contact that is intended to induce the
debtor to pay the debt.

Dischargeable Debt is a debt for which the Bankruptcy Code allows the
debtor\'s personal liability to be eliminated.

Dismiss does not release a debtor from liability on any debts. It does
not prevent creditors that are owed those debts from taking appropriate
action to collect those debts from the debtor or the debtor\'s property.
When a case is dismissed it is as if the debtor never filed. Therefore,
you may proceed with actions that include making telephone calls,
sending demand letters, and having contact that is intended to induce
the debtor to pay the debt.

Estate is the name for the Debtor\'s property interests overseen by the
bankruptcy court. Filing a petition in bankruptcy creates an estate
consisting of all legal and equitable interests the Debtor has. In
general, a legal interest is a direct ownership of property. In
contrast, an equitable interest typically is indirect and may require
court involvement to obtain control or exercise the property rights.

Executory Contract is a contract under which the parties to an agreement
have duties remaining to be performed. A Medicare Part A provider
agreement is treated as an executory contract.

Exemption is property that the Bankruptcy Code or applicable state law
permits a debtor to keep from creditors.

Fraudulent Transfer is a knowing and fraudulent transfer or concealment
of property by the debtor with intent to defeat the provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code.

Lien is a recorded claim upon specific property in order to secure
payment of a specific debt or performance of an obligation. Medicare
does not have a lien on overpayments.

Liquidation is the conversion of the debtor\'s property into cash with
the proceeds to be used for the benefit of creditors.

Liquidated Claim is a creditor\'s claim for a fixed amount of money.

Motion to Lift the Automatic Stay is a request by a creditor to allow
the creditor to take an action against a debtor or the debtor\'s
property that would otherwise be prohibited by the automatic stay.

Non-Dischargeable Debt is a debt that cannot be eliminated in
bankruptcy. Overpayments resulting from fraud are non-dischargeable. A
complaint to determine dischargeability must be filed in the bankruptcy
court. See Adversarial Proceeding, above.

Plan of Reorganization is a debtor\'s detailed description of how the
debtor proposes to pay creditors\' claims over a fixed period of time.

Priority is the Bankruptcy Code\'s statutory ranking of unsecured
claims. It determines the order in which unsecured claims will be paid
if there is not enough money to pay all unsecured claims in full.

Priority Claim is an unsecured claim that is entitled to be paid ahead
of other unsecured claims that are not entitled to priority status.
Administrative expenses for preserving the estate (e.g., certain
accounting fees or postpetition Medicare overpayments) are considered
priority claims.

Secured Debt is a debt backed by a mortgage, pledged collateral, or
other lien. The creditor that has a secured debt has the right to pursue
specific pledged property upon default. See lien above.

Schedule is a list submitted by the debtor along with the petition (or
shortly thereafter) showing the debtor\'s assets, liabilities, and other
financial information. (There are official forms a debtor must use.)

Settlement Agreement is an agreement settling a dispute between two or
more parties.

Stipulation is an agreement between parties respecting the conduct of
legal proceedings approved by the Bankruptcy Court. With appropriate
approval, Medicare may enter a stipulation agreement to facilitate a
change of ownership or to resolve an overpayment earlier than could be
expected by litigation.

United States Trustee is an officer of the Department of Justice
responsible for supervising the administration of bankruptcy cases,
estates, and trustees, monitoring plans and disclosure statements,
monitoring creditors\' committees, monitoring fee applications, and
performing other statutory duties.

Unsecured debt is one that is not backed by property or collateral.
Medicare\'s claims are generally unsecured.

**140.3 - Contractor\'s Establishment of Relationships to Ensure
Effective Actions Regarding Providers in Bankruptcy**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

**140.3.1 - Contractor Staff Must Establish Relationships to Ensure That
the RO and Regional Counsel Receive Prompt Notice of Provider
Bankruptcies, so That Medicare Can Take Quick Action**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

The contractor may receive notice of a bankruptcy from many sources
including the provider, other fiscal intermediaries or carriers, the
State, the regional office certification staff, or regional counsel. It
is imperative that contractor staff act quickly when a provider files
for bankruptcy in order to meet filing deadlines in the bankruptcy
court. Therefore, contractor staff must establish relationships to
ensure that they receive information promptly about provider
bankruptcies.

**140.3.2 - Contractors Must Recognize and Advise RO Staff About
Potential Provider Bankruptcies**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

Contractor staff must be alert to news or notices of bankruptcy and
notify RO staff immediately. Contractor staff should alert the RO to all
potential bankruptcies via a telephone call, an e-mail, or a fax.

Bankruptcy warning signs for contractors (indications that a provider is
experiencing financial difficulty, and may file for bankruptcy):

> *1.*Frequent unfiled or late-filed cost reports.
>
> *2.*Failure to make timely payments on an extended repayment plan
> schedule.
>
> *3.*Frequent changes of ownership.
>
> *4.*Litigation
>
> *5.*Voluntary or involuntary termination from the Medicare Program.
>
> *6.*Provider has difficulty meeting payroll.
>
> *7.*History of significant overpayment determinations.
>
> *8.*Significant decline in Medicare and/or total patient census.

**140.3.3 - Contractor Staff Will Establish a Relationship With the RO
That has Jurisdiction Over the Bankruptcy**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

Contractors will proactively establish and maintain ongoing
communications with the RO that has jurisdiction over a particular
bankruptcy case. This is important because bankruptcy law may differ
significantly from one jurisdiction to another, due to the structure of
the federal court system.

In the federal system, a party may appeal lower level court decisions to
a higher court, which has the power to affirm or reverse the lower
court. In order of increasing rank and authority, the federal system is
comprised of Bankruptcy Courts, District Courts, Courts of Appeals, and
the Supreme Court. Each court in this list generally hears appeals from
the court immediately preceding it. Although the Supreme Court has the
final word, it hears a highly limited number of cases each year. This
permits conflicts between lower court decisions to continue for many
years until they are resolved by the Supreme Court.

As a result, absent a Supreme Court decision, the most authoritative
precedents that may exist (and which may conflict with one another) are
issued by the Courts of Appeals. There are 11 Courts of Appeals (known
as Circuits) covering various States, plus a District of Columbia
Circuit. The decision of each Court of Appeals is controlling within the
States covered by that Circuit.

As discussed in greater detail below, CMS may want to take different
actions in a bankruptcy case for different providers, including
suspending payments, or recouping overpayments. In addition, CMS may
have taken such actions before the provider filed for bankruptcy.
Whether CMS can legally take or leave in place such actions may well
depend on where the provider filed for bankruptcy, and the existing
legal precedents within that Circuit.

For example, at the time of this writing there is conflict in the
Circuits about whether CMS may recoup prepetition overpayments from
postpetition payments without first obtaining relief from the automatic
stay. The Third Circuit (covering Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and
the Virgin Islands) forbids recoupment over different fiscal years
without such relief. By contrast, the Ninth Circuit (Alaska, Arizona,
California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Washington) and the
District of Columbia Circuit permit such recoupment. No other Court of
Appeals has decided the issue. There are various District Court
decisions going both ways.

There are also conflicting decisions by District Courts on whether CMS
may continue to suspend payments due to suspected fraud when the
provider files for bankruptcy.

For these reasons, the contractors should neither initiate nor
discontinue significant action affecting payment without first
contacting Regional Counsel.

**140.3.4 - RO Jurisdiction Generally Parallels the Bankruptcy Court
Where Case is Filed**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

In most cases, the RO which has jurisdiction over a bankruptcy case is
the one which has jurisdiction over the State in which the debtor files
for bankruptcy (bankruptcy is filed in federal court). This RO will
usually be the lead RO. The RO will contact the contractor.

The ROs will review each bankruptcy, even when no current overpayments
exist, since the possibility of overpayment determinations remains until
the FI settles all cost reports. Medicare is an unsecured creditor in
bankruptcy, and is among the last creditors to receive a distribution of
funds, unless it takes proactive steps to protect Medicare\'s interests.

**140.3.5 - Contractor and Regional Office Bankruptcy Point of Contact
Staff Member-**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

The contractors should contact their home RO to determine which RO will
have responsibility for the bankruptcy case. The RO point of contact may
be at the RO level or the Consortium level in keeping with Consortium
agreements. The RO point of contact will consolidate information and
manage, report, and coordinate ongoing communication and activities
among the appropriate involved parties (e.g., contractors, other ROs,
Chief Counsels, and Central Office) regarding bankruptcies. The RO will
communicate the name, phone number, fax and e-mail address of the point
of contact in writing or via e-mail to the Accounting Management Group,
Regional Counsel, and the affected Associate Regional Administrators for
Financial Management and respective contractors.

**140.4 - Actions to Take When a Provider Files for Bankruptcy (Rev. 12,
10-18-02)**

**140.4.1 - Establish Effective Lines of Communications With (Rev. 12,
10-18-02)**

As soon as the contractor learns that a provider has filed for
bankruptcy, it must immediately notify the following partners:

RO, Division of Financial Management Staff\
Program Integrity Staff.

Obtain the name of individual(s) whom you should contact to obtain
information quickly and to communicate information about the bankrupt
Medicare provider.

**140.4.2 - Respond to RO Requests for Information (Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

1\. For Part A bankruptcies, provide overpayment information using the
Part A Referral Checklist (see Attachment A).

Contractor staff must divide the overpayment information into
prepetition and postpetition amounts.

The contractor will report the following overpayment information to the
RO using the Referral Checklist as a reference when the contractor is
seeking technical advice:\
*a.*Provider Information:\
*1.* Provider Number\
*2.* Provider Name\
Provider Address *3.*

> *4.* Tax Identification Number (TIN)\

>
> **NOTE:**If the bankruptcy involves a provider with an audit and
> claims intermediary, (e.g., hospital with a provider-based home health
> agency or hospice), the RO will establish guidelines for
>
> obtaining information through the audit intermediary or establish
> direct communication with both intermediaries.

2\. For Part B Bankruptcies, carriers and/or DMERCs will provide
overpayment information using the Referral Checklist (see Attachment A)
as a reference when the contractor is seeking technical advice from the
RO:

Provider Information:\
*1.* Provider Number\
*2.* Provider Name\
*3.* Provider Address\
Tax Identification Number (TIN) *4.*

a.Overpayment Information:\
*1.* Claim numbers related to the overpayment\

*9.* The date of the CMS 750/751 report on which the receivable was
reported\
*10.* Overpayment Type\
*11.*\
Medical Review overpayments *12.* Fraud and Abuse overpayments or
investigations\
3. Inform the RO of any underpayments owed to providers. Ascertain
whether any prepetition or postpetition underpayments have been
determined. Do not release such funds until you have received RO
approval.

**140.4.3 - Immediate Contractor Directives From the RO (Rev. 12,
10-18-02)**

The RO will give the contractors the following guidance as soon as a
provider files for bankruptcy.

1\. The RO will notify the Contractor of Provider Bankruptcy/Litigation.

> a.Bankruptcy Filed

The RO will inform the contractor that the RO has opened a bankruptcy
case. RO will inform the contractor that it should clear any future
actions concerning the bankrupt provider(s) through the RO.

> b.Bankruptcy Filing Date.

The RO will notify the contractor of the bankruptcy filing date, since
it impacts on actions that the contractor can take and the evaluation of
whether payments are prepetition or postpetition.

> c.Immediate response to requests.

Since bankruptcy has court imposed deadlines, the contractor must take
immediate action whenever the RO or Regional Counsel makes a request.

> d.Obtain approval of all correspondence to provider.

The contractor must submit all correspondence addressed to the provider
to the RO for approval prior to release. The RO will inform Part B
Carriers/DMERCs that they should write a notification letter to replace
the system generated demand letter.

> e.Lead RO
>
> If another RO has the lead on the bankruptcy, the RO will provide the
> contractor with a contact name and telephone number. The regional
> office that supervises the contractor may need to continue to assist
> the contractor in an advisory role.

2\. The RO Will Notify Contractor of Immediate Actions It Must Take.

> a.Interim Rate Adjustment.

After consultation with regional counsel, RO will direct the
intermediary to immediately perform an interim rate adjustment to ensure
that payments are accurate and that no future overpayments occur.
(Medicare Intermediary Manual §2760.1(C.). 42 CFR §413.64(i).

> b.Recoupment.
>
> RO will inform the contractor (after discussion with regional counsel)
> whether it should continue or cease any current recovery action.
>
> c.Administrative Freeze.
>
> RO will inform the contractor (after discussion with Regional Counsel)
> whether or not it should place payments in administrative freeze.

3\. Actions The Contractor Must Take on an Ongoing Basis.

> a.Expedite Cost Report Settlement
>
> RO will tell the FI to expedite the settlement of any open cost
> reports. RO will caution the FI not to perform any tentative
> settlements unless explicitly requested by the RO (in consultation
> with
>
> Regional Counsel) and not to issue any final settlements to the
> provider without first obtaining permission from the RO (in
> consultation with Regional Counsel).
>
> b.Contractors should suspend payments if provider does not timely file
> cost report.
>
> If the bankrupt provider fails to submit a timely, acceptable cost
> report, immediately notify the RO and Regional Counsel prior to
> placing the provider in 100% withhold and immediately notify the RO
> and Regional Counsel that you have done so. When the provider submits
> an acceptable cost report consult with the RO and the Regional Counsel
> prior to release of the withheld funds.
>
> c.Part B - Tracking Overpayments and Refunds
>
> The carrier or DMERC may need to track overpayments and voluntary
> refunds for a bankrupt provider. The RO will work with Regional
> Counsel to determine what information Regional Counsel needs. The
> contractor should be aware of the impact on beneficiary deductibles
> and coinsurance in a Part B bankruptcy.
>
> d.Contractors should check with RO before making other payments to
> provider.
>
> It is important that intermediaries, carriers, and DMERCs establish a
> process to ensure they do not make payments (e.g., underpayments, lump
> sum payments, or payments resulting from appeals) to bankrupt
> providers who have outstanding overpayments unless the RO (in
> consultation with regional counsel) so directs. This is especially
> critical for intermediaries who must continue to settle open cost
> reports.

4\. Contractors Will Track and Report Information to RO.

> a.Cost Report Settlements and Claims Processed
>
> Contractor staff should notify the RO promptly of any and all proposed
> cost report settlements, changes in the amount of determined
> overpayments or underpayments, and claims processed.
>
> b.Appeals
>
> If a bankrupt provider files an appeal on an overpayment, contractor
> staff must keep RO staff informed on the outcome of the appeal.
> Appeals may take place at the contractor location, with an
> Administrative Law Judge, or at any Office of Hearings and Appeals, at
> the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, or at Federal District Court.
> If the appeal is favorable to the provider, it may require CMS to
> amend its proof of claim because the provider would have a smaller
> overpayment. Alternatively, in some cases, the RO may direct the
> contractor to freeze any outgoing funds. The contractor will keep the
> RO and Regional Counsel updated on the status of appeals.

5\. Record-Keeping.

> a.Interest
>
> The RO will advise the contractor whether or not it should continue to
> calculate interest for overpayments. Medicare\'s ability to assess
> interest varies based on the circumstances of the case. RO will
> consult with the Regional Counsel before determining whether the
> contractor should make an adjustment. If the bankruptcy is in a
> district where interest
>
> should stop accruing on the petition filing date, the contractor must
> make an adjustment to remove the interest.
>
> The contractor should post these adjustments to the contractors\'
> internal systems, the Provider Overpayment Reporting System (PORS) and
> the Physician Supplier Overpayment Report (PSOR) within ten (10) days
> of notice of transaction. The PORS reflects interest assessed and the
> PSOR reflects interest collected. It should also post the adjustments
> to the CMS 750/751 reports.
>
> b.PORS/PSOR Update
>
> RO will instruct the contractor to update the PORS/PSOR with
> appropriate bankruptcy status codes.
>
> c.Bankruptcy Case At Contractor\'s Location.
>
> RO will inform the contractor that they may not refer bankruptcy cases
> to the Debt\
> Collection Center for collection under the Debt Collection Improvement
> Act. If the contractor has already referred a case to DCC and no
> recovery action has begun, the RO will take steps to retrieve the
> case. The overpayment case will remain at the contractor location for
> financial reporting purposes until the case is ready for termination
> write-off, or until the RO advises the contractor otherwise.

**140.4.4 - Tracking Debts/CO Communications (Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

Financial Reporting. While the lead RO is responsible for managing the
bankruptcy case, all bankruptcy debt will remain at the contractor
location for financial reporting purposes on the CMS 750/751 report. RO
staff must work with contractor staff to ensure proper reporting on CMS
751 reports throughout the bankruptcy.

**140.5 - Chain Bankruptcies**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

**140.5.1 - Chain Providers**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

A chain provider is one that is owned by the same entity that owns
another provider or providers. Chain affiliates may include facilities
that are public, private, charitable, or proprietary. They may also
include subsidiary organizations and holding corporations.
Provider-based facilities, such as hospital-based clinics, are not chain
affiliates (MFMM § 2760.1).

As set forth in the lead RO for a bankruptcy is generally the office
with jurisdiction over the state in which the provider files for
bankruptcy. Nevertheless, Central Office staff may assign a chain
bankruptcy to a specific region, or the Regional Counsel may request
that a specific RO take the lead in a specific chain bankruptcy.

When a chain files bankruptcy, there may be multiple contractors
involved in processing payments for the chain. If the bankruptcy
involves other ROs and their contractors, the lead RO will work directly
with the contractors, after informing their home RO(s) that they will be
communicating directly with their contractor on the bankruptcy case. The
lead RO and Regional Counsel are responsible for making

all decisions. However, the lead RO should keep the contractor\'s home
RO informed about its contractor\'s workload in connection with the
bankruptcy.

**140.5.2 - Single Providers Serviced by a National Contractor (Rev. 12,
10-18-02)**

When a single provider who is serviced by a national contractor files
for bankruptcy, the same principle for processing a bankruptcy of a
chain provider will apply. The location where the bankruptcy is filed
will determine the lead RO. The lead RO will work directly with the
national contractor staff on the bankruptcy case. The lead RO will keep
the home RO of the national contractor informed in all issues related to
the case (e.g., a provider within the jurisdiction of the San Francisco
RO files for bankruptcy and their contractor is Mutual of Omaha). The
San Francisco RO will assume lead responsibilities and will keep the
Kansas City RO informed of all issues related to this case.

**140.6 - Affirmative Recovery Actions**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

**140.6.1 - Working With the RO and Regional Counsel\'s Office (Rev. 12,
10-18-02)**

The contractor will notify the RO/Regional Counsel\'s office immediately
after it receives information that a provider has filed for bankruptcy.
It is essential that you obtain information on all Part A, Part B, or
DME entities involved in the bankruptcy, including Medicare identifying
information, such as provider and supplier numbers. If the contractor
has difficulty obtaining this information, it will consult with the
RO/Regional Counsel. After gathering the information described in , it
will send it to the RO.

The contractor will discuss with RO/Regional Counsel whether it should
put payments in administrative freeze (a holding account) until Medicare
has time to assess its position in the bankruptcy. Also, during initial
discussions with Regional Counsel, the RO will determine when the proof
of claim is due and whether the Regional Counsel or the RO will need
additional information to prepare the proof of claim.

The contractor shall share all new information regarding the provider\'s
overpayments and\
underpayments, cost report settlements, etc. with RO/Regional Counsel.
The contractor will not take any further steps without obtaining the
advice of RO/Regional Counsel. For example, the contractor should not
send any overpayment letters to the debtor without RO/Regional Counsel
approval. In addition, the contractor should not initiate new
withholding or discontinue withholding without RO/Regional Counsel
approval.

As the bankruptcy progresses, the Regional Counsel may ask the
contractor to expedite settlement of cost reports, update the Regional
Counsel on provider overpayments or underpayments, and provide Counsel
with assistance on all aspects of the bankruptcy. As bankruptcy cases
often have short deadlines for filing pleadings and other documents,
requests from RO/Regional Counsel must have the highest priority in the
workload, in order to protect Trust Fund assets.

**140.6.2 - Assumption of the Medicare Provider Agreement (Rev. 12,
10-18-02)**

The Medicare Part A Provider Agreement is considered an executory
contract for purposes of bankruptcy. Bankruptcy law permits a debtor to
affirm (\"assume\") or reject each of its executory contracts. The
debtor must first get the formal approval of the bankruptcy court.

If the debtor formally assumes the Medicare provider agreement, and the
Bankruptcy Court approves that assumption, the relationship between the
provider and Medicare will generally return to the ordinary course of
business. The RO will inform the contractor if the provider assumes the
Provider Agreement.

If the debtor rejects the Provider Agreement, the rejection is a
voluntary termination of the Provider Agreement. The RO will inform the
contractor if the provider terminates its provider agreement in this
way. The contractor should not reimburse the provider for services it
performs after the date it rejects/terminates the Provider Agreement.

If the bankrupt provider sells a facility to another entity and that
entity assumes the debtor\'s provider agreement, any outstanding
Medicare underpayments or overpayments regarding that facility should be
transferred to the new owner (the purchaser) when the new owner assumes
the provider agreement. Although the debtor and the new owner may have a
private agreement regarding who is responsible for refunding Medicare
overpayments and who should receive any Medicare underpayments, CMS is
not bound by such agreements.

The contractor shall calculate net amounts that may be due to or owing
from the debtor **140.6.3 - Settlement Agreements or Stipulations**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

During the course of a bankruptcy, the RO and the Regional Counsel,
working with DOJ, may negotiate a settlement agreement or stipulation
with the debtor\'s attorney. Once a settlement agreement or stipulation
goes into effect, the RO will advise all affected contractors, ROs, and
the Office of Financial Management, CO. The contractors will consult
with the lead RO to ensure that they conform to the conditions
established in the settlement agreement or stipulation.

**140.6.4 - Recoupment**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

Generally, bankruptcy law prohibits recovery of prepetition debt (debt
arising prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition) from
postpetition payments. However, Medicare Part A payments require
adjustments of ongoing payments to a provider to account for
overpayments previously made to that provider. 42 U.S.C. §1395g(a);
§1395x(v)(1)(A). Most courts recognize this method of adjusting payments
as recoupment, which is permitted in bankruptcy, and is not subject to
the automatic stay.

Alternatively, they recognize that bankruptcy law does not alter the
adjustment of payments that the Medicare statute requires. Thus, in most
jurisdictions recoupment is appropriate. Nevertheless, the contractor
should always consult RO/Regional Counsel\'s office about the adjustment
(or recoupment) of any payments to a bankrupt provider before you take,
omit, continue or discontinue any action. (See also, discussion of
Recoupment in .

Some courts do not agree that Medicare can recoup overpayments (without
first obtaining relief from the automatic stay), unless the provider
incurred the overpayments in the current fiscal year. For instance, in
bankruptcy cases filed in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the
Virgin Islands, Medicare cannot recoup overpayments across fiscal years
unless the debtor assumes the Medicare provider agreement or Regional
Counsel obtains permission from the court. RO/Regional Counsel will
advise the contractor whether it can recoup overpayments in these
jurisdictions. Again, the contractor must consult RO/Regional Counsel
before adjusting or recouping payments to a bankrupt provider.

**140.6.5 - Administrative Freeze/Set-off --**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

Medicare can ask the court\'s permission to set-off prepetition debts
against prepetition payments (payments for prepetition services, even if
made postpetition) and postpetition debts against postpetition payments
(payments for postpetition services). Regional Counsel, through DOJ will
file a motion requesting permission to set-off.

Bankruptcy law allows a creditor like Medicare to freeze payments if it
thinks it has the right to set-off those payments. Generally, in the
Part A context, the first 2-3 weeks of Medicare payments after a debtor
files for bankruptcy result from prepetition services. Therefore, the RO
and Regional Counsel might decide to freeze all payments for prepetition
services and then request bankruptcy court permission to set-off those
payments against prepetition overpayments. Because there is such a short
period during which there might be prepetition payments available to
set-off available to freeze for set-off, it is critical to find out
about the bankruptcy and the provider\'s overpayments quickly.

Other prepetition payments, such as underpayments or payments delayed
because of medical review may be available to set-off against
prepetition overpayments. It is important to notify the RO and Regional
Counsel of any such underpayments or delayed payments.

Finally, because the U.S. Government is considered one creditor in
bankruptcy, a contractor may be asked to freeze prepetition payments to
recover the debts owed by the provider to other government agencies.
However, we must use prepetition payments to recover Medicare
overpayments before applying them to debts owed to other agencies.

**140.7 - Preparing and Filing Proof of Claim (Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

We provide a working definition of the term \"claim\" in The proof of
claim form alerts the court to the existence of Medicare\'s claim. While
exceptions exist, the general rule of thumb is that in order to share in
the bankruptcy estate Medicare must file a proof of claim. Regional
Counsel will file the proof of claim. It is critical that contractors
produce accurate and detailed overpayment data to the RO and Regional
Counsel when requested so that Regional Counsel can file a timely proof
of claim.

In Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcies, the deadline (\"bar date\")
for the Government to file a proof of claim is 180 days after the
bankruptcy court\'s order granting relief from creditors (usually the
date the provider files for bankruptcy). The bankruptcy court
establishes the bar date by court order in Chapter 9 and Chapter 11
bankruptcies. In order to meet the bar date the Government must:

> 1.Get notice of the bankruptcy;
>
> 2.Direct that notice to the appropriate agency and appropriate
> personnel;
>
> 3.Determine exactly how many payment agreements the entity in
> bankruptcy has with Medicare (i.e., do they owe Medicare and if so how
> much);
>
> 4.Determine the status of each payment agreement
>
> 5.Prepare the proof of claim form;
>
> 6.Get Regional Counsel approval;
>
> 7.Sign it; and
>
> 8.File it in the bankruptcy court.

Because the time to finalize a proof of claim can be short, contractors
should update overpayment information on an ongoing basis.

**140.8 - Closure of Bankruptcy Cases and Treatment Of Overpayment
Reporting Systems at End of Bankruptcy**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

**140.8.1 - Closing the Bankruptcy Case**\
**(Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

After a bankruptcy case is fully administered and the bankruptcy court
has discharged the trustee (if there was one), the bankruptcy court
closes the case. RO/Regional Counsel will provide guidance to the
contractor regarding any required further actions.

Once the debtor has emerged from bankruptcy it resumes business as
usual. A Chapter 11 bankruptcy ordinarily ends with the debtor emerging
from Chapter 11 with a confirmed plan of reorganization. The ordinary
course of business typically begins on the \"effective date\" of the
plan of reorganization. In the case of a Chapter 7, the bankruptcy
typically ends when the Trustee has dissolved the corporation, shut down
operations, and distributed assets to pay creditors. RO/Regional Counsel
will provide specific guidance to the contractor.

When a bankruptcy case closes, whether a Chapter 7, a Chapter 11, or a
proceeding under some other chapter of the bankruptcy code, the
contractor must modify its financial records to reflect the outcome of
the bankruptcy. In general, amounts that bankruptcy law does not require
the provider to repay are considered \"discharged,\" and Medicare must
release the provider from liability for the debt.

All of the contractor\'s debt information, including the POR, PSOR,
CMS-750, CMS-751, and Schedule 9 of contractor\'s financial statement,
must incorporate the bankruptcy outcome by writing off or adjusting the
amounts owed in accordance with applicable bankruptcy orders. This
frequently will require you to remove line items and include new line
items on affected reports. You must maintain detailed support for all
revisions, as well as for any extended repayment arrangements. Detailed
documentation related to principal, interest charges and immediate
payments and extended repayment plans without interest are especially
important in global settlement adjustments which are common in chain
bankruptcy situations. These amounts may need to be modified based on
the global settlement. In global settlements which may cut across
providers in a chain, existing amounts may be removed from the provider
listing and the new amount(s) substituted in accordance with the
bankruptcy documents. This will require close coordination among the
Regional Counsel, the RO, CO and affected contractor staff. Coordination
and immediate action is especially important if you discover that a
bankruptcy discharge for a provider has occurred in a previously unknown
bankruptcy proceeding.

Occasionally, the court dismisses a bankruptcy because the debtor does
not qualify for bankruptcy or for some other reason. When there is a
dismissal, with the advice of Regional Counsel, the RO and contractor
can usually treat the case as if the bankruptcy had never occurred and
continue the normal recovery process, which might include an \"intent to
refer\" letter and subsequent transfer to the Debt Collection Center.
Contractors and ROs must ensure that their internal processing systems
and financial reports no longer reflect the case as one under
bankruptcy, and interest should be reassessed.

Always contact the RO/Regional Counsel for guidance on the closure of a
bankruptcy. There is no formula for closing a bankruptcy, as it all
depends upon the nature of the proceedings and the court orders in the
case. The closure could be preceded by a successful reorganization under
Chapter 11, a conversion to Chapter 7, or the result of a settlement
agreement or stipulation. In all cases, obtain approval from the
RO/Regional Counsel before closing the bankruptcy.

**140.8.2 - Debt Located at the Debt Collection Center or Department of
the Treasury (Rev. 12, 10-18-02)**

If a debt is at the Debt Collection Center (DCC) and the provider files
for bankruptcy, the certifier of the debt (contractor or RO) must
immediately notify the Central Office Division of Financial Reporting
and Debt Referral (DFRDR). The certifier must request that Central
Office recall this debt from DCC as debts in bankruptcy status are
ineligible for crossservicing and offset.

> **NOTE:** Debts for unfiled cost reports are not reported on the H751
> and/or R751, therefore, if these debts become \"bankrupt,\" you will
> record no transaction on these forms.

If the debt is active (less than two years old), the DFRDR, Central
Office will recall the debt, update the POR/PSOR to reflect a bankruptcy
status, and change the location back to the contractor location. DCB
will send an email or fax of the location change to the RO.

If the DCC or Department of Treasury receives the initial notification
of a bankruptcy filing while servicing a debt, they will notify CMS
Central Office, who, in turn, will notify the RO of the bankruptcy.

**140.8.3 - Managing Bankruptcy Debt at the Contractor Location (Rev.
12, 10-18-02)**

All bankruptcy debts will remain at the contractor location throughout
the life of the debt. The lead RO will assume full ownership and the
responsibility for managing the debt at the respective contractor site.

The contractor, will help the RO establish communication procedures and
will ensure that contractor staff follow them.

When chain providers are involved, the lead RO will contact the
appropriate contractor and RO staff and establish dialogue procedures
that will provide timely and accurate transfer of required information.

The lead RO is responsible for management of the debt from the initial
filing of the Proof of Claim until the closure of the Bankruptcy. The
Associate Regional Administrator for the Division of Financial
Management will have the authority to terminate collection activity for
cases that meet the criteria for being written off at the Associate
Regional Administrator level.

**150 - ACCELERATED PAYMENTS- FI ONLY (Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

An accelerated payment may be issued where there is:

> •A delay in payment by the FI for covered services rendered to
> beneficiaries and this delay has caused financial difficulties for the
> provider,
>
> •In highly exceptional situations where a provider has incurred a
> temporary delay in its bill processing beyond the provider's normal
> billing cycle, or
>
> •In highly exceptional situations where CMS deems an accelerated
> payment is appropriate.

A request for an accelerated payment shall not be approved unless the
provider meets all eligibility requirements, including an assurance that
recoupment of the payment will be made on a timely basis. The amount of
the accelerated payment is computed as a percentage (sufficient to
alleviate the impaired cash position but in no case to exceed 70
percent) of the amount of net reimbursement represented by unbilled
discharges or unpaid bills applicable to covered services rendered to
beneficiaries.

Accelerated payments shall be approved by the FI and the appropriate
regional office. The regional office will review each request for an
accelerated payment to assure that the accelerated payment provisions
are being correctly and consistently applied and to provide the
Administration with timely information concerning provider and FI bill
processing.

**150.1 - Eligibility for Accelerated Payment (Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

Provider eligibility for accelerated payments is contingent on the
provider meeting all of the following conditions;

•A shortage of cash exists whereby the provider cannot meet current
financial obligations; and

> •The impaired cash position described in "A" is due to abnormal delays
> in claims processing and/or payment by the FI. However, request for
> accelerated payments based on isolated temporary provider billing
> delays may also be approved where the delay is for a period of time
> beyond the provider's normal billing cycle. In this instance, the
> provider must assure and demonstrate that the causes of its billing
> delays are being corrected and are not chronic; and
>
> •The provider's impaired cash position would not be alleviated by
> receipts anticipated within 30 days which would enable the provider to
> meet current financial obligations; and
>
> •The basis for financial difficulty is due to a lag in Medicare
> billing and/or payments and not to other third-party payers or private
> patients; and
>
> •The FI is assured that recovery of the payment can be accomplished
> according to the instructions in §150.4.

**NOTE:** Each FI is cautioned that neither the revision of the current
financing regulations nor the recovery of current financing payments is
a basis for justifying a provider's request for an accelerated payment.

150.2- Computation of the Accelerated Payment

(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)\
To compute the accelerated payment on account:

1\. Determine the amount of the interim reimbursement for unbilled and
unpaid claims;

2\. Subtract the deductibles and coinsurance amounts, and

3\. Multiply by 70% to determine the net reimbursable amount which can
be paid to the provider.

**150.3** - **Recoupment of the Accelerated Payment**\
**(Rev. 227, Issued: 09 17-13, Effective: 10-04-13, Implementation:
10-04-13)**

The Medicare Contractor shall attempt to recover any accelerated payment
within 90 days after it is issued. To the extent that a delay in the
provider's billing process is the basis for the accelerated payment,
recoupment is made by a 100 percent withhold against the provider's
bills processed by the (Part A) contractor or other monies due the
provider after the date of issuance of the accelerated payment. Any
remainder is recovered by direct payment by the provider not later than
90 days after issuance of the accelerated payment.

If the payment is necessitated by abnormal delays in claims processing
and/or payment by the contractor, recovery by recoupment will be
reasonably scheduled to coincide with improvement in the contractor's
bill processing situation and such recoupment will not impair the
provider's cash position.

In this situation, recoupment shall be completed within 90 days of the
contractor processing the provider's claims.

If recovery is not complete 90 days after the accelerated payment is
issued or 90 days after the contractor begins processing claims, the
accelerated payment is considered delinquent. The contractor shall
immediately send out an initial demand letter. This letter shall state
that 100 percent recoupment by withhold of all payments is in effect and
that the recoupment will remain so until the debt is paid in full or
acceptable payment arrangements are made.

Contractors shall include the "Intent to Refer" language required to
refer the debt to the Treasury Department. (See Chapter 4, §70) Interest
shall begin to accrue on the 31st day after the date of the demand
letter at the prevailing rate set by the Treasury Department. If the
contractor does not hear from the provider within 15 days from the date
of the demand letter, the contractor shall attempt to contact the
provider by telephone. If the demand letter is returned undeliverable
the contractor shall attempt to locate the provider using some of the
guidelines set forth in Chapter 4, §10. If the contractor does not hear
from the provider within 60 days of the date of the demand letter, the
contractor shall input the debt into the Debt Collection System for
referral to the Treasury Department for additional collection activity.

**170 -- General Overpayment Provisions**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

The general overpayment provisions mentioned in this section are
important to the overpayment collection process but could not be
categorized into another section. Some of these provisions require input
from other manual instructions and are only briefly mentioned in this
manual. When necessary, another manual reference has been cited for
additional information.

**170.1 - Offset of Overpayments Against Other Benefits Due -- FI (Rev.
29, 01-02-04)**

**A. Benefits Payable Under Part B - FI**

Where the FI determines that a Part A overpayment has been made to a
provider on behalf of a beneficiary, it shall ascertain whether the
beneficiary is entitled to any Part B payment for the services in
question. (See Medicare Benefit Policy, Chapter 6.) If it appears that
Part B benefits are payable, it shall arrange for billings under Part B.
It shall use any Part B benefit as an offset against the Part A
overpayment.

**B. Use of Lifetime Reserve Days - FI**

If a Part A overpayment for which a beneficiary is liable was caused by
payment for services rendered after exhaustion of benefit period days,
the FI shall reduce the amount of the overpayment by the application of
the beneficiary's lifetime reserve days, unless the individual elected
not to use them. An individual who has been overpaid for services
rendered after exhaustion of benefits can elect not to use reserve days
only if the individual refunds the overpaid amount. (See Medicare
Benefit Policy, Chapter 5.)

**170.2 - When the Carrier Does Not Attempt Recovery Action (Rev. 29,
01-02-04)**

The carrier shall not attempt recovery action on individual overpayments
if:

**A. Total Overpayment Less Than \$10**

The cost of recovering such a small amount ordinarily exceeds the amount
recovered. However, the Carrier shall accept unsolicited overpayment
refunds regardless of the amount. See §160.1 for termination of
collection action procedures.

**B - The Carrier Has Not Taken Action to Reopen the Payment Decision
Within Four Years (48 Months) after the Date of the Initial Payment
Determination**

Unless fraud or similar fault is present, a payment determination may
not be reopened where the Carrier has not taken some action (which can
be documented) questioning the correctness of the determination within 4
years (48 months) after the date the initial determination was approved.
(See Medicare Claims Processing, Chapter 30, Correspondence and Appeals
for policies governing the reopening and revision of decisions to allow
or disallow a claim.)

**C - Payments to Providers for Medically Unnecessary Services or
Custodial Care Where Waiver of Liability Applies**

Where both the beneficiary and provider were without fault (see Medicare
Claims Processing, Chapter 31, Limitation on Liability), the Carrier
shall waive liability for the overpayments.

**170.3 - Information and Help Obtainable from the Social Security
Office (SSO) (Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

Occasionally, it may be possible for the FI or carrier to get
information or help from the local SSO. For instance, if the beneficiary
has moved, the SSO may know the new address, or if the beneficiary has
died, it may know the administrator of the estate. If the beneficiary
takes a check representing an incorrect payment to the SSO, the SSO
forwards the check to the FI or carrier. However, the FI or carrier
shall not ask the SSO to collect, or indirectly aid in, the collection
of an overpayment.

**170.4 - Recovery Where Physician or Other Individual Practitioner Is
Deceased - Carrier Only**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

Where a physician or other individual practitioner who is liable for an
overpayment dies, the\
overpayment should be withheld from other Medicare payments due their
estate. If recovery is not possible by recoupment, the carrier shall
ascertain whether an administrator or executor has been appointed and
then send a letter to the estate of the decedent at the address of the
legal representative, if known, or the last known address of the
deceased.

If the reply to the letter indicates that the estate will not refund the
overpayment, or if a reply is not received within 30 days, the case
should be forwarded to CMS for possible litigation. When referring such
overpayments, the carrier shall include any information about the
appointment of a legal representative, the size of the estate, etc., and
copies of any correspondence with survivors or others concerning the
overpayment.

**170.5 -Provider Offers to Settle on Compromise Basis (Rev. 29,
01-02-04)**

An overpaid provider may offer to compromise an overpayment. The
FI/Carrier shall forward compromise offers to the RO only when further
collection efforts would be unproductive and would not benefit the
Medicare Program.

**170.6 - Unsolicited Overpayment Refunds (Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

When a provider believes that an overpayment has been received and makes
an unsolicited refund, the FI/Carrier accepts it regardless of the
amount. All documentation submitted with the unsolicited refund should
be forwarded to the correct department. (See Program Integrity Manual,
Ch. 3, § 8.4 for unsolicited refunds related to an outstanding fraud
investigation.)

**170.7 - Timely Deposit of Overpayment Refund Checks (Rev. 29,
01-02-04)**

Promptly deposit all refund checks into the Medicare "Federal Health
Insurance Benefits Account". The FI/Carrier shall credit all such
deposits on the day following the date of receipt in its mailroom or
initial point of entry. (It shall credit within 2 days if the bank is
not located in the same city as the contractor.).

(See Ch.5, §100.3)

**170.8 -- Informal Referral to RO**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

For Medicare overpayment purposes a referral is a request to the
Regional Office for assistance in an overpayment. This may be for a
waiver determination, a termination request, a request for technical
assistance, a referral to the Department of Justice, or any other aspect
of the debt collection process. The referral may be in the form of an
email, phone, fax, or written correspondence. Any referral to the RO
should occur before the debt is eligible to be referred to the
Department of Treasury. If changes occur to the debt during the referral
process, the FI/Carrier should immediately notify the RO.

Attachment A, located after the bankruptcy section, includes a referral
checklist that FI/Carrier's should utilize if necessary.

**180 - Reserved**

**(Rev. 227, Issued: 09 17-13, Effective: 10-04-13, Implementation:
10-04-13)**

**190 -- Collection of Fee-for-Service Payments Made During Periods of
Medicare Advantage (MA) Enrollment**\
**(Rev. 315, Issued: 05-17-19, Effective: 06-18- 19, Implementation:
06-18-19)**

The term Medicare beneficiary identifier (Mbi) is a general term
describing a beneficiary's Medicare identification number. For purposes
of this manual, Medicare beneficiary identifier references both the
Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) and the Medicare Beneficiary
Identifier (MBI) during the new Medicare card transition period and
after for certain business areas that will continue to use the HICN as
part of their processes.

Effective October 1, 2003, Common Working File (CWF) implemented the
informational unsolicited response edit based on the same coding files
made available for the reject edits in the risk-based MA Enrollment
coding files described in the CWF System Documentation at

Upon receipt of notification that a beneficiary has previously enrolled
in a MA Plan and the enrollment is posted to the CWF, the CWF will
search claims history to determine whether any fee-for-service claims
were erroneously approved for payment during a period of retroactive MA
enrollment. The CWF compares the period between the MA enrollment start
date and the date of service of the claims in history. Services that
fall within the responsibility of the MA Organizations are identified.

The CWF generates an Informational Unsolicited Response (IUR) with
trailers 05 & 24 containing the identifying information regarding the
claim subject to the risk based MA payment rules. The IUR has all
necessary information to identify the claim including the Internal
Control Number or the Document Control Number, and the Medicare
beneficiary identifier. The CWF electronically transmits the IUR to the
contractor that originally processed the claim. The IUR is included in
the existing CWF response file. The IURs in that file for claims to be
adjusted are identified with a unique transaction identifier.

The previously submitted claim is not canceled and will remain on the
CWF paid claims history file, pending subsequent adjustment.

Upon receipt of the IUR the Shared System software reads the trailer for
each claim and either a manual or automated adjustment is performed. The
contractor must initiate overpayment recovery procedures to retract the
original Part A and Part B payment and must generate an adjustment to
update or cancel the claim to update CWF and contractor history.

**Carriers**

When CWF receives an adjustment for the fee-for-service claim on
history, the deductible is updated on the beneficiary's file, and the
corrected deductible information is returned to the carrier in trailer
11. Carriers are to recover any monies due back to Medicare resulting
from these denials, by following the standard or (customary) recovery
process. Carriers are also responsible for providing the M/A plan number
to the providers in their correspondence.

In the event that a denial is reversed upon appeal, for carrier claims,
the Group Health Organization (GHO) override code of '1' must be used to
allow payment.

**Fiscal Intermediaries (FIs)**

When CWF receives an adjustment for the fee-for-service claim on
history, the deductible is updated on the beneficiary's file, and the
corrected deductible information is returned to the intermediary in
trailer 11. To recover any monies due back to Medicare resulting from
these denials, claims are to be adjusted and overpayments are to be
recovered through the customary recovery process.

In the event that a denial is reversed upon appeal, a 1 byte override
code field is created at the header level for FI claims. The FIs should
use override code "1" in this field for adjustments to all inpatient
claims, including home health. For an Outpatient Denial with a \'N\' No
Pay Code, use a value of \'2\' in the HMO override field. The purpose of
using "1" or "2" is to by-pass the CWF edit, which allows no changes to
the amount initially paid for claims.

**Messages To Be Used With Denials Based On Unsolicited Response**

The following messages should be used when the carrier receives a reject
code from CWF indicating that the services were rendered during a period
when the beneficiary was enrolled in a MA, and billing should have been
submitted to the Managed Care Plan for payment.

**Remittance Advice**

At the claim level, report adjustment reason code 24 - Payment for
Charges Adjusted. Charges are covered under a capitation
agreement/managed care plan.

Information to be made available to providers via letter (or an
alternate method).

**Language for Carriers to Use in Letter to Provider**

**Carriers**

This beneficiary was enrolled in \[Plan Alpha Numeric ID\]; a risked
based managed care organization, for the date of service of this claim.
You must contact the Managed Care organization for payment for these
services. A list that provides the MCO name and address associated with
the MCO number is available on the CMS Internet at

**Fiscal Intermediaries**

The plan number is not required on intermediary communications. Those
providers are to determine which plan to contact through an eligibility
inquiry or by contacting the beneficiary directly.

**New Medicare Summary Notice (MSN)**

The MSN code 16.57 - Medicare Part B does not pay for this item or
service since our records show that you were in an Medicare + Choice
Plan on this date. Your provider must bill this service to the
Medicare + Choice Plan.

16.57 - La Parte B de Medicare no paga por este artículo o servicio ya

the provider is in bankruptcy and appeals an overpayment, the contractor
shall refer to publication 100.06, **C**hapter 4, Bankruptcy, § 140.4.3

The contractor shall cease recoupment or not begin recoupment when a
valid redetermination or reconsideration request is received timely on
an overpayment subject to these limitations (see § 200.1 below). The
provider has until the appeal deadline to file an appeal (refer to\
publication 100.04, Chapter 29). If a provider wants to delay
recoupment, it must submit the redetermination appeal request within 30
days of the demand letter date. To continue the delayed recoupment, the
provider will have 60 days from the redetermination decision to submit a
reconsideration request. If the request is received before the appeal
deadline but after recoupment has started, the contractor shall stop the
recoupment. The contractor shall not refund any monies collected back to
the provider, unless otherwise directed by the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services (CMS). The contractor shall be accountable to ensure
the debts continue to age and accrue interest until the debt is paid in
full.

After the first two levels of appeal are completed, the contractor shall
resume recoupment and Normal debt collection processes. Whether or not
the provider subsequently appeals the overpayment to the ALJ, or
subsequent levels (Department Appeals Board (DAB), or Federal court),
the contractor shall initiate recoupment at 100% until the debt is
satisfied in full, unless an Extended Repayment Schedule (ERS) is
established. If the debt was referred to Treasury and the provider files
for an appeal, the contractor shall recall the debt from Treasury while
in an appeal status. If the appeal decision is unfavorable to the
provider, any outstanding debt will be referred back to Treasury, unless
an approved ERS is established or the provider pays the debt in full.

The contractor shall take the necessary steps to adjust affected account
receivables (AR) after each favorable appeal decision. The contractor
shall apply the funds collected (ERS payments, voluntary payments or
recoupments) to any outstanding eligible overpayments first (monies
shall be applied to interest first and then to principal) and any funds
in excess will then be refunded to the provider.

If the provider prevails at the third level of appeal or higher:

293; Issued: 09-14-17, Effective: 04-02-18, Implementation: 04-02-18)**

> Contractors shall offer providers the opportunity to request immediate
> recoupment. Providers can elect this process to avoid making payment
> by check and/or avoid the assessment of interest if the immediate
> recoupment pays the debt in full before day 31. If providers request
> an immediate

recoupment, they must understand that it is considered a voluntary
repayment. The request for immediate recoupment should be received in
writing at least 16 days from the date of initial demand letter to avoid
the assessment of interest, **however when the request is received after
16 days from the date of the demand letter, the debt shall be placed in
an immediate recoupment status and interest will continue to accrue if
the debt is not fully collected by day 31.**

***A.***Contractors shall offer two immediate recoupment options.

> *1.*A one-time request on the total overpayment amount (All accounts
> receivables) in a single demand letter and any future demanded
> overpayments; Or
>
> *2.*A request on the demanded overpayment (All accounts receivables)
> addressed in a single demand letter only.

***B.***Contractors shall incorporate the following minimum information
related to "immediate recoupment" on its website:

> *1.*This option is **ONLY** for overpayments that receive a demand
> letter.
>
> •The request must be in writing, and may be submitted using regular
> mail, Facsimile, or email with an encrypted file.
>
> •The request must include the following:
>
> *1.*Provider Name and contact phone number\
> *2.*Provider's Medicare Number and/or the National Provider
> Identification (NPI) *3.*Provider, Administrator or CFO's signature
> (someone with authority is required to sign)\

> *5.*Which option the provider is requesting
>
> •The contractor shall scan, copy or keep the original request for
> proof of receipt.
>
> *2.*Contractors shall use their discretion when a provider does not
> submit all 5 requirements to either:
>
> • Reach out to provider for the missing information or • Not accept
> the request based on missing information
>
> *3.*Contractors shall continue to maintain or update the website on
> the immediate recoupment
>
> process as needed.
>
> ***C.***Contractors shall inform providers that going through the
> immediate recoupment process is considered voluntary payments and will
> not be subject to 935 (f)(2) interest pursuant to § 1893(f)(2).
>
> ***D.***Contractors shall consider all written requests for an
> immediate recoupment as a payment arrangement that constitutes a
> voluntary payment except for immediate recoupment 30 calendar days
> after reconsideration decision.
>
> • When the provider appeals to the ALJ and prevails.
>
> *1.*Any money recouped (applied to the principal balance) 30 days

**E. Initiating or resuming recoupment after a Withdrawal or Dismissal**

> **1.** **Contractors [shall]{.underline} initiate or resume recoupment
> following:**
>
> A request for a withdrawal from the provider or other suppliers or a
> redetermination dismissal.
>
> • Remove the appeal status as soon as possible but no later than 30
> calendar days from the dismissal notification to resume recoupment.
>
> **Exception to Recoupment:**\
> **2.** When the Qualified Independent Contractor determines the
> Redetermination dismissal was\
> in error, vacates the dismissal and remands the case back to the
> contractor.
>
> • Contractors shall update all AR/s back to the\
> Redetermination appeal status and\
> • Handle as a new Redetermination within eight (8) business days from
> the receipt date of the remand notification.
>
> **3.** For additional guidance, refer to 42 CFR §§405.379, 405.952 and

> 09-29-08)**
>
> If a provider, physician or other suppliers has been granted an
> extended repayment schedule (ERS) and submitted a valid and timely
> request for a redetermination or reconsideration to the Medicare
> contractor, the provider or supplier will not be\
> considered in default if payments were not made by the provider. The

> this would have been put on withhold due to default of payment). The
> contractor shall send a notice to the provider that it must resume its
> ERS payments or be placed on recoupment according to IOM 100.6 chapter
> 4 §50.
>
> Payments made by a provider under an ERS are not recoupments for the
> limitation provision and are not subject to 935 interest if reversed
> at the ALJ appeal or above.
>
> However, if a provider defaults on the ERS schedule and recoupment
> begins before a valid and timely request has been received, those
> recoupments are subject to payment of interest under the 935 interest

> is to be paid to a provider or supplier whose overpayment
> determination is overturned in administrative or judicial appeals
> subsequent to the second level of appeal (QIC reconsideration). This
> is called 935 interest, which is payable on an underpayment where the

> administrative appeal based on the period that\
> Medicare recouped the provider's or supplier's funds. Payment of 935
> interest is only applicable to overpayments recovered under the

>
> The simple formula for calculating interest is: 1) Time; 2) Rate; and
> 3) Amount For each recoupment action:
>
> 1.**TIME**: Determine the total Julian Days starting from the
> recoupment date to the ALJ Decision date or date the revised notice
> with the new overpayment, if applicable. Divide the number of Julian
> days by 30 to compute the number of 30-day periods. The interest will
> not be payable for any periods of less than 30 days in which we had
> possession of the recouped funds.
>
> 2.**RATE**: Use the Annual Rate of interest at the time of the ALJ
> decision date or from the revised New Written Determination date from
> an effectuation and convert interest rate to a monthly interest rate.
> (For example: The Rate of Interest as of April 18, 2008 is 11.375%).
> Convert annual Rate to a monthly rate by dividing by 12.
>
> 3.**AMOUNT**: The amounts that are to be used as the basis on which to
> compute interest earned by the provider are those amounts that are
> credited to principal resulting from any involuntary payments from the
> provider after the\
> elimination/satisfaction of all Medicare debt. Recouped monies applied
> to interest are not included in determining the 935 interest. Only
> those principal funds recouped via withholding (e.g. payments recouped
> under a defaulted ERS or offset) are included. Do not include payments
> a provider makes under an ERS or other voluntary payments made by the
> provider.
