**10 - Requirements for Collecting Part A and B Non-MSP Provider
Overpayments *(Rev. 11787; Issued:01-19-23; Effective: 04-21-23;
Implementation:04-21-23)***

**For purposes of these instructions, the term Provider, Physician and
other Supplier will be referred to as "Provider".**

The following collection activities are the minimum requirements the
Medicare contractor (contractor) shall follow for all Non-MSP provider
overpayments. Where additional information is located elsewhere in the
manual chapter, an annotation of the specific section is included. (See
Medicare Financial Management Manual, Publication 100-06, Chapter 3,
§40).

**1. Initial Demand letter**

The contractor shall send an initial demand letter within established
timeframes of the identification or notification of an overpayment. The
contractor shall ensure the date of the initial demand letter is the
date the AR is established and the date the letter is mailed. The
initial demand letter shall include all required language and shall meet
timeliness standards as outlined in chapter 3 §200 and/or chapter 4 §§20
and 90.

**a. Dollar threshold**

The threshold amount to send the initial demand letters is \$25
(principal). The contractor shall aggregate all of the overpayments to
the provider to meet the threshold amount for the initial demand letter.

**b. Undeliverable demand letter**

If the contractor receives the initial demand letter back as
undeliverable, the contractor shall attempt to reach the provider by
telephone within 10 business days of receiving the undeliverable letter.

If the contractor is unsuccessful at reaching the provider by telephone,
the contractor shall at the minimum attempt to locate the provider
through other means including:

> • Querying the Provider Enrollment Change of Ownership System (PECOS)
> to determine if there is updated contact information (including an
> email address) for the provide);
>
> • Contacting the medical review staff or fraud and abuse staff for
> possible updates on the debtor's whereabouts;
>
> • Conducting research to see if the provider is in bankruptcy or
> litigation, and by using the name of the owners, partners, or the
> corporation officers;\
> • Conducting an internet search site, including using Lexis-Nexis® or
> a similar program;
>
> • Contacting the servicing regional office (RO) for assistance or
> further guidance, if the contractor does not have access to a search
> engine.

The contractor shall document in the case file all attempts to contact
the provider.

**2. Recoupment**

The contractor shall initiate recoupment of the debt, or any remaining
balance of the debt, as outlined below, except when the debt is in the
following status: (1) appeal subject to the Limitation on Recoupment
provisions (redetermination/reconsideration), (2) bankruptcy, (3)
Extended Repayment Schedule (ERS) or (4) a pending ERS request.

For Part A (Non-935 Overpayments)

• Recoupment shall begin 16 days from the date of initial demand letter
if the debt is not subject to Limitation on Recoupment provisions of
Section 935(f)(2) of the MMA. (See chapter 3, §200) For Part B (935 and
Non-935) and Part A 935 Overpayments\
• Recoupment shall begin 41 days from the date of the initial demand
letter.

> • Recoupment shall continue until the debt is collected in full or is
> in a status that excludes recoupment.

**3. Interest**\
If the overpayment is not paid in full 30 days from the date of the
initial demand letter, contractors shall ensure that interest is
assessed beginning on day 31. Simple interest shall be charged on the
outstanding principal balance of the debt starting with the date of the
initial demand letter and for every 30*-*day period thereafter, until
the debt is paid in full. Refer to chapter 4, §30 and 42 CFR 405.378 for
additional information.

**4. Telephone Contacts:**\
Contractors shall attempt to contact providers by phone, at least twice,
as follows:\
**a.First telephone contact**\
•**Providers who have been terminated/revoked/ or have withdrawn from
the Medicare** **program:**\
oThe telephone contact shall be made within 10 business days of the
contractor's notification of termination/revocation/withdrawal.

> •**Active Providers:**\
> oThe telephone contact shall be made when the debt is at least 60 days
> delinquent (90 days from the date of the demand letter) and is not in
> an appeal, litigation, ERS, or bankruptcy status.
>
> oThe telephone contact may be made sooner if the contractor believes
> that earlier contact may result in a collection.
>
> oIn situations where the provider cannot be reached by telephone the
> contractor shall leave a voicemail as needed.
>
> •**Successful Phone Contact:**\
> oThe contractor shall inform the provider of repayment options (e.g.
> ERS) and explain that any unpaid delinquent debt will be referred to
> Treasury for further collection activity. If the provider has a surety
> bond, the contractor shall inform the provider that the debt will be
> collected through the surety, and any remaining balance will be
> referred to Treasury.
>
> oIf the first call is successful, (second call would not be necessary)
> document the contact.
>
> •**Unsuccessful Phone Contact**\
> oThe contractor shall discontinue telephone efforts when a provider's
> number is disconnected.
>
> oThe contractor shall at the minimum attempt to locate the provider
> through other means as listed in discussion of undeliverable demand
> letters, section 1(b), above.
>
> **b.Second Phone Contact**\
> The second phone call is only necessary if the contractor was unable
> to directly communicate with the provider on the first call.
>
> •The contractor shall make a second phone call to the provider at
> least 7 business days before referring the debt to Treasury.
>
> •The contractor shall leave a voicemail where the call is directed to
> voice messaging.
>
> •Leaving the second voicemail message shall be sufficient for
> attempting to reach the provider by telephone.
>
> The contractor shall document, in the case file, all attempts to
> contact the provider.

**5. Extended Repayment Schedule (ERS)**\
If the provider submits an application for an ERS, the contractor shall
follow the instructions in Chapter 4 §50. An ERS application may be
requested at any time during the collection process.

**6. Intent to Refer (ITR) letter**\
For providers who have been terminated/revoked or have withdrawn from
the Medicare program: The contractor shall send the ITR letter:\
•If the initial demand letter was returned undeliverable and a better
address cannot be located (see below for Instructions Summary for
Undeliverable Letters), or\
•When the contractor has verified in PECOS or Provider Enrollment that
the provider is terminated or out of business.

> oThe contractor utilizing HIGLAS shall manually update the accounts
> receivable (AR) status code to 'PROVIDER-TERMINATED' if the ITR has
> not been issued and the contractor learns that the provider is
> terminated or out of business. HIGLAS will not allow the AR status
> code to be updated to 'PROVIDER-TERMINATED' if the existing AR status
> code is exempt from Treasury referral.
>
> oThe contractor utilizing HIGLAS shall manually add a comment to the
> AR status indicating that the provider has been terminated or out of
> business, when a provider has been terminated or is out of business
> and has an AR with a status code that is ineligible for Treasury
> referral"\
> oThe contractor not utilizing HIGLAS shall manually create the ITR
> letter and send it as soon as possible if an ITR letter has not been
> issued and the contractor learns that the provider is terminated or
> out of business.

**For active providers:**

The contractor shall send the ITR letter when the debt is **at least**
30 days delinquent (60 days from the determination date)\* and is not in
a status excluded from debt referral.

**NOTE:** In all cases, the contractor shall ensure that the ITR letter
is sent in enough time to allow the debtor 60 days' notice prior to
referral to Treasury. In accordance with provisions of the Digital
Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) which amended the
Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA), eligible delinquent
debts must be referred to Treasury by the 120th day of delinquency.
(Refer to chapter 4, §70 for further detail.)\
\* The Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS)
adds an additional 5 grace days when determining when to generate the
ITR letter to allow for interest accruals to appear on the ITR letter;
therefore, the ITR letter will be system generated on day 66.

\* **Instructions Summary for Undeliverable Letters**

> 1.If the contractor utilizing HIGLAS cannot locate a better address
> within 10 business days of receipt of the undeliverable demand letter,
> the contractor shall manually update the status code to
> 'LTR-UNDL-1ST.'
>
> 2.If the contractor locates a better address for the undeliverable
> initial demand letter, the contractor shall send the provider a manual
> undeliverable demand notification letter, with the initial demand
> letter attached, to the better address. The original initial demand
> letter date shall remain in effect.
>
> 3.If the contractor not utilizing HIGLAS cannot locate a better
> address within 10 business days of receipt of the undeliverable
> initial demand letter, the contractor shall manually create the ITR
> letter immediately and send it as soon as possible.
>
> 4.If the ITR letter is returned as undeliverable and a better address
> cannot be located within 10 business days of receipt, the contractor
> utilizing HIGLAS shall update the status code to 'LTR-UNDL-ITR.'
>
> 5.If the contractor locates a better address for the undeliverable ITR
> letter, the contractor shall send the provider a manual undeliverable
> ITR notification letter, with the original ITR letter attached, to the
> better address. The original ITR letter date shall remain in effect.

**Note:** The HIGLAS logic will review the letter history and the debt
will become eligible for referral to Treasury 66 days from the ITR
letter date.

**7. Surety Bond**

Prior to referral to Treasury, DME contractors shall refer to
instructions outlined in Medicare Program Integrity Manual,
Publication100-08, chapter 15, §21.7.1.

**8. Record Keeping**

The contractor shall keep records of all collection activities through
all stages of the debt collection process. This record shall be detailed
and include all correspondence and conversations with the provider,
checks, and any other documents associated with debt collection
processes.

**10.1 - Required Timeframes for Debt Collection Process for Provider
Overpayments (Rev. 259, Issued: 01-15-16 Effective: 02-16-16,

**20 -- Demand Letters**\
**(Rev. 316, Issued: 05-24-19, Effective: 10-01-19, Implementation:
10-07-19)**

> There are two overpayment demand letters, an Initial Demand Letter and
> an Intent to Refer Letter (ITR) (this does not include notification
> letters or response letters) used in the debt collection process. The
> purpose of an overpayment demand letter is to notify the providers and
> suppliers of the existence and
>
> amount of an overpayment, and to request repayment. Every demand
> letter, regardless of the cause of the overpayment or the status of
> the provider or supplier, shall meet certain requirements as to form

> all-inclusive).
>
> **[Non-Cost Report Overpayment Demand Letters]{.underline}:**
>
> 1.The initial demand letter shall be sent to the provider or supplier

>
> 2.The letters shall be labeled either Initial Demand Letter or The
> Intent to Refer Letter (ITR.).
>
> 3.The initial demand letter shall be sent by first class mail, secured

>
> 4.The initial demand letter is an explanation of the nature of the

>
> 5.The initial demand letter includes language to request the provider

>
> **[Interest Assessment]{.underline}:**
>
> **If you do not refund in 30 days:**

In accordance with 42 CFR 405.378, simple interest at the rate of
&AR_INTEREST_RATE % will be charged on the unpaid balance of the
overpayment, beginning on the 31st day. Interest is calculated in 30-day
periods and is assessed for each full 30-day period that payment is not
made on time. Thus, if payment is received 31 days from the date of
final determination, one 30-day period of interest will be charged. Each
payment will be applied first to accrued interest and then to principal.
After each payment, interest will continue to accrue on the remaining
principal balance, at the rate of\
&AR_INTEREST_RATE %. In addition, please note that Medicare rules
require that payment be either received in our office by &LETTER_DATE_29
(United States Postal Service Postmark) for the payment to be considered
timely. A metered mail postmark received in our office after\
&LETTER_DATE_29 will cause an additional month\'s interest to be
assessed on the debt.

**[Payment by Recoupment:]{.underline}**

If payment in full is not received by &LETTER_DATE_40 (&LETTER_DATE_15
for Part A non-935), payments to you can be recouped (recoupment) until
payment in full is received if you haven\'t submitted an acceptable ERS
request, an immediate recoupment request, and/or a valid and timely
appeal is received.

**[Make a payment or Arrange for payments:]{.underline}**

> accrue until the debt is collected in full.
>
> **If Provider is NOT enrolled in Immediate Recoupment-**

**TO SIMPLIFY THE REPAYMENT PROCESS**, reduce the extra work and cost
associated with mailing your repayment each time, you may elect to have
automatic immediate recoupments for ALL overpayments by requesting the
**Immediate Recoupment** process for All Current and Future Accounts
Receivable. This will automatically begin recoupment starting on day 16
for ALL future accounts receivable. When the initial request is received
after day 16 the debt shall be placed in an immediate recoupment status.
If the debt is not collected in full before day 31, interest will
continue to accrue until the debt is collected in full.

You must specify whether you are submitting:

1\. A request on the current demanded overpayment (all accounts
receivables within this demand letter) and ALL FUTURE OVERPAYMENTS; or

2\. A one-time request on this current demanded overpayment (all
accounts receivables) addressed in this demand letter only.

This process is voluntary and for your convenience.

**You can visit our website at {MAC site} for the Immediate Recoupment
Request instructions.**

You may contact this office for information on how to fax your request.

**[Medicaid Offset]{.underline}:**

If this matter is not resolved, CMS may instruct the Medicaid State
Agency to withhold the Federal share of any Medicaid payments that may
be due you or related facilities until the full amount owed to Medicare
is recouped, Title 42 CFR, § 447.30(g). These recoveries will be in
addition to any recoupments from other Medicare funds due you until the
full amount owed to Medicare is recovered.

**[Right to Inspect Records Prior to Referral to
Treasury]{.underline}:**

In the event an ITR letter is sent, you have the right to inspect and
copy all records pertaining to your debt. In order to present evidence
or review the CMS records, you must submit a written request to the
address below. Your request must be received within 60 calendar days
from the ITR letter date. In response to a timely request for access to
CMS' records, you will be notified of the location and time when you can
inspect and copy records related to this debt. Interest will continue to
accrue during any review period.

Therefore, while review is pending, you will be liable for interest and
related late payment charges on amounts not paid by the due date
identified above.

**[For Individual Debtors Filing a Joint Federal Income Tax
Return]{.underline}:**

The Treasury Offset Program automatically refers debts to the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) for Offset. Your Federal income tax refund is
subject to offset under this program. If you file a joint income tax
return, you should contact the IRS before filing your tax return to
determine the steps to be taken to protect the share of the refund which
may be payable to the non-debtor spouse.

**[For Debtors that Share a Tax Identification Number(s)]{.underline}:**

Section 1866(j)(6) of the Social Security Act authorizes the Secretary
of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to make any necessary
adjustments to the payments of an applicable provider or supplier who
shares a TIN with an obligated provider or supplier, one that has an
outstanding Medicare overpayment. The Secretary is authorized to adjust
the payments of such a provider or supplier regardless of whether it has
been assigned a different billing number or National Provider
Identification Number (NPI) from that of the provider or supplier with
the outstanding Medicare overpayment.

**[Federal Salary Offset]{.underline}:**

If the facility ownership is either a sole proprietorship or
partnership, your individual salary(s) may be offset if you are, or
become, a federal employee.

**[If You Have Filed a Bankruptcy Petition]{.underline}:**

If you have filed a bankruptcy petition or are involved in a bankruptcy
proceeding, Medicare financial obligations will be resolved in
accordance with the applicable bankruptcy process. Accordingly, we

> request that you immediately notify us about this bankruptcy so that
> we may coordinate with both the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid

> sections.\]

**[Why You Are Responsible]{.underline}:**

You are responsible for following correct Medicare filing procedures. In
this situation, you billed and/or received payment for services you
should have known you were not entitled to. Therefore, you are not
without fault and are responsible for repaying the overpayment amount.
If you dispute this\
determination, please follow the appropriate appeals process listed
below. Applicable authorities: § 1870(b) (c) of the Social Security Act;
Sub§ 405.350 - 405.359 of Title 42 CFR, Sub§ 404.506 - 404.509, 404.510a
and\
404.512 of Title 20 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations.

This amount is subject to § 935(f) (2) of the Medicare Modernization Act
(MMA) (section 1893(f) (2) of the Social Security Act), Limitation on
Recoupment (42 CFR 405.379).

**[Rebuttal Process]{.underline}:**

Under our existing regulations at 42 CFR § 405.374, Providers or
Suppliers will have **15 days from the date of this demand letter** to
have an opportunity for rebuttal by submitting a statement. The rebuttal
process provides the debtor the opportunity, before the suspension of
payment, offset, or recoupment takes effect, to submit any statement (to
include any pertinent information) as to why it should not be put into
effect on the date specified in the notice. A rebuttal is not intended
as a request for the review supporting medical documentation nor to
express disagreement with the overpayment decision. A rebuttal shall not
duplicate the redetermination process. T**his is not an appeal of the
overpayment determination. The limitation on recoupment under** [§ 1893
(f) (2) (a)]{.underline} of the Social Security Act **does**

> **not apply to rebuttal requests.** Our office will advise you of our
> decision 15 days from the mailroom-stamped receipt date of your
> request.
>
> **[Interest Assessment]{.underline}:**
>
> **If you do not pay the full amount in 30 days:**
>
> In accordance with 42 CFR 405.378, simple interest at the rate of
> &AR_INTEREST_RATE percent will be charged on the unpaid balance of the
> overpayment, beginning on the 31st day. Interest is calculated in
> 30-day periods and is assessed for each full 30-day period that
> payment is not made on time.

Thus, if payment is received 31 days from the date of final
determination, one 30-day period of interest will be charged. Each
payment will be applied first to accrued interest and then to principal.
After each payment, interest will continue to accrue on the remaining
principal balance, at the rate of\
&AR_INTEREST_RATE percent. A metered mail postmark received in our
office after\
&LETTER_DATE_29 will cause an additional month\'s interest to be
assessed on the debt.

In addition, please note that Medicare rules require that payment be
either received in our office by &LETTER_DATE_29 or United States Postal
Service Postmark by that date for the payment to be considered timely.

**[Suspended Funds Applied To The Overpayment and Has a Remaining
Outstanding Balance]{.underline}:**

If the suspended funds are insufficient to fully eliminate any
overpayment, and the provider or supplier meets the requirements of 42
CFR § 405.379 \"Limitation on Recoupment\" provision under §1893(f) (2)
of the Act, then the provider or supplier is subject to 935 Appeals
rights and will be available for offset after 41 days on the remaining
balance still owed to CMS. (See 42 CFR § 405.372(e) for more
information.)

**[Payment by Recoupment]{.underline}:**

If payment in full is not received by &LETTER_DATE_29 **(date of the
notification),** payments to you can be recouped (recoupment) until
payment in full is received if you haven\'t submitted an acceptable ERS
request, an immediate recoupment request, and/or a valid and timely
appeal is received.

**[Make a Payment or Arrange for Payments]{.underline}:**

>
> Even if the overpayment and any assessed interest has not been paid in
> full, you can temporarily stop Medicare from recouping any payments.
> **If you act quickly and decidedly,** Medicare will **stop
> recoupment** at two points.
>
> **First Opportunity:** We must receive a valid and timely request for
> a redetermination within 30 days from the date of this letter. We will
> stop or delay recoupment pending the results of an appeal. To assist
> us in expeditiously stopping the recoupment process, we request that
> you clearly indicate on your appeal request that this is a 935
> overpayment appeal for a redetermination.
>
> **Second Opportunity:** If the redetermination decision is (1)
> **unfavorable,** we will begin to recoup no earlier than the 60th day
> from the date of the Medicare redetermination notice (Medicare Appeal
> Decision Letter); or (2) if the decision is **partially favorable**,
> we will begin to recoup no earlier than the 60th day from the date of
> the Medicare revised overpayment Notice/Revised Demand Letter.
> Therefore, it is important to act quickly and decidedly to limit
> recoupment by submitting a valid and timely request for
> reconsideration within 60 days of the appropriate notice/letter. The
> address and details on how to file a request for reconsideration will
> be included in the Redetermination decision letter.
>
> **[What Happens Following a Reconsideration By a Qualified Independent
> Contractor (QIC)]{.underline}:**
>
> Following a **decision or dismissal** by the QIC, if the debt has not
> been paid in full, we will begin or resume recoupment whether or not
> you appeal to the next level, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).
>
> **[NOTE]{.underline}:** Even when recoupment is stopped, interest
> continues to accrue.
>
> **[Medicaid Offset]{.underline}:**
>
> If this matter is not resolved, CMS may instruct the Medicaid State
> Agency to withhold the Federal share of any Medicaid payments that may
> be due you or related facilities until the full amount owed to
> Medicare is recouped; Title 42 CFR, § 447.30(g). These recoveries will
> be in addition to any\
> recoupments from other Medicare funds due you until the full amount
> owed to Medicare is recovered.
>
> **[Right to Inspect Records Prior to Referral to
> Treasury]{.underline}:**
>
> In the event an Intent to Refer (ITR) letter is sent, you have the
> right to inspect and copy all records pertaining to your debt. In
> order to present evidence or review the CMS records, you must submit a
> written request to the address below. Your request must be received
> within 60 calendar days from the ITR letter date. In response to a
> timely request for access to CMS's records, you will be notified of
> the location and time when you can inspect and copy records related to

> Therefore, while review is pending, you will be liable for interest

> The Treasury Offset Program automatically refers debts to the Internal

payable to the non-debtor spouse.

**[Medicaid Offset]{.underline}**

If this matter is not resolved within fifteen (15) days from the date of
this letter, CMS may instruct the Medicaid State Agency to withhold the
Federal share of Title XIX of any Medicaid payments that may be due you
or related facilities until the full amount owed Medicare is recouped,
Title 42 CFR, § 447.30(g). These recoveries will be in addition to any
recoupments from other Medicare funds due you until the full amount owed
to Medicare is recovered. The appeal process is detailed in the Notice
of Program Reimbursement (NPR).

**[Interest Assessment:]{.underline}**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  In accordance with 42 CFR 405.378,  will be charged on the
  simple interest at the rate of      
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

unpaid balance of the overpayment beginning on the 31st day. Interest is
calculated in 30-day periods and is assessed for each full 30-day period
that payment is not made in full. Thus, if payment is received 31 days
from the date of final determination, one 30-day period of interest will
be charged and will continue to be assessed for full 30-day periods on
any portion that remains outstanding until the debt is paid in full.

Each payment will be applied first to accrued interest and then to
principal. After each payment, interest will continue to accrue on the
remaining principal balance, at the rate of \_.

**[Extended Repayment Request]{.underline}:**

We request that you refund this amount in full. If you are unable to
make refund of the entire amount at this time, advise this office
immediately so that we may determine if you are eligible for a repayment
schedule. (Referfor details and forms.) Any repayment schedule (where
one is approved) would run from the approval date. If we do not hear
from you, your interim payments will be withheld starting on the 16th
day from the date of this letter, and applied towards the outstanding
overpayment balance.

Any amount withheld will not be refunded.

**[If You Have Filed a Bankruptcy Petition]{.underline}:**

If you have filed a bankruptcy petition or are involved in a bankruptcy
proceeding, Medicare financial obligations will be resolved in
accordance with the applicable bankruptcy process. Accordingly, we
request that you immediately notify us about this bankruptcy so that we
may coordinate with both the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
and the Department of Justice so as to assure that we handle your
situation properly. If possible, when notifying us about the bankruptcy,
please include the name the bankruptcy is filed under and the district
where the bankruptcy is filed.

> Dear Sir/Madam:
>
> On &DATE_OF_ORIGINAL_DEMAND_LETTER, we sent a letter requesting that
> you refund an overpayment made to you in the amount of
> &HINVOICE_AMOUNT that resulted from claim(s) accounts receivable(s).
> As of the date of this letter, we have not yet received payment, an

the balance. The outstanding amount due for this overpayment is
&DEMAND_AMOUNT, which includes a principal amount of
&INVOICE_BALANCE_AMOUNT and interest assessed in the amount of
&INTEREST_BALANCE_AMOUNT.

Your debt to the Medicare Program is delinquent and, by way of this
letter, we are providing notice that your debt may be referred to the
Department of Treasury\'s Debt Collection Center (DCC) for Cross
Servicing and Offset of Federal Payments. Your debt may be referred
under provisions of Federal Law, title 31 of the United States Code, §
3720A, which is a provision of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of
1996.

[**NOTE:** If you have filed a bankruptcy petition or are involved in a
bankruptcy proceeding please]{.underline} [follow the instructions found
at the end of this letter.]{.underline}

**[Repayment]{.underline}**

Your debt will not be referred to the Department of Treasury if you make
payment in full. The past due amount of &DEMAND_AMOUNT owed to the
Medicare Program as of &LETTER_DT includes interest accrued through
&LAST_INTEREST_ACCRUAL_DATE. Interest is accrued monthly and is added to
the balance of the debt.

Your check or money order for the amount due should be made payable to
Medicare and sent with a copy of this letter to:

> &CONTRACTOR_NAME &CHECK_ADDRESS1 &CHECK_ADDRESS2 &CHECK_CITY,
> &CHECK_STATE &CHECK_POSTAL_CODE

If you cannot make payment in full, you may be allowed to enter into an
extended repayment agreement if you are eligible under the requirements
at 42 C.F.R. 401.607(c)(2). If you are interested in an extended
repayment agreement, please contact this office. Refer to your initial
demand letter to determine your rights to an appeal.

**[Referral To The U.S. Department of The Treasury for
Collection]{.underline}**

If your debt remains unpaid 60 days from the date of this letter, your
debt will be referred to the United States Department of the Treasury's
(the Treasury) Debt Management Services for Cross Servicing and Offset
of Federal Payments. Your debt will be referred under 31 U.S.C. 3711(g).
The Treasury's Debt Management Services will use various tools to
collect the debt, including offset of federal payments, demand letters,
phone calls, referral to a private collection agency, and referral to
the U.S. Department of Justice for litigation.

**[Due Process]{.underline}**

You have the right to request an opportunity to inspect and copy records
relating to the debt. This request must be submitted in writing to the
address listed below. You have the right to present evidence that all or
part of your debt is not past due or legally enforceable. In order to
exercise this right, this office must receive a copy of the evidence to
support your position, along with a copy of this letter. You must submit
any evidence that the debt is not owed or legally enforceable within 60
calendar days of the date of this letter. If, after sixty (60) calendar
days from the date of this letter, we have not received such evidence,
your debt, if it is still outstanding and eligible for referral, may be
referred to the Department of Treasury or its designated Debt Collection
Center for cross servicing/offset.

**\[Contractors shall include the following language in all ITR-935
letters after the first paragraph.\]**

Your debt to the Medicare Program is delinquent and, by this letter, we
are providing notice that your debt will be referred to the Department
of Treasury\'s Debt Collection Center (DCC) for Cross Servicing and
Offset of Federal Payments. This could occur should the amounts

> The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA) requires Federal
> agencies to refer delinquent debt to the Department of Treasury and/or
> a designated Debt Collection Center (DCC) for collection through cross
> servicing and/or the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). Under the offset

> other Federal agency payments you may be entitled to, including the
> offset of your income tax return through the Internal Revenue Service
> (IRS). The TOP offsets can also be taken from eligible state payments
> you are entitled to.

The DCC shall use various tools to collect the debt, including offset,
demand letters, phone calls, referral to a private collection agency and
referral to the Department of Justice for litigation. Other collection
tools available, which may be used, include Federal salary offset and
administrative wage garnishment. If the debt is discharged, it may be
reported to the IRS as potential taxable income.

During the collection process, interest shall continue to accrue on the
debt and you shall remain legally responsible for any amount not
satisfied through the collection efforts.

**[For Individual Debtors Filing a Joint Federal Income Tax
Return]{.underline}**

The Treasury Offset Program automatically refers debt to the IRS for
offset. Your Federal income tax refund is subject to offset under this
program. If you file a joint income tax return, you should contact the
IRS before filing your tax return to determine the steps to be taken to
protect the share of the refund, which may be payable to the non-debtor
spouse.

**[Overpayments from Debtors Who Share Tax Identification
Numbers]{.underline}**

Section 1866(j)(6) of the Social Security Act authorizes the Secretary
of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to make any necessary
adjustments to the payments of an applicable provider or supplier who
shares a TIN with an obligated provider or supplier, one that has an
outstanding Medicare overpayment. The Secretary is authorized to adjust
the payments of such a provider or supplier regardless of whether it has
been assigned a different billing number or National Provider
Identification Number (NPI) from that of the provider or supplier with
the outstanding Medicare overpayment.

**[Federal Salary Offset]{.underline}**

If the facility ownership is either a sole proprietorship or
partnership, your individual salary(s) may be offset if you are or
become a federal employee.

**[Medicaid Offset]{.underline}**

If this matter is not resolved, CMS may instruct the Medicaid State
Agency to withhold the\
Federal share of any Medicaid payments that may be due you or related
facilities until the full amount owed to Medicare is recouped, Title 42
CFR, § 447.30(g). These recoveries will be in addition to any recoupment
from other Medicare funds due you until the full amount owed to Medicare
is recovered.

Please read the following instructions carefully to determine what
action you should take to avoid referral for cross servicing/offset.

**[Due Process]{.underline}**

You have the right to request an opportunity to inspect and copy records
relating to the debt. This request must be submitted in writing to the
address listed below. You have a right to present evidence that all or
part of your debt is not past due or legally enforceable. In order to
exercise this right, this office must receive a copy of the evidence to
support your position, along with a copy of this letter. You must submit
any evidence that the debt is not owed or legally enforceable within 60
calendar days of the date of this letter. If, after sixty (60) calendar
days from the date of this letter, we have not received such evidence,
your debt, if it is still outstanding and eligible for referral, shall
be referred to the Department of Treasury or its designated DCC for
cross servicing/offset.

**[Repayment]{.underline}**

Your debt shall not be referred to the Department of Treasury if you
make payment in full. The past due amount owed to the Medicare Program
as of the date of this letter includes current accrued interest.
Interest is accrued monthly and is added to the balance of the debt.
Your check or money order for the amount due should be made payable to:

**30 - Interest Assessment/Payment on Overpayments and Underpayments**

**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

The CMS regulations, in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection
Act, as amended, the Social Security Act, and common law establish
specific rules for the payment of interest on Medicare overpayments and
underpayments (42 CFR 405.378). As a general rule, interest shall be
assessed at the prevailing rate specified by the Secretary of the
Treasury unless the overpayment is recouped or the underpayment is paid
within 30 days of a \"final determination.\"

Interest shall be assessed on overpayments, and shall be paid on
underpayments, to providers and suppliers of services (including
physicians and other practitioners), if the overpayment or the
underpayment is not liquidated within 30 days from the date of the final
determination.

The provisions of this section may not apply to FI overpayments or
underpayments determined as a result of interim rate and periodic
interim payment (PIP) adjustments (See Chapter 3, §60) or utilization
reviews.

The basic rules for assessing interest are:

**30.1 - Final Determination**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

For purposes of this chapter:

A final determination is deemed to occur upon final settlement of a cost
report when both an NPR and a written demand for payment of an
overpayment or a written determination of an underpayment is transmitted
to a provider based upon:

> •An audited final settlement;
>
> •Final settlement without audit; or
>
> •Reopening for any reason.

In cases in which an NPR is not used as a notice of determination, one
of the following determinations is issued:

> •A written determination that an overpayment exists and a written
> determination for payment;
>
> •A written determination of an underpayment;
>
> •An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) or hearing officer's decision that
> reduces the amount of an overpayment below the amount that CMS has
> already collected. A final determination is deemed to have occurred
> only when the amount of the overpayment/underpayment has been
> calculated. This may be at the decision time and it may be at a later
> time if recalculations are necessary.
>
> •A written determination that an As Filed Cost Report has been
> received without payment;
>
> •A written determination that an accelerated payment or advanced
> payment has occurred and has now been deemed an overpayment.

A final determination is deemed to occur upon the due date of a timely
filed cost report which indicates an overpayment is due CMS and is not
accompanied by payment in full.

A final determination is deemed to occur with respect to a cost report
that is not filed on time, from the date due until such time as the cost
report is filed.

**30.2 - Rates of Interest - FIs and Carriers**\
**(Rev. 30, 01-28-04)**

The interest rates on overpayments and underpayments is determined in
accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury
and is the higher of the private consumer rate or the current value of
funds rate prevailing on the date of final determination. Interest
accrues from the date of the initial request for refund and is assessed
for each 30-day period, or portion thereof, that payment is delayed
after the initial refund request.

The private consumer rate, historically higher than the current value of
funds rate, is subject to quarterly revision. The Department of the
Treasury certifies the revised rate to the Department of Health and
Human Services on a quarterly basis. Medicare contractors will be
receiving subsequent quarterly updates of the new interest rate for
Medicare overpayments and underpayments through a recurring update
notification.

Interest assessed for both late payments and installment payments is
computed as simple interest using a 360-day year. Simple interest is
interest that is paid on the original principal balance and after each
payment interest accrues on the remaining unpaid principal balance.
Interest charges will not be prorated on a daily basis for overdue
payments received during the month (e.g., 10, 15, or 20 days late).
Interest is assessed for the full 30-day period. The interest rate on
each of the final determinations will be the rate in effect on the date
the determination is made.

If periodic but unscheduled payments or credits are made in different
calendar quarters, the quarterly rate prevailing at the time of the
final determination is charged and remains the same until the debt is
liquidated.

Interest must be recalculated based on the outstanding balance at 30-day
intervals from the date of final determination.

The interest rate charged on overpayments repaid through an approved
extended repayment schedule is the rate that is in effect for the
quarter in which the determination was made. The rate remains constant
unless the provider defaults (i.e., misses two consecutive installment
payments) on an extended repayment agreement. When the provider defaults
on such an agreement, interest on the balance of the debt may be changed
to the prevailing rate in effect on the date of the default if that rate
is higher than the rate specified in the agreement.

**30.3 - Interest Accruals**\
**(Rev. 41, 04-30-04)**

**NOTE:** Effective October 1, 2004, 42 CFR 405.378 was amended to
change how interest is calculated on Medicare overpayments and
underpayments to providers, suppliers, and other health care entities.
This change also applies to Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) recoveries.
Under the new rule, interest is assessed for each full 30-day period
that payment is not made on time. This change applies to Medicare\
overpayments and underpayments determined (and MSP debts established) on
or after October 1, 2004 (the effective date of the final rule).
Unliquidated debts determined prior to October 1, 2004 will continue to
use the former interest calculation method (a period of less than 30
days is considered to be a full 30-day period) until paid in full.

Reminder: The date of the demand letter (not the day after) is the first
day of the first 30-day period.

**A. Accrual of Interest; Timely filed Cost Report/Part B Overpayment
Determination**

Interest will accrue from the date of the final determination and will
either be charged on the overpayment balance or paid on the underpayment
balance for each full 30-day period that complete liquidation is
delayed.

Generally, interest charges on an overpayment begin to accrue on the
date the FI issued an NPR and/or the date the FI or carrier issued a
notice of final determination of an overpayment, along with a written
demand for payment. If the overpayment is paid in full within 30 days
from the date of determination the interest accruals are normally
waived.

**NOTE:** The standard systems generally post interest on a monthly
basis. Interest is assessed at the end of 30-day periods. If the payment
is postmarked on or before the 30th day any interest accrual is waived
or zero-balanced in the system.

[Cost Report Overpayment-Example of Interest Accrual]{.underline}- The
provider with a FYE 08/31/04 submits a cost report on 01/28/05, showing
\$10,000 due the program, payment in full accompanies the cost report.
On 02/15/05, the intermediary completes the desk review and determines
an additional \$25,000 overpayment. On 02/15/05 the first demand letter
is sent. The provider does not pay the \$25,000 additional overpayment
until 04/03/05 (45 days after the date of the initial demand letter).
Interest, therefore, accrues on the \$25,000 for one full 30-day period.

[Physician/Supplier Overpayment-Example of Interest
Accrual]{.underline}- The carrier discovers that an overpayment for
\$795.45 exists and sends a demand letter on 12/01/04. The
physician/supplier does not remit payment on the overpayment until
01/15/05 (45 days after the date of the initial demand letter).
Therefore, interest accrues on the \$795.45 for one full 30-day period.

[Physician/Supplier Overpayment -- Example of Interest Accrual Prior to
10/01/2004]{.underline} --

The carrier discovers that an overpayment for \$795.45 exists and sends
a demand letter on 09/30/04. (The determination date of this overpayment
is prior to the effective date of the revision to 42 CFR 405.378). The
provider does not remit payment on the overpayment until 11/14/2004 (45
days after the date of the initial demand letter). Therefore, interest
accrues on the \$795.45 for two full 30-day periods.

[Example of Waiver of Interest- Overpayment Paid in Full within 30 days
from the date of determination]{.underline}- The FI/carrier determines
and demands an overpayment on 11/03/04 for \$1500.00. The provider
remits payment of \$1500.00. The postmark date on the payment is
11/30/04. Any interest accrual is waived since the overpayment was paid
in full within 30 days of the date of determination.

**B. Accrual of Interest; Untimely Filed Cost Reports, Regarding Final
Determinations at §30.1.**

Interest always accrues for any overpayment on a late filed cost report
for the period of delinquency when an overpayment is declared or
determined by CMS. The overpayment may appear on the cost report, or may
be determined later (including increases to overpayment, see example 2
below) through desk review or audit. Interest accrues during the period
a cost report remains unfiled beyond the due date. Interest is assessed
for the period of time the cost report was unfiled even if the
overpayment is satisfied at the time of the delayed filing of the cost
report. This interest assessment is due and payable following the notice
of a final determination. The interest rate will be the rate in effect
as of the day following the due date of the cost report.

On any subsequent determination that increases the overpayment on a cost
report filed untimely, the additional overpayment is also subject to
accrued interest charges for the period the cost report was due until
the date filed. The interest rate will be the rate in effect as of the
day following the due date of the cost report.

Where desk review, audit or reopening determinations increase the
originally filed and declared\
overpayment, the revised overpayment also is subject to the general
provisions governing interest on overpayments from the date of the new
or revised notice of final determination. These interest charges will be
in addition to the interest charges due for the period of time the cost
report remained unfiled.

**Examples of Application when cost report not filed on time**

1\. The provider submits its cost report 70 days late and pays the
declared overpayment of \$50,000 when filing. Interest at the prevailing
rate accrues from the due date until the date filed, or, in this case,
two 30-day periods as only two full 30-day periods have passed. Interest
is assessed during the period of delinquency whether or not payment
accompanies the cost report.

The intermediary performs a desk review and determines an additional
overpayment of \$12,000. Interest, at the prevailing rate at the time
the cost report became overdue is assessed on the \$12,000 for the two
30-day periods of delinquency. In addition, interest accrues at the
current prevailing rate on the \$12,000 if payment is not made within 30
days of the date of the initial demand letter.

2\. A provider with FYE 6/30/04 has a cost report that is due on
11/30/04. The cost report became overdue on 12/01/04. On 01/15/05 the
cost report was submitted indicating an amount due the program; payment
did not accompany the report. Due to the late submission of the cost
report, interest is assessed for one 30-day period. The interest rate
assessed is the rate in effect on the day the cost report became
overdue, 12/01/04.

In addition interest, at the rate in effect on the day the cost report
became overdue, will accrue on the declared overpayment from the date
the cost report is filed to the date the amount due is paid.

On 03/12/05, the intermediary completes a desk review and determines an
additional overpayment, issuing a NPR and demand letter. Interest will
be assessed on this additional amount at the rate in effect on 3/12/05.
In addition interest will be assessed for the period of delinquency at
the rate in effect on the day the cost report became overdue, 12/01/04.

**C. Accrual of Interest; Rejected Cost Report**

In terms of interest accrual, a rejected cost report is treated like an
unfiled cost report. If a cost report is officially rejected by the
contractor, (see Audit and Reimbursement section to determine when to
reject a cost report) interest accrues on the determined overpayment
amount from the date the cost report is due until the date the cost
report is resubmitted with payment in full. The determined overpayment
amount is the amount due the program on the accepted cost report. If a
cost report is submitted with payment in full and is later rejected the
accrual of interest depends on the determined overpayment amount on the
accepted cost report. If the determined overpayment amount on the
accepted cost report was paid in full by the original submission, no
interest accrues. If the determined overpayment amount is different than
the overpayment amount listed on the original rejected cost report,
interest will accrue on the difference.

**[Example of Interest Accrual When the Cost Report is
Rejected]{.underline}**

1\. A provider submits the cost report with payment in full before the
due date. Upon review the contractor rejects the cost report. The
provider corrects the cost report and resubmits it. The contractor
accepts the revised cost report. The amount due the program on the
revised cost report is equal to the check that accompanied the original
cost report. Since the check fulfilled the determined overpayment on/
before the due date, there is no interest accrual.

2\. A provider submits the cost report with payment in full before the
due date. Upon review the contractor rejects the cost report. The
provider corrects the cost report and resubmits it. The contractor
accepts the revised cost report. The amount due the program on the
revised cost report is different than the amount of the check that was
submitted with the original cost report. The provider sent in a check
for the additional amount with the revised cost report. Since the check
with the original cost report was not the determined

overpayment amount, interest accrues on the difference between the check
and the overpayment listed on the revised cost report. The interest rate
is the rate that was in effect on the day the cost report was due.

**[D. Underpayments]{.underline}**

Generally interest charges on an underpayment begin to accrue upon the
FI's or carrier's issuance of:

> •An NPR (FI only) and a notice of final determination of an
> underpayment under §30.1.
>
> •A notice of final determination of an underpayment under §30.1 when
> an NPR is not issued.
>
> •An administrative law judge (ALJ) or hearing officer's decision that
> reduces the amount of an overpayment below the amount that CMS has
> already collected. Interest begins to accrue once the underpayment
> amount has been determined. This may be at the decision time if the
> ALJ reverses the entire overpayment amount or the ALJ states a
> principal amount to be paid upon which interest may be calculated.
> However, if the ALJ does not specify the overpayment amount and
> recalculations are necessary (not including a full reversal of the
> overpayment amount) interest will begin to accrue at the time of the
> recalculations. If the FI/carrier is unsure when interest should
> accrue for a particular case, the servicing regional office should be
> contacted.
>
> •An Intermediary Hearing or a Provider Reimbursement Review Board
> (PRRB) decision that reduces the amount of an overpayment below the
> amount that CMS has already collected.

However, no interest will be due and payable to a provider if the FI or
carrier pays the underpayment within 30 days from the date of notice of
final determination of the underpayment. Interest will accrue each
30-day period on the underpayment balance that has not been satisfied.

**30.4 - Procedures for Applying Interest During Overpayment Recoupment
(Rev. 41, 04-30-04)**

**A. General**

If a provider is unable to satisfy the overpayment within 30 days from
the date of final determination and demand for repayment (§30.1),
interest accrues on the unpaid principal balance and is due and payable
for each full 30-day period that an overpayment balance is outstanding.
The contractor first applies any payments received to the accrued
interest charges and then to the overpayment principal. If the provider
has more than one overpayment outstanding and a payment is received, the
contractor credits the payment to the oldest overpayment first, unless
the provider designates otherwise.

**B. Recoupment Through Installment Payments**

A provider is expected to repay any overpayment as quickly as possible.
If a provider cannot refund the total amount of the overpayment within
30 days after receiving the first demand letter, it should immediately
request an extended repayment plan. (See Chapter 4, §50 for extended
repayment procedures.)

The interest rate to assess on overpayments repaid through an approved
extended repayment plan is the rate in effect for the quarter in which
the final determination is issued to the provider.

Interest rates remain constant based upon the initial rate assessed
unless the provider defaults, i.e., **misses two consecutive installment
payments** of an extended repayment agreement. Interest on the principal
balance of the debt may be changed to the current prevailing rate if (a)
the provider is delinquent on its installment payments and (b) the
current prevailing rate in effect on the date the installment becomes
overdue is higher than the rate specified in the agreement. (For FISS
and APASS users only.) Each payment

is applied first to accrued interest and then to principal. After each
payment interest will accrue on the remaining unpaid principal balance.

**C. Proof of Receipt**

The U.S. Postal Service postmark date is controlling in determining the
timely receipt of a cost report or payment of an overpayment. Therefore,
the contractor should retain all envelopes in order to have proof of
receipt. If a due date for any payment falls on a holiday or a weekend,
the next working day is considered the official due date for the purpose
of applying accrued interest. (FISS and APASS users only.) CMS does not
accept dates imprinted by a provider's meter postage machine as
confirmation of the postmark date. In these cases the FI/carrier should
use the date the cost report or payment was received and date stamped.
If a provider utilizes a commercial delivery service the date
constituting a timely receipt is the date the commercial delivery
service signs and accepts the package. The date the cost report or
payment is received by the FI/carrier controls if any other mailing
service was used.

**30.5 - Notification to Providers Regarding Interest Assessment (Rev.
41, 04-30-04)**

**A. Cost Report Reminder Letters**

The FI is required to issue reminder letters to a provider of the time
limitation for filing the cost report when the institutional provider
fails to file by the last day of the fourth month following the end of
the cost report period. In addition to the requirements outlined in
Chapter 3, §30 and Chapter 4, §20 the FI must include the following in a
cost report reminder letter:

1\. Late Filing Interest- If a cost report is not filed on time and
indicates an amount is due CMS, or if it is subsequently determined that
an additional overpayment exists, such as when an NPR is issued,
interest will be assessed on the overpayment from the due date of the
cost report to the date the cost report was filed. This interest
assessment is made regardless of whether the overpayment is liquidated
within 30 days.

2\. Assessed Interest- If a cost report is filed on time and indicates
an amount is due CMS, interest will accrue on that overpayment from the
date the cost report is due, unless full payment\
accompanies the report or the provider and the contractor agree in
writing, in advance, to recoup the amount of the overpayment from
interim payments over the next 30-day period.

**B. Notice of Program Reimbursement (NPR)**

In addition to the requirements outlined in audit instructions, all NPRs
issued after September 3, 1982, must include the following:

> \"In accordance with the procedures of 42 CFR 405.378ff interest will
> be assessed on the amount due CMS unless full payment is made within
> 30 days from the date of the Notice.
>
> Interest will be assessed for each full 30-day period that payment is
> delayed.\"

**C. Overpayment Demand Letters**

In addition to the requirements of Chapter 4, §20 and §90 the FI and
Carrier's written demand for repayment must contain a notice that in
accordance with 42 CFR 405.378, interest shall be assessed on all\
overpayments at the prevailing rate specified by the Secretary of the
Treasury unless repayment is made within 30 days. Interest shall be
assessed for each full 30-day period that payment is delayed and shall
accrue from the date of the final determination. The demand letter shall
include the appropriate interest rate that will be assessed if payment
in full is not received within 30 days.

**30.6 - Waiver and Adjustment of Interest Charges**

**(Rev. 41, 04-30-04)**

**A. Waiver of Interest Charges**

Interest charges shall be waived if the overpayment is completely
liquidated within 30 days from the date of final determination, or if
the contractor or the RO determines that the administrative cost of
collection would exceed the amount of interest.

For institutional providers serviced by FIs, interest shall not be
waived for the period of time during which the cost report was due but
remained unfiled as specified in Chapter 4, [§30.1]{.underline}. Also,
interest shall not be waived where a cost report is timely filed
indicating an amount due CMS and is not accompanied by payment in full
as specified in Chapter 4, [§30.1]{.underline} unless the provider and
the FI agree in advance to liquidate the overpayment through a reduction
in interim payments over the next 30-day period.

For bankrupt providers and interest see Chapter 3, §140.

**B. Adjustment of Interest Charges**

**1. Reopenings-FI**

When the FI reopens a final settlement pursuant to 42 CFR 405.1885 -
1887(a) and such reopening reverses some or all adjustments, whereby the
previous overpayment is reduced or eliminated, it makes an appropriate
adjustment to previously assessed and recovered interest to reflect the
proper interest chargeable under 42 CFR 405.378 and the policies set
forth.

Should the reopening action establish or increase an overpayment, the
rate of interest on the additional or new overpayment is the rate in
effect as of the date of the new notice of final determination.

If the original cost report was not submitted timely, any reopening
action, which results in an adjustment to the previously determined
overpayment, shall also include an appropriate adjustment to the late
filing interest assessment.

**2. FI and Provider Reimbursement Review Board Hearings - Institutional
Providers Serviced by FIs**

If an overpayment or underpayment determination is reversed
administratively by the FI or by the PRRB, and the reversal is the final
decision in the case, it is necessary to recalculate the correct amount
of interest to be assessed. If any excess interest or principal has been
collected, the FI refunds it to the debtor. No interest accrues on the
refunded amount unless payment is not made within 30 days from the date
of notification of the corrected overpayment or underpayment amount.

If the hearing results in an additional overpayment, the FI assesses
interest on the additional amount at the rate in effect on the date of
the revised final determination. **Interest does not accrue until the FI
notifies the provider of the revised overpayment or underpayment
amount.**

**Example of Application**\
On 07/18/05, the intermediary completes a final settlement and issues a
NPR and a written demand showing an amount due the program of \$16,000.
On 09/15/05, the provider pays the \$16,000 overpayment plus one 30-day
period of accrued interest.

As a result of a hearing on 12/l0/05, the PRRB reverses the
intermediary\'s findings and determines that the correct amount due the
program was \$4,000. The excess \$12,000 in principal and the accrued
interest on \$12000 that was assessed and collected must be returned to
the provider.

**3. Judicial Review**

The policies and procedures of this section do not apply to the time
period for which interest is payable under 42 CFR 413.64(j) because the
provider seeks judicial review of an adverse decision by the PRRB or the
decision of the Administrator. Section 1878(f) of the Social Security
Act authorizes a court to award interest in favor of the prevailing
party on any amount due as a result of the court's decision. The
interest is payable for the period beginning on the first day of the
first month following the 180-day period which began on either the date
the intermediary made a final determination or the date the intermediary
would have made a final determination had it been done on a timely
basis. The interest rate assessed is the rate on obligations issued for
purchase by the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. This rate of
interest can be found at If the FI withheld any portion of the amount in
controversy prior to the date the provider seeks judicial review by a
Federal court, and the Medicare program is the prevailing party,
interest is payable by the provider only on the amount not withheld.
Similarly, if the Medicare program seeks to recover amounts previously
paid to a provider, and the provider is the prevailing party, interest
on the amounts previously paid to a provider is not payable by the
Medicare program since that amount had been paid and is not due the
provider. However, if the Medicare program had recovered any of the
amount in controversy interest would be payable from the time of
recovery through the date of payment.)

**40 -- Withholds and Suspensions**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

In accordance with regulations (42 CFR §405.370), recoupment and
suspension are defined as:

Recoupment- The recovery by Medicare of any outstanding Medicare debt by
reducing present or future Medicare payments and applying the amount
withheld to the indebtedness.

Suspension of Payment- The withholding of payment by an intermediary or
carrier from a provider of an approved Medicare payment amount before a
determination of the amount of the overpayment exists.

**40.1 -- Recoupment by Withholding Payments (Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

**A. General**

In accordance with regulations (42 CFR §§405.371-372), payments
determined to be payable to providers can be withheld to protect the
Medicare program against financial loss if the intermediary has
determined that the provider to whom payments are to be made has been
overpaid.

The withholding of interim payments may be partial (for example, a
percentage of payments withheld or a set amount) or complete.

**B. Requirements for Withhold**

**C**omply with the following conditions to withhold interim payments:

> •Notify the provider in writing through the demand letter or in other
> correspondence of your intention to withhold payments, in whole or in
> part; and\
> •Give the provider an opportunity to submit a statement (including any
> evidence) as to why the withhold shall not be put into effect. Inform
> the provider it has l5 days following the date of the notification to
> submit such a statement.

**C. Cost Report Overpayments Percentage of Withhold**

Some percentage of withhold shall begin 15 days after the date of the
first demand letter (day 16) if the overpayment has not yet been
liquidated or an extended repayment plan has not been requested. The
matrix below shall be utilized to determine the percentage of withhold
for an overpayment determined from a cost

report that has been filed (as filed cost report, tentative settlement,
or final settlement), a PIP review, or an interim rate review. See
Chapter 3, §30.1 when a cost report remains unfiled.

**NOTE:** A set amount of withhold may be proposed instead of a
percentage. The amount shall not be less than the appropriate percentage
unless specific instructions are received from RO or CO.

**D. Physician/Supplier Overpayments- Withhold of Payments**

Withhold of all payments shall begin 40 days (41st day) after sending
the initial overpayment demand letter unless payment in full has been
received or an ERP application has been received. If an ERP application
has been received and is currently being reviewed by the Carrier or CMS
RO or CO and the first payment was

sent in by the provider with the application no withhold shall occur. If
the first payment did not accompany the ERP application a 30% withhold
shall be initiated.

**NOTE: Additional Information for Both FIs and Carriers**

If extenuating circumstances exist and the FI/carrier believe that a
higher or lower percentage of withhold is necessary to protect the
Medicare Trust Fund, the FI/carrier shall contact the servicing regional
office for guidance and/or approval. Some examples include knowledge
that the provider may file bankruptcy, a history of non-payment of
overpayments, or evidence that the withhold percentage would cause
irreparable harm.

The payment submitted with the ERP application shall be one month's
payment based on the amortization schedule submitted with the ERP
application. The amortization schedule shall not exceed 60 months, shall
include principal and interest and the minimum monthly payment shall not
be less than 1/60th of the overpayment. If the provider requests an ERP
in excess of 60 months the payment submitted shall be 1/60th of the
overpayment. If the payment submitted is not 1/60th of the overpayment,
the FI/carrier shall contact the provider (in writing or a documented
telephone call with the appropriate personnel at the provider's place of
business) requesting additional funds. If the provider does not submit
additional funds within 15 days of the date of the request, the
FI/carrier shall initiate a 30% withhold.

Until a final decision is made regarding the ERP the provider should
submit monthly payments based on the amortization schedule. If the
provider does not continue to submit monthly payments, the FI/carrier
shall contact the provider requesting the payment. If the provider does
not submit the monthly payment within 15 days of the date of the
request, the FI/carrier shall initiated a 30% withhold.

**E. Disposition of Withheld Funds**

All funds withheld shall be applied towards the outstanding overpayment.
The funds shall be applied to the outstanding interest first and then to
the outstanding principal balance.

**F. Duration of Withhold**

The withhold shall remain in effect until:

> •The overpayment is liquidated;
>
> •You enter into an agreement with the provider for liquidation of the
> overpayment; or
>
> •On the basis of subsequently acquired evidence, or otherwise, you
> determine that there is no overpayment.

**40.2 -- Suspension of Payment** (See Program Integrity Manual) **(Rev.
29, 01-02-04)**

Medicare authority to withhold payment in whole or in part for claims
otherwise determined to be payable is found in federal regulations at 42
CFR 405.370-377, which provides for the suspension of payments.

Suspension may be used when the contractor possesses reliable
information that:

> • Fraud or willful misrepresentation exists;
>
> • An overpayment exists but the amount of the overpayment is not yet
> determined;
>
> • The payments to be made may not be correct; or

• The provider fails to furnish records and other requested information.
(Some examples include cost reports, credit balance reports, and form
CMS-91.)

>
> **[Hardship]{.underline}** exists when the total amount of all

> approved, existing repayment schedule is 10 percent or greater than
> the total Medicare payments made for: (1) the cost reporting period
> covered by the most recently submitted cost report; or (2) the

> **[Extreme hardship]{.underline}** exists when a provider qualifies as
> being in "hardship" as defined in the previous paragraph and a 36
> month to 60 month extended repayment schedule (ERS) is deemed eligible
> for approval consideration by Medicare.
>
> **Additional Factors to Consider:**\
> The contractor shall evaluate the request, based on the definitions
> written above, in conjunction with the requirements found in sections
> 50-50.3 of this chapter. For a provider whose situation does not meet
> the definitions written above, the contractor shall evaluate the ERS
> request based on the requirements found in sections 50-50.3 of this
> chapter and consider the information in (i) -- (iii) below, when
> deciding whether to grant an ERS.
>
> The contractor shall determine the number, amount, and frequency of
> installment payments based on the information submitted by the debtor
> and on other factors such as:
>
> \(i\) Total amount of the claim (overpayment);\
> (ii) Provider\'s ability to pay; and\
> (iii) Cost to CMS of administering an installment agreement.
>
> The contractor shall document evaluation factors, including
> communication with CMS, used during the decision making process.
>
> A provider is expected to repay any overpayment promptly. If repaying
> an overpayment within 30 days would constitute a "hardship" on the
> provider, a request for an ERS should be submitted
> [immediately]{.underline}. However, if the overpayment is outstanding
> and not referred to Treasury, the provider shall request an ERS beyond
> 30 days, and the contractor shall review that request. Instructions on
> how to apply for an ERS shall be available on the contractors' website
> for provider reference. Medicare demand letters shall refer providers
> to the contractors' website for detailed ERS instructions. Contractors
> shall include in the ERS instructions a form in which the provider can
> elect to have their underpayments or manual refunds automatically
> applied to their overpayment (see section B below). Providers shall be
> given the option to request a paper copy.
>
> [A. The following steps shall be implemented upon receipt of an
> ERS]{.underline}:

*1.*A provider shall submit a signed ERS request which includes:

> *i.* the specific overpayment for which an ERS is being requested;\
> *ii.* the number of months requested;\
> *iii.* CMS required documents (see sections 50.1-50.2) and a good
> faith payment equaling one month's payment of the providers requested
> terms with its request (ex. 36 month request = 1/36th minimum).
>
> This is what constitutes a [complete]{.underline} ERS.

*2.*Contractors shall evaluate all providers' requests for an extended
repayment schedule up to 60 months, but shall only approve/disapprove
ERS requests of at least 12 months up to 36 months.

*3.*Contractors should consider ERS requests for 6-11 months on a
case-by-case basis. Approval should only be for cases where it is clear
that the debt can be repaid in this short period. Requests for 6 -11
month ERSs do not require submitting financial documentation if the
provider meets the hardship qualifications and does not fall within a
scenario found in section 50.3(1).

*4.*Contractors shall refer ERS requests over 36 months (or an ERS that
need RO guidance) that are determined as eligible to their CMS Regional
Office (RO), along [with a recommendation]{.underline}.

> Contractors should not send requests to the RO if they determine:
>
> *i.* that a provider's request over 36 months is ineligible for
> approval due to not meeting the hardship criteria; or
>
> *ii.* that the terms should be reduced less than 36 months, due to not
> meeting the extreme hardship criteria.

*5.*The RO shall evaluate and approve/disapprove ERS requests up to 60
months (see 42 CFR 401- 607(c)(2)(vi)).

*6.*CMS Central Office (CO) will evaluate ERS requests as needed or
requested by the RO.

*7.*All ERS requests shall be reviewed and evaluated for approval,
disapproval, or referral to RO/CO within 30 days of receipt of the
[complete]{.underline} request.

*8.*Providers shall request for a 6-11 month ERS without submitting
financial documentation if they meet the hardship qualifications and do
not fall within a scenario found in section 50.3(1).

*9.*The Provider shall submit financial documentation for ERS request 12
months or longer.

*10.*The contractor or RO shall determine eligibility qualifications and
the duration of the ERS based on its review of the provider's
documentation and any other information acquired (such as fraud
information, claims data, overpayment history, etc.).

*11.*If an ERS is approved and a provider misses one installment
payment, the provider is in default (refer to 42 CFR §401.613(2)(v)).
The payment is considered missed if not received within 30 days after
the payment due date. The contractor shall send a notice of default to
the provider within 5 business days, suspend the ERS agreement, and
immediately resume normal debt collection procedures.

*12.*The contractor shall consider a providers' request to reinstate the
ERS, even after default. If reinstated, the provider shall be required
to submit new documentation to determine eligibility. The contractor
shall determine to reinstate the original ERS agreement or revise the
schedule, if approved. If revised, the contractor shall ensure that the
revised terms do not extend the original

> and revised schedule beyond 60 months. The ERS will be closed with no
> reopening, if the provider were to default again on the reinstated
> request.
>
> *13.*The contractor should not grant an ERS to a provider where there
> is a previously defaulted ERS that was not resolved (reinstated, paid
> up to date, or paid in full).

B. The following steps shall be implemented when reviewing and
establishing an ERS:

> *1.*If a complete ERS request and a good faith check payment (see note
> a. below) are received, the contractor shall start reviewing the
> request immediately. The contractor shall accept the good faith
> payment(s) and suspend any recoupment during the review of the ERS.
>
> *2.*Contractors shall review the [complete]{.underline} ERS package to
> make a final decision within 30 business days of receipt. If the
> contractor needs additional time to review an ERS request, it shall
> work with their RO to determine a reasonable timeframe to complete.
>
> *3.*If an ERS request is received with all documentation but no good
> faith payment, (see note a. below) the contractor shall immediately
> place the provider on 30% recoupment during the review of the ERS.
>
> *4.*If an incomplete ERS request is received, the contractor shall
> review the submitted documentation, determine and request
> [all]{.underline} missing documents, and immediately place the
> provider on no less than 30% recoupment. If the contractor requests
> additional documentation and the information is not received by the
> 16th day after the letter date, the contractor should close the
> request and resume collect activities.
>
> *5.*Contractors shall review the ERS documents in detail to determine
> if there are any other documents needed. If additional documents are
> needed the contractors shall request additional documentation.
>
> *6.*Contractors should extend an additional 15 calendar days to
> receive the documentation from the provider before closing the
> request. Upon receipt, the contractor shall complete its review of the
> additional documentation within 5 business days.
>
> *7.*Contractors shall ensure that requesting additional documentation
> will not unnecessarily extend the decision-making period.
>
> *8.*If the contractor needs additional time to conduct the review,
> they shall work with their RO to determine a reasonable timeframe to
> complete.
>
> *9.*Contractors shall review and forward all ERS requests that they
> recommend to the RO for approval within 30 days of receiving a
> complete ERS request.
>
> *10.*Contractors shall **[NOT]{.underline}** refund any payments
> received or recouped that occurred while processing an ERS, but shall
> apply such amount(s) to the outstanding overpayment(s) (apply to
> interest first then principal), unless CMS directs otherwise.
>
> *11.*If the ERS request is approved, the contractor shall establish an
> ERS to recover the remaining balance of an overpayment.
>
> *12.*Pre-accrued interest shall be recovered first before applying any
> payments to principal. Pre-accrued interest can either be recovered in
> one lump sum or over multiple months (not to exceed 3 months, unless
> directed by CMS), depending on a provider's ability to pay in full or

>
> *13.*Contractors shall ensure that interest continues to accrue on the

>
> *14.*Once the pre-accrued interest is paid in full, the ERS
> (recovering principal and accruing interest) shall begin.
>
> *15.*Approved ERS requests will run from the ERS approval date.
>
> *16.*If the ERS request is denied, the contractor shall continue with

> denied.
>
> *17.*If both ERS requests are denied, any additional ERS requests for
> that overpayment (that a contractor deems should be considered) shall
> be forwarded to the RO for review.
>
> *18.*Contractors shall include in the ERS instructions an option in
> which the provider can elect to have all of its underpayments or
> manual refunds automatically applied to its overpayment. Subject to
> section B below, a provider can rescind its consent to automatic
> recoupment or offset of underpayments and manual refunds, with further

> *19.* Any underpayments or manual refunds applied to an overpayment

> 21\. If the contractor determines a Medicare underpayment or manual

25\. If a provider does not submit such a justification, the contractor
shall deny the request and shall immediately apply this amount to the
ERS payments.

**50.3 - ERS Approval Process**\
**(Rev. 312, Issued: 04-05-19, Effective: 10-01-19, Implementation

Contractors shall [not]{.underline} approve any ERS if any of the
following apply:

> 1\. When there is reason to suspect that the provider may:
>
> a\) the provider might file for bankruptcy;
>
> b\) cease to do business;\
> c) discontinue participation in the program; or when there is an
> indication of fraud or abuse committed against the program.
>
> 2\. When [any]{.underline} of the following is not submitted with
> request:
>
> a\) a signed request agreement;\
> b) [all]{.underline} required documents;\
> c) a proposed term and installment schedule; and the first installment
> payment (per the proposed installment schedule).

[\<12 month ERS]{.underline}

The contractor shall review and confirm that none of the scenarios
listed above apply. The contractor shall review 12 months of claims and
payment history, and consider whether it supports full payment of the
overpayment within \<12 months. Once the contractor determines ability
to repay, it shall examine the status of any outstanding overpayments,
cost report settlements, advanced payments and accelerated payments. In
the case any of these overpayments are excessive, in default or
delinquent, the contractor shall determine if an ERS for \<12 months is
appropriate.

[\> 12 month ERS]{.underline}

The contractor shall review and confirm that none of the scenarios
listed in the beginning of this section apply. The contractor shall
analyze the financial data submitted by the provider to determine the
availability of cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable,
restricted and unrestricted endowment funds, or special funds, and
considers whether these funds could be used for partial or full payment
of the overpayment (see Exhibits 1-4 below).

The contractor shall review 12 months of claims and payment history, and
considers whether it supports full payment of the overpayment within the
requested months. Once the contractor determines ability to repay, it
shall examine the status of any outstanding overpayments, cost report
settlements, advanced payments and accelerated payments. In the case any
of these overpayments are excessive, in default or delinquent, the
contractor shall determine if an ERS is appropriate. The contractor
shall reference and complete the ERS protocol sheet (see Exhibit 1)
while reviewing and once a decision is made.

The contractor should alter the length of time when approving an ERS
request, based on its analysis of the provider's submitted
documentation. For example, if a provider requests 24 months, but the
contractor determines that \>12 months is sufficient, the contractor can
deny the 24-month request and extend an offer of a 12-month repayment
plan. If the contractor recommends approval of an ERS that is over 36
months in length, it shall forward the recommendation to the RO for
approval within 30 days of receipt of the completed request.

The contractor should request additional financial information from the
provider, if needed. It should also request financial information from
the owner if the owner is requesting to submit personal capital to help
repay the Medicare debt.

The contractor shall provide a recommendation to the RO; shall deny or
approve for terms under its authority; or shall request additional
information from the provider within 30 days of receipt of the completed
ERS request.

If the provider is [unable]{.underline} to furnish all of the required
documentation listed in 50.1 and 50.2 of this chapter, a full
explanation shall be provided as to why this is the case. All
documentation shall be received within 30 days of the date of the
request (see § 50(2) of this chapter). Where the provider's explanation
is reasonable and the documentation is otherwise acceptable, the
contractor shall forward the request for extended repayment to the RO
with its recommendation, within 30 days receipt of the completed
request. The

contractor shall comply with Chapter 4 §40 regarding recouping the
overpayments pending receipt of the provider's documentation and the
contractor's decision on the extended repayment request.

If the provider is [able]{.underline} to furnish all of the required
documentation listed in 50.1 and 50.2 of this chapter timely, the
contractor shall forward the request for extended repayment to the RO
with its recommendation within 30 days receipt of the completed request.

Once the contractor completes the requirements for reviewing an ERS, it
shall make a decision regarding approval or referral to the RO.

If the contractor determines that the provider **[DOES]{.underline}**
meet the requirements for an ERS, it shall:

> a\) notify the provider in writing, within 5 business days of making
> the decision;\
> b) include the amortization schedule showing principal and interest
> payment amounts and dates payments are due; and\
> c) include approval information on the quarterly report (see § 50.4 of
> this chapter).

If the contractor determines that the provider **[DOES
NOT]{.underline}** meet the requirements for an ERS, it shall:

> a\) notify the provider in writing, within 5 business days of making
> the decision; b) include the denial reason, in the notification; and\
> c) include denial information on the quarterly report (see § 50.4 of
> this chapter).
>
> In the case the provider:
>
> [Rejects:]{.underline} If a provider rejects the approved terms, it
> shall submit a [written]{.underline} and [signed]{.underline}
> rejection notice to the contractor. In this case, the contractor shall
> close out the request and follow normal recoupment policy and
> procedure, at a recoupment rate of 100% of the provider's payments.
>
> [Disagrees:]{.underline} If a provider requests additional months due
> to hardship, the contractor shall elevate the request to the RO for
> further review. When needed, the RO should contact CO for additional
> guidance.
>
> [No Response:]{.underline} If the provider has not responded, the
> contractor shall proceed with the ERS as outlined in the approved
> schedule.

> 1\. Contractor shall summarize the major reasons why the overpayment
> occurred.
>
> 2\. Contractor shall review the documentation the provider submits to
> determine whether it is complete. (Refer to §50.1 and 50.2 for
> required documentation.) Contractor analyzes the financial data
> submitted (for an ERS over 12 months) to determine the availability of
> cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, restricted and
> unrestricted endowment funds, or special funds, and considers whether
> these funds could be used for partial or full payment of the
> overpayment.
>
> 3\. Contractor shall perform the following calculations by using the
> most current financial data that the provider submitted to determine
> whether the provider qualifies for an ERS.
>
> \(a\) Current Ratio\
> The current ratio relates the dollar value of current assets to the
> dollar value of current liabilities in order to evaluate an
> organization\'s ability to pay its current debt. Derived as:
>
> [CURRENT ASSETS\_\_\_\_\_\_\_]{.underline}\
> = CURRENT LIABILITIES
>
> This ratio defines the number of dollars held in current assets per
> dollar of current liabilities (e.g., it relates current assets to
> current liabilities). Multiple coverage of liabilities is desirable.
> Generally, high values for the current ratio imply a good ability to
> pay short-term obligations and, thus, a low probability of technical
> insolvency.
>
> Normally, the contractor considers a current ratio of 2:1 adequate to
> meet current liabilities. However, a provider with a current ratio of
> 2:1 or greater) can have short-term payment problems if its current
> assets are not expected to be in liquid form (cash or short-term
> investments) in time to meet the expected payment dates of the current
> liabilities.
>
> \(b\) Quick Ratio
>
> A liquidity ratio which measures the number of dollars of liquid
> assets (cash plus marketable securities plus accounts receivable)
> available per dollar of current liabilities. Derived as:
>
> [CASH + MARKETABLE SECURITIES + ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE]{.underline} =
> CURRENT LIABILITIES
>
> This is a more stringent measure of liquidity than the current ratio.
> The contractor uses it to determine the adequacy of cash, accounts
> receivable, and marketable securities to pay current liabilities.
>
> Normally, the contractor considers a quick ratio of 1.5:1 adequate to
> meet current liabilities. However, a provider with a high quick ratio
> can have short-term payment problems if it has excessive amounts of
> slow-paying or doubtful accounts receivable, which it cannot turn into
> cash soon enough to meet maturing current liabilities. Conversely, a
> low quick ratio might not imply a future liquidity crisis if current
> liabilities include terms that will not require payment from existing
> current assets.
>
> 4\. The contractor for institutional providers shall determine whether
> there are any settlements (interim rate adjustments or cost report) in
> process which could be used to offset the outstanding overpayment.
>
> 5\. Based upon the previous steps, the contractor shall summarize
> whether or not it should approve or deny, or recommend approval of a
> repayment plan. If it recommends approval, it indicates the number of
> months, how it calculated the monthly payment and the reason(s) for
> the approval. If it recommends denial, it indicates the reason(s).

**50.4 -- Sending the ERS Request to the Regional Office (RO)**

**(Rev. 312, Issued: 04-05-19, Effective: 10-01-19, Implementation
10-07-19)**

After the contractor has reviewed the provider's supporting
documentation and determines that a referral is needed or the request is
over 36 months, it shall send its recommendation to the RO for
consideration of approval. The contractor shall submit the following:

> 1\. A copy of all information the provider submitted.
>
> 2\. The date of the initial contact between the contractor and the
> provider regarding the overpayment.
>
> 3\. Copies of all correspondence, including demand letters and the
> complete ERS request. Also include notes of telephone conversations,
> if any.
>
> 4\. Part A - The amount of the overpayment; cost report year in which
> it occurred; dates and amounts of any repayments; dates and amounts of
> payments (interim or retroactive) held in account.
>
> 5\. Part B - The amount of the overpayment, claim paid date, dates and
> amounts of any repayment.
>
> 6\. Part A - The cost reports in which the overpayments appeared or
> were found. The contractor shall furnish any information it has on the
> financial status of related organizations, as determined through
> audits and other sources, such as mercantile reports.
>
> 7\. Documentation reflecting current enrollment status along with any
> bankruptcy, fraud and abuse and other litigation cases.
>
> 8\. Amount repaid to date on pending ERS request along with current
> status on any additional outstanding overpayments.
>
> 9\. The provider's proposed repayment plan and rationale.
>
> 10\. The contractor's recommendation and supporting rationale
> including a completed ERS protocol (See Exhibit 1) and the last 12
> months' claim and payment history.
>
> 11\. The contractor's opinion, based on experience, as to the
> reliability of the financial data.

The RO will grant a provider an ERS of:

> \(a\) 7 months up to 36 months if repaying an overpayment in full will
> constitute a "hardship," as defined in section 50 of this chapter.
>
> \(b\) 37 months up to 60 months if repaying an overpayment in full
> will constitute an "extreme hardship," as defined in section 50 of
> this chapter. See also 42 CFR 401-607(c)(2)(vi).

If the contractor receives no response from the RO in 30 days, the
contractor shall follow up with the RO for a status update.

> **[NOTE:]{.underline}** An ERS shall be repaid through recoupment,
> unless a provider supplies a valid reason why the ERS shall not be
> repaid through recoupment.

**50.6 - Requests from Terminated Providers or Debts that are Pending
Referral to Department of Treasury**\
**(Rev. 312, Issued: 04-05-19, Effective: 10-01-19, Implementation
10-07-19)**

When approving/denying an ERS request, the contractor is making a
subjective decision concerning the provider's ability to repay. All
complete ERS requests shall be reviewed by the contractor. This includes
ERS requests from terminated providers and requests received for debts
where the contractor has already sent an Intent to Refer (ITR) letter.

[Terminated Providers:]{.underline}

If a terminated provider submits an ERS request, the MAC shall consider
the provider's ability to repay the debt over time.

The contractor shall refer requests to the RO if it determines that an
ERS is in the best interest of the Medicare program; prior to denying
the request based on the requirements in section 50.3. In addition, if
the contractor has a reason to believe that the provider will terminate
the program, they should research this issue and refer the request to
the RO for a decision.

[Debts that are Pending Referral to Department of Treasury:]{.underline}

If a contractor has sent an ITR letter and the contractor has approved
an ERS prior to referral, the debt shall not be referred to Treasury. It
is preferred to recoup payments from present and future claims payments.
If recoupment of payments is not possible, the contractor shall accept
monthly checks in the full amount agreed. If the provider misses one
payment (31 days past due), the contractor shall continue with normal
debt collection (including discontinuing the ERS, pursuing the full
balance owed, and/or referral to Treasury).

If denying an ERS request will result in the immediate referral of an
[active]{.underline} provider to the Department of Treasury, the
contractor shall contact the RO to determine if an alternative exists.

**[NOTE:]{.underline}** The requirements set forth in the Debt
Collection Improvement Act of 1996 still apply.

**60 - Withholding the Federal Share of Payments to Recover Medicare or
Medicaid Overpayments**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

Institutions and persons furnish health care services under both the
Medicare and Medicaid programs, and are reimbursed according to the
rules applicable to each program. Overpayments may occur in either
program; at times resulting in a situation where an institution or
person that provides services owes a repayment to one program while
being reimbursed from the other.

**60.1 - Withholding the Federal Share of Medicaid Payments to Recover
Medicare Overpayments**\
**(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

Section 1914 of title XIX and 42 CFR §447.30 provide for CMS to withhold
the Federal share of Medicaid payments with respect to Medicaid
providers that have, or previously had, a Medicare provider agreement
under §1866, and for physicians when:

> •They have received an overpayment of title XVIII funds, and efforts
> to collect it have been unsuccessful; or
>
> •Efforts to secure from the provider, the necessary data and
> information to determine the amount, if any, of the overpayment have
> been unsuccessful (i.e., a deemed overpayment because the provider
> failed to file a cost report); and
>
> •For physicians or suppliers, they have previously accepted Medicare
> payment on the basis of an assignment under section 1842(b)(3)(B)(ii)
> of the Act, and during the 12 month period preceding the quarter in
> which CMS proposes to withhold the Federal share of Medicaid payments
> for a Medicare overpayment, submitted no claims under Medicare or
> submitted claims which total less than the amount of the overpayment.

The CMS may order the State to withhold the Federal share of Medicaid
payments of a provider to recover Medicare overpayments plus accrued
interest.

The FI/carrier shall establish whether or not a provider is subject to
these procedures. The FI/carrier must be sure the provider is
participating in title XIX program prior to referring the case to the RO
for withholding. It shall refer only those cases that it is unable to
collect through established procedures. The RO resolves questions with
respect to the provider\'s status in the Medicaid program.

Section 1914(a) of the Act permits, rather than requires, the Secretary
to withhold the Federal share of Medicaid payments to recover Medicare
overpayments. To allow flexibility in the administration of this
provision, the ROs routinely determine whether it would be cost
effective to withhold the Federal share. If they determine that it is
not feasible, they notify the FI/carrier, citing the reason for not
processing the collection request.

The provider may appeal the FI/carrier's overpayment determination. The
appeal procedures, however, do not delay the withholding of the Federal
share of payments due the Medicaid provider or physician.

If a provider is subject to the procedures for withholding the Federal
share of Medicaid payments to recover the Medicare overpayment and it
has not met the conditions in the second demand letter, the FI/carrier
shall contact the RO with a recommendation to initiate withholding
action.

If the RO determines that withholding the provider's federal share of
Medicaid payments would be cost effective, the RO may request copies of
the case file, which may include cost reports, demand letters, and
copies of all correspondence and contact with the provider.

To implement the withholding action, the RO notifies the provider and
the State Agency (SA) responsible for the State\'s title XIX
expenditures. The withholding of Federal payments under title XIX
remains in effect until notice is received by the title XIX SA through
the RO that:

> •The overpayment has been refunded,\
> •Satisfactory arrangements have been made for repayment, or\
> •There is no overpayment based upon new evidence or a subsequent
> audit.

When the withholding of Federal payments under title XIX is no longer
necessary, it will be lifted and the provider again receives Federal
title XIX payments for Medicaid services rendered.

The FI/carrier shall notify the RO immediately if the provider submits
an acceptable cost report or makes satisfactory arrangements for the
repayment of the overpayment. It includes the date the delinquent cost
report was filed or satisfactory arrangements for the repayment were
made. Because the withholding process is a lengthy one, the RO may
revoke a withholding before its effective date if the provider submits a
satisfactory cost report or if it makes satisfactory arrangements for
repayment.

The RO monitors the collection and advises the FI/carrier when the
overpayment is recovered. If an excess amount is withheld, it advises
the FI/carrier to restore any excess.

**60.2 - Withholding Medicare Payments to Recover Medicaid Overpayments
(Rev. 29, 01-02-04)**

Section 1885 of title XVIII of the Act and 42 CFR §405.375 provide for
CMS to withhold Medicare payments under both Part A and B to recover
Medicaid overpayments that a Medicaid agency has been unable to collect.

The RO determines if withholding the Medicare payments due the overpaid
Medicaid institution is appropriate. Where it determines that
withholding the Medicare payments is proper, it advises the FI/carrier
to withhold the Medicare payments to the institution by the lesser of:

> • The amount of the Medicare payments to which the institution would
> otherwise be entitled;
>
> • The total Medicaid overpayment.

The FI/carrier shall terminate the withholding action if the Medicaid
overpayment is recovered or the RO advises it to do so.

It shall submit to the RO, at least monthly until the overpayment is
recovered, the amount of Medicare payments withheld. If no claims are
received in any month, it informs the RO that no payments were withheld.

The Medicaid agency establishes procedures to assure the return to the
institution or person amounts withheld that are ultimately determined to
be in excess of the Medicaid overpayments. The FI/carrier shall
establish internal procedures to account for the Medicare amounts
withheld under this section.

**70 - Non-Medicare Secondary Payer (Non-MSP) Debt Referral Instructions
and Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA) Activities**\
**(Rev. 77, Issued: 09-16-05, Effective: 10-17-05, Implementation:
10-17-05)**

(MSP Debt Referral Instructions are contained in the Medicare Secondary
Payer Manual, Publication 100-05, Chapter 5, Section 60.)

**70.1 - Background**\
**(Rev. 77, Issued: 09-16-05, Effective: 10-17-05, Implementation:
10-17-05)**

The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA) facilitates
collections by the Federal Government and encourages the streamlining of
procedures within and among Federal agencies. The DCIA requires Federal
agencies to refer eligible delinquent debt to the Department of Treasury
(Treasury) or a Treasury designated Debt Collection Center (DCC) for
cross servicing and/or offset through the Treasury Offset Program (TOP).

**70.2 - Cross Servicing**\
**(Rev. 77, Issued: 09-16-05, Effective: 10-17-05, Implementation:
10-17-05)**

Cross servicing is a process whereby Federal agencies refer eligible
delinquent debt to Treasury for collection. The agency referring the
debt retains responsibility for reporting the debt on the Treasury
Report on Receivables Due from the Public. The agency is also
responsible for removing accounts from its receivables when Treasury
directs it to write off the debt. To effectively collect the debt that
agencies refer, Treasury issues demand letters, conducts telephone
follow-up, initiates skip tracing, refers debt for administrative
offset, and refers debt to a private collection agency (PCA). Other
collection tools may include Federal salary offset and administrative
wage garnishment. The PCA shall attempt collection of the debt, using
collection tools such as skip tracing, credit report search, demand
letters and telephone calls.

**70.3 - Treasury Offset Program (TOP)**\
**(Rev. 136; Issued: 02-15-08; Effective/Implementation Date:
03-17-08)**

The TOP is a program that compares Federal payments and eligible state
payments with Federal debt.

When a match occurs, the payment is offset to collect the debt. When the
Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and name of the debtor match the
TIN and name of a payee, the payment to the payee is offset and monies
that would have gone to the payee are sent to the creditor agency to
satisfy the debt. A

debt may remain in TOP for offset up to ten years from date of
determination. Types of payments that can be offset may include tax
refunds, vendor payments, benefit payments with certain restrictions,
and eligible state payments.

**70.4 Definition of Delinquent Debt**\
**(Rev. 77, Issued: 09-16-05, Effective: 10-17-05, Implementation:
10-17-05)**

Per DCIA referral criteria, "delinquent" is defined as debt: (1) that
has not been paid (in full) by the date specified in the agency's
initial written notification (i.e., the agency's first demand letter),
unless other payment arrangements have been made, or (2) that at any
time thereafter the debtor defaults on a repayment agreement.

**70.5 - Referral Requirements**\
**(Rev. 259, Issued: 01-15-16 Effective: 02-16-16, Implementation:
02-16-16)**

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is mandated to refer
all eligible debt, 120 days delinquent, for cross servicing and/or TOP.
Additionally, the CMS has the option of referring such debt before it is
120 days delinquent.

**70.6 - Debt Ineligible for Referral *(Rev. 11787; Issued:01-19-23;
Effective: 04-21-23; Implementation:04-21-23)***

Non-MSP debt ineligible for referral include those: (1) in bankruptcy
status, (2) in an appeal status (pending at any level), (3) at the
Department of Justice, (4)where the debtor is deceased,\
(5) Federal entity debt where the debtor is a Federal agency, (6) where
the principal and interest balance is less than \$25, or (7) debt under
fraud and abuse investigation where the investigating unit has provided
the contractor with specific instructions not to attempt collection.

Treasury has also approved a waiver for the mandatory referral of
unfiled cost report debt for cross servicing and/or TOP and for debts
less than \$100 that do not have a TIN.

*C*ontractors shall monitor debt previously ineligible for referral that
become eligible for referral. If the status of the debt changes to an
eligible status, contractors shall determine whether an ITR letter has
been sent. If the ITR letter has been sent, and at least 60 days have
passed since the date of the ITR letter (including the ITR letter
returned undeliverable), contractors *not utilizing HIGLAS* shall
*refer* the debt *by utilizing the Debt Referral Form* within ten
calendar days of the status change making the debt eligible for
referral. If the ITR letter has not been sent, contractors shall send
the ITR letter within ten calendar days of the status change making the
debt eligible for referral, and follow the normal debt referral process.

**70.7 - Intent to Refer Letter *(Rev.11787; Issued: 01-19-23;
Effective: 04-21-23; Implementation: 04-21-23)***

To comply with the DCIA requirements to provide specific notice to
debtors before referring a debt for cross servicing and/or TOP,
contractors shall send an Intent to Refer (ITR) letter as their final
demand

letter for all eligible delinquent debt. *The contractor shall send the
"final demand letter", which is defined as the last letter routinely
sent to debtors to request payment, when or before the debt is 30 to 61
days delinquent (60 to 91 days from the determination date).*A sample
ITR letter is included in Exhibit 1 of this section.

The ITR letter shall be sent regardless of previous collections on the
debt, unless there is an approved current extended repayment agreement
in effect.

When appropriate, the ITR letter shall include the amount of interest
due, along with the date of the last interest accrual. contractors may
add additional wording to this letter that shall provide additional
instructions or clarification regarding the recoupment of the
overpayment.

Contractors *sending manual ITR letters*should use their own language in
the opening paragraphs to explain the reason for the overpayment and the
current balance, including interest accrued and the interest rate.

The ITR letter shall be signed by the contractor official who routinely
signs the demand letters.

The language in the ITR letter shall include a sentence that says: "If,
after sixty calendar days from the date of this letter we have not
received such evidence, your debt, if it is still outstanding\
and eligible for referral, shall be referred to the Department of
Treasury or its designated Debt Collection Center for cross
servicing/offset."

**70.8 - Response to Intent to Refer Letter *(Rev. 11787;
Issued:01-19-23; Effective: 04-21-23; Implementation:04-21-23)***

*C*ontractors shall respond to any inquiries received as a result of the
ITR letter within 15 calendar days of receipt. If the status of the debt
changes based on the communications with the debtor, contractors shall
update all appropriate systems timely.

The ITR letter provides debtors with 60 calendar days to respond. If, by
day 61 the debtor has not responded *to the ITR letter*, *the
contractornot utilizing HIGLAS* shall *refer* the debt *immediatelyby
using the Debt Referral Form*. *For contractors utilizing HIGLAS, the
debt will be systematically referred to Treasury 66 days from the ITR
letter date.*Debt for which less than full payment was received, or
there is a current repayment agreement that is in default, are eligible
for referral for cross servicing and/or TOP.

Where there has been a partial recoupment or collection, but the
collection is not the result of a current extended repayment agreement,
the balance (if principal and interest balance is greater than or equal
to \$25) shall still be referred for cross servicing and/or TOP. *The
contractor shall not refer debts to Treasury that are ineligible for
referral or exempt from referral to cross servicing and/or TOP.*

Before *referring* a debt for cross servicing, contractors shall first
determine if the debt should be referred to the Regional Office (RO) for
litigation rather than referral to Treasury for cross servicing. If it
is determined that the debt should be litigated, contact the RO for
further action.

If the ITR letter is returned as undeliverable, contractors shall follow
established procedures to locate a better address. (See Chapter 4, §§ 10
and 80) If a better address is obtained, the contractor shall send the
provider/supplier a manual ITR notification letter, with the original
ITR letter attached, to the better address. The original ITR letter date
shall remain in effect. If the ITR letter is returned as undeliverable
and a better address cannot be located *within 10 business days:*

> •*the contractor* not utilizing HIGLAS shall *refer* the debt *to
> Treasuryby entering the debt into the* *Debt Referral Form*60 calendar
> days *from the date*of the original letter.
>
> •*the contractor utilizing HIGLAS shall update the status code to

**70.11 - Actions Subsequent to *Debt Referral (Rev. 11787;
Issued:01-19-23; Effective: 04-21-23; Implementation:04-21-23)***

Once the debt is referred for cross servicing, active collection efforts
by the contractors and/or CMS shall cease. However, debt referred for
cross servicing and/or TOP shall still be maintained in *HIGLAS or*in
the contractors' internal systems for financial reporting, interest
accrual, and possible internal\
recoupment. *The contractornot utilizing HIGLAS*shall be responsible for
updating all the applicable systems. The *contractor shallutilize* the
*Debt Referral Form*for the *manual* change of the status and the
balance of the debt *at Treasury*.

**70.12 - Transmission of Debt**

***(Rev. 11787; Issued:01-19-23; Effective: 04-21-23;
Implementation:04-21-23)***

*Prior to the weekly transmission of debts to Treasury, the contractor
shall certify its debts by the close of business on the day before
transmission.*When CMS transmits debts *to Treasury*, CMS shall generate
*an CMS Debt Management (CMSDM) Outbound Debt Referral R*eport *that
will list the*debt*s* transmitted that week. *The contractor utilizing
HIGLAS shall use the appropriate responsibility to retrieve the report
that will list its debts only. The contractor not utilizing HIGLAS shall
update its internal systems with the debts' transmission status and send
a transmitted debt report to CMS with 15 business days.* The contractors
shall review the report*s* to ensure that debts transmitted remain valid
and amounts are accurate.

**70.13 - Update after *Debt* Transmission *(Rev.11787; Issued:01-19-23;
Effective: 04-21-23; Implementation:04-21-23)***

Once a debt has been referred for cross servicing and/or TOP:

*The contractors shall update HIGLAS or the Debt Referral Form
(contractors not utilizing HIGLAS), within ten business days of the
notification of the change to the debt if the contractors discover an
error, collection (by check or recoupment), or receive information
establishing that the debt is ineligible for cross servicing (i.e.,
bankruptcy, appeal),*

If Treasury or a *Private Collection Agency(*PCA*)* discovers an error,
collects on the debt, or receives information, that would render the
debt ineligible for cross servicing, Treasury shall notify *CMS and its
contractors via the CMS Debt (CMSDM) Management Inbound Acknowledgment,
Treasury Dispute Timer, or Collections Report.* The *contractornot
utilizing HIGLASshall updateits* internal records, as

appropriate. The *contractor shall return the completed CMSDM* Treasury
Dispute *TimerReports* to CMS within *30 calendar days*.

If Treasury or the PCA receives a dispute from the debtor or obtains
additional information regarding the debt that requires CMS or
contractor intervention, a Treasury Cross-Servicing Dispute Resolution
Form shall be sent to CMS. The CMS shall maintain a report of all debt
in dispute and forward the information to the contractors for review and
decision. The contractors shall have 30 calendar days to respond to
Treasury and update their internal systems if applicable, and shall copy
CMS RO and CO on their response. *The contractor shall recall the debt
if it is determined that the dispute is valid.*

If Treasury does not receive the response to the dispute timely, the
debt may be returned to agency (RTA) with the reason "dispute timer
expired."

**70.14 - Collections**\
**(Rev. 136; Issued: 02-15-08; Effective/Implementation Date:
03-17-08)**

**70.14.1 -- Background *(Rev. 11787; Issued:01-19-23; Effective:
04-21-23; Implementation:04-21-23)***

*Collection reports* from the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) as a
result of cross servicing efforts are received by CMS central office
(CO) through the Intra-governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC) system
*multiple times per month*. Collections may be received as a result of
collection efforts by Treasury's Servicing Center or by a Treasury
contracted Private Collection Agency (PCA) including installment
payments on Treasury approved extended repayment schedules or from
offsets from the TOP.

**70.14.2 - Intra-governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC) System
*(Rev. 11787; Issued:01-19-23; Effective: 04-21-23;
Implementation:04-21-23)***

*The collection report generated from the IPAC system includes a break
out of principal and interest collected on individual debts; however,
the report does not show the balance and the status of the debt after
the collection. Treasury calculates interest on a daily basis while CMS
calculates interest monthly. Therefore, the amount of interest collected
by Treasury or its PCAs may not equal the amount of interest shown as
accrued by the contractors.*

**70.14.3 - *CMS Debt Management Collections Interface and Report(Rev.
11787; Issued:01-19-23; Effective: 04-21-23; Implementation:04-21-23)***

*The CMS Debt Management (CMSDM) Collections Interface reports
collections back to HIGLAS on debts that were referred to Treasury. The
contractor shall view its Roundtrip Status Report every Monday to
determine if the CMSDM Treasury Collections Report is available from the
Friday HIGLAS cycle. The contractor shall use the appropriate HIGLAS
responsibilityto generate the CMSDM Treasury Collections Report which is
the result of processing the interface and is available three times per
month.*

*For each debt listed on the CMSDM Treasury Collections Report,
contractors not utilizing HIGLAS shall apply the collection to principal
and interest amounts as indicated. For collection of interest only,
contractors not utilizing HIGLAS shall post the interest as shown on the
CMSDM Treasury Collections Report. An interest adjustment is not
required prior to posting the collection. For collection of principal
and interest, contractors not utilizing HIGLAS shall manually adjust the
amount of interest accrued in its internal system to the amount of
interest collected as listed on the CMSDM Treasury Collections Report.*

*This will make the amount of the accrued interest equal to the amount
of interest collected which is listed on the CMSDM Treasury Collections
Report. Contractors not utilizing HIGLAS shall then post the collection.
Interest shall continue to accrue on the remaining principal balance.
Contractors not utilizing HIGLAS shall use the current date as the date
of collection to post the Treasury collections to their systems.
Contractors not utilizing HIGLAS shall complete and return to CMS the
CMSDM Treasury Collections Report within 15 business days of receipt.*

*Contractors utilizing HIGLAS shall complete/update their
adjustments/refunds within 15 business days of receipt of the CMSDM
Treasury Collections Report. CMS shall run a CMSDM Treasury Collections
Report on day 16 to determine if there are any unapplied debts. If there
are any unapplied debts CMS shall create a report listing those debts
and send to the MAC via email. The contractor shall take immediate
corrective action and send an Excel spreadsheet back to CMS showing the
updates. If a refund is not resolved, the contractor shall have an
additional 15 business days to resolve the refund.*

**70.14.4 - *Reserved for Future Use***

**70.14.5 - *Reserved for Future Use***

**70.14.7 - Excess Collections *(Rev. 11787; Issued:01-19-23; Effective:
04-21-23; Implementation:04-21-23)***

Amounts collected may exceed the amount of the debt that was referred
for cross servicing/TOP. As an example, an excess collection may result

(either active or passive) to try to collect the debt.*

*Contractors shall submit the following debts for close-out (termination
of collection action).*

> •*Non-MSP provider/supplier debts with a combined principal and

>
> • *MSP debt where the debtor is deceased. The contractor shall not
> close-out these debts when the* *debtor is deceased and the estate is

*checks shall be performed through CPI's Unified Case Management (UCM)
system for providers/suppliers that have an NPI.*

*The contractor shall use the following instructions for requesting
fraud check reports.*

> *1.The contractor shall create an Excel spreadsheet listing the NPIs
> and names of the*\
> *providers/suppliers. The NPIs and provider/supplier names shall be
> obtained from the related debt close-out spreadsheet. The contractor
> shall use the naming format
> FraudChk_Contractor-Jurisdiction_Reviewer_Period Ending (example --
> FraudChk_ABC-J2_RO_FY19Q4) when naming/saving the file(s).*
>
> *2.The contractor shall email its fraud check request spreadsheet

> CPIFraudcheck-OFMDebt@cms.hhs.gov with the subject line*\
> *"Contractor/Jurisdiction Fraud Check Request" (example -- ABC/J2
> Fraud Check Request). 3.The contractor shall expect to receive the
> fraud check report from CPI within one week of sending* *the fraud

> note the following:*
>
> •*The NPI is listed in column A (PRVDR_NPI_NUM).*
>
> •*Column B (UCM_FRAUD_CHECK) will indicate a "Y" if the NPI was found
> in UCM. An "N" in column B will indicate that there are no records
> listed for the NPI. Therefore, all other fields will be blank.*
>
> •*If there is a "Y" in column B, proceed to column P (RFRL_OPEN_IND)
> to determine if the case is open or closed. If there is a "Y", the
> case is open which means that the*\
> *provider's/supplier's debts are not eligible for close-out. An "N"
> indicates that the provider's/supplier's fraud case is closed.*
>
> •*If there are more than one open and/or closed fraud case for a given
> provider/supplier, filter column P with the "Ys" only to get only
> those providers/suppliers with open fraud cases. If all entries for a
> given NPI have an "N" in columns B or P, then the debt is eligible for
> RO or CO close-out review/approval. However, if one or more of a given
> provider/supplier NPI's entries has a "Y" in column P, the NPI\'s
> debts are not eligible to be submitted for RO or CO close-out
> review/approval.*

*The contractor shall include a copy of the fraud check report for the
NPIs that are included on the particular debt close-out spreadsheet that
is sent to the CO or RO.*

Treasury.

**70.17.2 - Debts RTA by Treasury as Uncollectible (RU) or Out of
Business (RN) *(Rev. 11787; Issued:01-19-23; Effective: 04-21-23;
Implementation:04-21-23)***

*The temporary HIGLAS RTA Status Code for all debts that are returned to
agency as Uncollectible (RU) or Out of Business (RN) shall be
systematically updated, by HIGLAS, to 'DR-RTN-CS' (Debt Returned from
Cross-Servicing).*

*For RU and RN debts with a combined principal and interest balance less
than \$25:*

> •*Contractors utilizing HIGLAS shall allow the HIGLAS Auto Write-Off
> Program to identify these* *debts and systematically write them off.*
>
> •*Contractors not utilizing HIGLAS shall submit for close-out review.*

The contractors shall use the RTA report to research the *RU or RN*debts
*with a combined principal and interest balance greater thanor equal
to\$25* in order to determine the current status or final disposition.

The debts already in a recalled status are included so that the
contractors will know that Treasury considers the debts uncollectible or
out of business.

The contractors shall determine whether collection by litigation is a
viable option for debts *with a combined principal and interest balance
greater thanor equal to \$25*showing a status code of RU or RN. If so,
follow established procedures for referring the debts for litigation
(See CMS Pub. 100-06, chapter 3, section 120).

The contractors shall also consider whether all other appropriate
actions to collect debts *with a combined principal and interest balance
greater thanor equal to\$25*have been taken before recommending debts
for Write-Off Closed (WOC), including the criteria listed below*:*

> 1\. Have there been any collections or payments on this debt in the
> last year? If so, and the contractor believes further collections are
> possible, the contractor shall not recommend the debt for WOC, but
> shall continue collection efforts for MSP and Non-MSP debts.
>
> 2\. Has the debtor submitted any Medicare claims in the last 6 months?
> If so, and the contractor believes further collections are possible,
> the contractor shall not recommend the debt for WOC, but shall
> continue collections efforts.
>
> 3\. Is the debtor receiving Medicaid funds? If so, the contractor
> shall not recommend the debt for WOC. The contractor shall instead
> contact the CMS RO to institute an offset, and shall continue
> collection efforts.
>
> 4\. If applicable, did the debtor undergo a Change of Ownership (CHOW)
> (a new owner who opts to receive automatic assignment of the old
> owner's provider/supplier agreement)?

If so, the contractor shall determine if collection efforts were pursued
from the new owner.

> \(a\) If so, the contractor shall recommend for WOC\
> (b) If not, the contractor shall follow the normal policies and
> procedures for debts collection.
>
> 5\. If applicable, did the debtor file any cost reports that the
> contractor has not yet settled?
>
> If so, the contractor shall not recommend the debt for WOC. Instead,
> the contractor shall await settlement of the cost report to determine
> whether it results in an underpayment. If it does result in an

>
> 6\. If applicable, does the debtor have any outstanding unfiled cost

>
> If so, the contractor shall not recommend the debt for WOC. Instead,

> funds in suspense to recover the debt or any other outstanding debts
> for the provider/supplier.
>
> 8\. If applicable, does the debtor have any claims or cost reports
> subject to re-opening?
>
> If so, the contractor shall not recommend the debt for WOC. Instead,
> the contractor shall wait until the expiration of the reopening

>
> 9\. Does the debtor have any open appeal(s)? If so, the contractor
> shall not recommend the debt for WOC. Instead, the contractor shall

> that has the open fraud case.

If the contractors have considered all of the above criteria above and
are recommending the debts for WOC, the contractors shall submit a
request to the CMS RO for approval. The contractor shall submit these
*debts as instructed inChapter 4, § 70.16.The contractor shall include

shall remain open until the criteria for WOC has been met. The
contractors shall report these debts on the appropriate line of the CMS
Forms 751 or the Treasury Report on Receivables (TROR) to indicate
Treasury has RTA the debts but the WOC process has not been completed.

If it is determined a refund is valid, the contractors shall follow
procedures for applying excess collections and update *HIGLAS or*their
internal systems to reflect any refund given (see CMS Pub. 100-06,
chapter 4, section 70.14.*8*).

**Exhibit 1-Intent to Refer (ITR) Letter**\
**(Rev. 294, Issued: 10-06-17, Effective: 07-03-17, Implementation:
07-03-17)**

**Intent to Refer Letter [Background]{.underline}**

The DCIA requires Federal agencies to refer debt that is 120 days
delinquent to the Department of Treasury or a Treasury designated Debt
Collection Center for cross servicing.

Prior to debt transfer, the DCIA requires agencies to inform the debtor
of the agency's intent to refer the debt, and to provide debtor
information regarding the referral process.

Attached are specific paragraphs that explain the process and debtor
rights. These paragraphs shall be included in the intent to refer letter
sent to the debtor.

Medicare contractors should use their own language in the opening
paragraphs to explain the reason for the overpayment and the current
balance, including interest accrued and the interest rate.

Subject in Bold: **Notice of Intent to Refer Debt to the Department of
Treasury's Debt Collection Center for Cross Servicing and Offset of
Federal Payments and Certain Eligible State Payments**

Contractor opening paragraphs concerning the reason for the overpayment,
date of determination and amount due. May refer to previous demand
letters or other forms of contact regarding the debt.

Your debt to the Medicare Program is delinquent and, by this letter, we
are providing notice that your debt will be referred to the Department
of Treasury's Debt Collection Center (DCC) for Cross Servicing and
Offset of Federal Payments. Your debt will be referred under provisions
of Federal law, title 31 of the United States Code, Section 3720A and
the authority of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996.

The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA) requires Federal
agencies to refer delinquent debts to the Department of Treasury and/or
a designated Debt Collection Center (DCC) for collection through cross
servicing and/or the Treasury Offset Program. Under the offset program,
delinquent Federal debts are collected through offset of other Federal
agency payments you may be entitled to, including the offset of your
income tax return through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The TOP
offsets can also be taken from eligible state payments to which you are
entitled.

The Debt Collection Center will use various tools to collect the debt,
including offset, demand letters, phone calls, referral to a private
collection agency and referral to the Department of Justice for
litigation.

Other collection tools available, which may be used, include Federal
salary offset and administrative wage garnishment. If the debt is
discharged, it may be reported to the IRS as potential taxable income.

During the collection process, interest will continue to accrue on the
debt and you will remain legally responsible for any amount not
satisfied through the collection efforts.

[For Individual Debtors Filing a Joint Federal Income Tax
Return]{.underline}

The Treasury Offset Program automatically refers debts to the IRS for
offset. Your Federal income tax refund is subject to offset under this
program. If you file a joint income tax return, you should contact the
IRS before filing your tax return to determine the steps to be taken to
protect the share of the refund which may be payable to the non-debtor
spouse.

[Federal Salary Offset]{.underline}

If the facility ownership is either a sole proprietorship or
partnership, your individual salary(s) may be offset if you are or
become a federal employee.

[Medicaid Offset]{.underline}

As authorized at 42 CFR 447.30, (Subsection 1885 of the Social Security
Act), CMS may instruct the State Medicaid Agency to offset the Federal
share of any Medicaid payment due you, your agency and/or related
facilities. At that time, the offset will remain in effect until the
Medicare overpayment is paid in full.

Please read the following instructions carefully to determine what
action you may take to avoid referral for cross servicing/offset.

[Due Process]{.underline}

You have the right to request an opportunity to inspect and copy records
relating to the debt. This request must be submitted in writing to the
address listed below. You have a right to present evidence that all or
part of your debt is not past due or legally enforceable. In order to
exercise this right, this office must receive a copy of the evidence to
support your position, along with a copy of this letter. You must submit
any evidence that the debt is not owed or legally enforceable within 60
days of the date of this letter. If, after sixty days from the date of
this letter, we have not received such evidence, your debt, if it is
still outstanding and eligible for referral, will be referred to the
Department of Treasury or its designated Debt Collection Center for
cross servicing/offset.

[Repayment]{.underline}

Your debt will not be referred to the Department of Treasury if you make
payment in full. The past due amount of \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_owed
to the Medicare Program as of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ includes
interest accrued through \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. **(Note: Medicare
contractors may alter this sentence to read: The past due amount owed to
the Medicare Program as of the date of this letter includes current
accrued interest. This sentence may be omitted for debts that do not
accrue interest.)** Interest is accrued monthly and is added to the
balance of the debt.

Your check or money order for the amount due should be made payable to:

> Medicare\
> Contractor Address\
> 000 Street\
> Anywhere, USA 00000-0000.

Include a copy of this letter with your payment.

If you cannot make payment in full, you may be allowed to enter into an
extended repayment agreement. If you are interested in an extended
repayment agreement, please contact this office.

[Bankruptcy]{.underline}

If you have filed for bankruptcy and an automatic stay is in effect, you
are not subject to offset while the automatic stay is in effect.
Documentation supporting your bankruptcy status, along with a copy of
this notice, must be forwarded to this office at the above address.

If you have any questions concerning this debt, please contact
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Sincerely,

> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\

**(Rev. 208, Issued: 04-20-12, Effective: 05-20-12, Implementation:
05-20-12)**

Certain DMEPOS suppliers are required to have surety bonds. Medicare
contractors shall follow instructions in Pub.100-08, chapter 15,
§15.21.7.1, related to collecting claims against surety bonds, if
applicable, in addition to normal debt collection activities.

**90 -- Physician/Supplier Overpayment Demand Letters - Carrier (Rev.
29, 01-02-04)**

When a carrier determines an overpayment for a Part B service the
carrier issues a demand letter to the physician, supplier or
beneficiary.

**90.1 -- Part B Overpayment Demand Letters to Beneficiaries (Rev. 29,
01-02-04)**

See chapter 3, §§100 and110ff

**90.2 - Part B NON-935 Overpayment Demand Letters to
Physicians/Suppliers**

**(Rev. 205; Issued: 02-09-12, Effective: 07-01-12, Implementation:
07-02-12)**

When a physician/supplier is liable for an overpayment of \$10 or more,
the carrier shall attempt recovery through the following procedures. It
shall recover an overpayment made to a physician/supplier as an
individual or to a professional corporation (following the procedures
described below) only from the party to whom the overpayment was made.
It shall make no attempt to recover an overpayment made to an individual
physician/supplier from a professional corporation with which they may
be associated as an employee or stockholder. Conversely, it shall not
attempt recovery from an individual physician/supplier where the
overpayment was made to a professional corporation with which they are,
or were, associated.

**A.Overpayment Amount Is At Least \$10**

When the carrier determines an overpayment it shall issue a demand
letter that requests the\
physician/supplier to pay the debt in full within 30 days, or the amount
owed and any assessed interest will be collected by offset.

**B.Overpayment Demand Letter**

The purpose of an overpayment demand letter is to notify the
physician/supplier of the existence and amount of an overpayment, and to
request repayment. The demand letter shall be written in such a manner
as to fully explain the nature of the overpayment and the amount
determined. Each demand letter shall be:

> •Sent to the physician/supplier by first class mail; and
>
> •Determined within forty-five (45) calendar days of the discovery of
> the overpayment and mailed within seven (7) calendar days of the
> creation of the accounts receivable and generation of the demand
> letter. Longer amounts of time in between discovery and determination
> must be supported by additional documentation. In the case of the
> second request, the letter must be mailed within 45 days but no
> earlier than 30 days after the date of the first demand letter.

**A.Content of Demand Letters**

> •Sent to the physician/supplier.
>
> •For a first request, mail within seven (7) calendar days of
> determination of the overpayment.
>
> •Each demand letter is an explanation of the nature of the
> overpayment, how it was established, in addition, the amount
> determined.
>
> •The Medicare contractor shall include the model immediate recoupment
> process language within the content of the Part B non-935 overpayment
> demand letters to physicians and other suppliers for the Part B
> Non-MSP overpayment demand letters.
>
> •The demand letter shall offer the physician and other supplier the
> opportunity to request an immediate recoupment. Refer to section 80.2.
>
> •The demand letter shall offer the physician/supplier the opportunity
> to apply for an extended repayment plan if immediate repayment of the
> debt will cause financial hardship. An extended repayment plan must be
> approved using the criteria set forth in Chapter 4, §50. Any approved
> repayment plan would run from the date of the FIRST REQUEST
> overpayment demand letter.

•The demand letter constitutes a request to the physician/supplier to
refund the overpaid amount.

> •The demand letter informs physicians/suppliers that the carrier will
> recover the overpayment through the recoupment of current payments due
> or from future claims submitted unless the carrier receives repayment
> or the physician/supplier provides a statement within 15 days of the
> date of the letter of why this action should not take place. The
> demand letter shall also inform\
> physicians/suppliers that this recoupment will begin on the 41st day
> from the date of the letter.
>
> •The demand letter informs physicians/suppliers that interest will
> accrue on the overpayment if payment in full is not received by the
> 31st day from the date of the letter. The demand letter shall also
> inform physicians/suppliers of the applicable interest rate that will
> accrue if payment in full is not received by the 31st day from the
> date of the letter.
>
> •The demand letter informs physicians/suppliers that they have the
> right to request a review or hearing, as appropriate, if they believe
> the determination is not correct. (See Medicare Claims Processing,
> Chapter 29, Appeals of Claims Decisions.) A review is available for
> disputed overpayments of any amount, and a carrier fair hearing is
> available once the review has been conducted if the amount in dispute
> is at least \$100.
>
> •Bankrupt providers. All correspondence, including demand letters,
> addressed to a bankrupt provider must be submitted to the Regional
> Office who has the lead in the bankruptcy proceedings for approval
> prior to release.

The Medicare contractor shall refer to Exhibits I through VI for the
standard formats for each demand and voluntary refund letters to be used
in various overpayment situations.

**B.Recovery by Recoupment**

If, within 15 days of the date of the initial demand letter, the
physician/supplier submits a statement (rebuttal) and/or evidence as to
why recoupment should not be effectuated, the carrier shall promptly
evaluate the material. This is different from a request for appeal (see
subparagraph F) in that you are deciding only whether there is a basis
to not effectuate recoupment. Any correspondence dealing with the basis
of the overpayment does not affect your decision concerning recoupment.
If the carrier determines that recoupment shall begin, it shall notify
the physician/supplier in writing of its determination. It shall give
specific reasons for its decision.

If no such statement (rebuttal) is received or an extended repayment
schedule has not been requested, the contractor shall initiate recovery
by recoupment 40 days after the date of the initial demand letter (day
41), unless the physician/supplier refunds the overpaid amount in full.
The contractor shall apply any amounts payable to the physician/supplier
by reason of assignment on behalf of any beneficiary to recoup the
overpayment. It shall apply any amount recouped first to the accrued
interest and then to the principal.

If it is not possible to make an immediate recoupment, the contractor
shall annotate the physician\'s account so that the overpayment can be
recouped from future Medicare benefits payable. When recoupment is used,
the contractor sends the regular Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) to the
beneficiary. However, it includes with the physician\'s/supplier\'s MSN
an explanation that the benefits (or a specified amount of the benefit)
are being applied to the overpayment and that the physician may not
request the beneficiary to pay the amount applied to the overpayment.

The contractor shall discontinue recoupment only when the overpayment,
plus all accrued interest, is recovered, it is determined on appeal that
the physician/supplier was not overpaid or an acceptable extended
repayment plan request is received (See Chapter 4, §50). After a
favorable appeal decision, the contractor shall refund any excess amount
withheld through recoupment. Also, it shall refund any interest that was
collected.

**C.Follow-up Request**

If the initial demand letter for an overpayment of \$10 or more brings
no response within 30 days, the carrier shall send a follow-up letter
(enclose a copy of the initial letter to the physician/supplier) within
45 days. If any portion of the overpayment has been recovered, it shall
include a statement of that amount.

**D.Physician Appeals Within 30 Days of Notification of the Intent to
Recoup**

If, within 30 days after the date of the initial demand letter informing
the physician/supplier of the intention to recoup, the
physician/supplier submits a request for a review or hearing or
otherwise protests the recovery, the carrier shall make every effort to
conclude the appeal procedure expediently. However, it shall begin
recoupment 40 days after the initial demand, if payment has not been
made, regardless of the status of any appeal request. (See subparagraph
D.)

**E.Demand Letter to Physician Returned as Undeliverable**

Where a refund letter is returned as undeliverable, the carrier shall
attempt to locate the physician/supplier using such sources as telephone
directories, city directories, postmasters, driver\'s license records,
automobile title records, State and local medical societies, the
American Medical Association or its own Medicare beneficiary records.
(See Chapter 4, §80.)

**F. Direct Contact with Physician**

If attempted recoupment of the overpayment is unsuccessful for 30 days,
the carrier shall contact the physician/supplier by telephone. (See
Chapter 4, §80.) **Third Demand Letter**\
If the overpayment has not been recouped and the debt is eligible for
referral to the Department of Treasury an intent to refer letter shall
be sent once the overpayment becomes 90 days delinquent. (See CR 1683 or
Chapter 4, §70)

**EXHIBIT 1- SAMPLE DEMAND LETTERS**

Exhibits I through VI include: the initial demand letter with optional
opening paragraphs and the follow-up letter. It also includes a limited
set of optional paragraphs to be used in specific situations, e.g.,
medical necessity denials, and installment payments. The carrier shall
follow these formats, with the optional paragraphs, when preparing
demand letters.

This section also includes standard letters to be used when the
physician/supplier voluntarily submits a check to the carrier. These
letters are optional if the carrier uses the remittance advice to inform
physicians/suppliers of receipt of their refund checks.

**EXHIBIT 1 - INITIAL Non-935 DEMAND LETTER TO PHYSICIANS/SUPPLIERS**

Dr. Joe Smith\
Anywhere St\
Anytown, State ZIP Code\
Date\
Dear Dr. Smith:

**Contractors should use the appropriate paragraph:**

\"This is to let you know that you have received Medicare payment in
error which has resulted in an overpayment to you of \$\_\_\_\_\_\_ for
services dated \_\_\_\_\_ . The following explains how this happened.\"

or

\"We appreciate your recent inquiry regarding Medicare payment that you
believe was paid to you in error. We thank you for bringing this
overpayment to our attention.\"

or

\"We have received your check in the amount of \$\_\_\_\_\_. We thank
you for bringing this overpayment to our attention. While we appreciate
you submitting payment to us, our review found that the overpaid amount
was \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Please remit the additional \$\_\_\_\_\_\_.\"

**How this overpayment was determined: NOTE:** This paragraph should
include a clear explanation of how the overpayment arose, the amount of
the overpayment, how the overpayment was calculated, and why the
original payment was not correct.

**Why you are responsible:**

**NOTE:** For medical necessity determinations, the carrier shall insert
appropriate paragraphs. It shall be sure to give an 1879 determination
for each claim as well as the regulatory and statutory references for
the 1879 determination.

You are responsible for being aware of correct claim filing procedures
and must use care when billing and accepting payment. In this situation
you billed and/or received payment for services you should have known
you were not entitled to. Therefore, you are not without fault and are
responsible for repaying the overpayment amount. If you dispute this
determination please follow the appropriate appeals process listed
below.

(Applicable Authorities: Section 1870(b) of the Social Security Act; §§
405.350 - 405.359 of Title 42, §§ 404.506 - 404.509, 404.510a and
404.512 of Title 20 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations.)

**What you should do:**

Please return the overpaid amount to us by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_(date)
and no interest charge will be assessed. Make the check payable to
Medicare Part B and send it with a copy of this letter to:

Carrier Name\
Address\
City, State and Postal ZIP Code

**Immediate Recoupment request:**

"You may elect to have your overpayment(s) repaid through the "immediate
recoupment" process and avoid paying by check or waiting for the
standard recoupment that begins on day 41 from date of the initial
demand letter. A request for immediate recoupment must be received in
writing no later than 16 days from the date of initial demand letter.
You must specify whether you are submitting:

1\. A one-time request for the current overpayment and all future
overpayments, or

2\. A request for the current overpayment addressed in this demand
letter only.

This process is voluntary and for your convenience.

Visit our website at or call (USA MEDICARE CONTRACTOR Name) at (XXX)
XXX-XXXX for additional information and instructions for "**Immediate
Recoupment"**.

You may fax your request to XXX-XXX-XXXX.

**If you do not refund in 30 days:**

In accordance with 42 CFR 405.378 simple interest at the rate of \_\_
will be charged on the unpaid balance of the overpayment beginning on
the 31st day. Interest is calculated in 30-day periods and is assessed
for each full 30-day period that payment is not made on time. Thus, if
payment is received 31 days from the date of final determination, one
30-day period of interest will be charged. Each payment will be applied
first to accrued interest and then to principal. After each payment
interest will continue to accrue on the remaining principal balance, at
the rate of \_\_ .

We request that you refund this amount in full. If you are unable to
make refund of the entire amount at this time, advise this office
immediately so that we may determine if you are eligible for a repayment
plan. (See enclosure for details.) Any repayment plan (where one is
approved) would run from the date of this letter.

If payment in full is not received by, (specify a date 40 days from the
date of the notification), payments to you will be withheld until
payment in full is received, an acceptable extended repayment request is
received, or a valid and timely appeal is received. If you have reason
to believe that the withhold should not occur on \_\_\_\_\_ you must
notify \<contractor\> before \_\_\_. We will review your documentation.

However, this is not an appeal of the overpayment determination, and it
will not delay recoupment.

**If you wish to appeal this decision:**

If you disagree with this overpayment decision, you may file an appeal.
An appeal is a review performed by people independent of those who have
reviewed your claim so far. The first level of appeal is called a
redetermination. You must file your request for a redetermination within
120 days of the date you receive this letter. Unless you show us
otherwise, we assume you received this letter 5 days after the date of
this letter. Please send your request for redetermination to:

Address of Redetermination Department

**If you have filed a bankruptcy petition:**

If you have filed a bankruptcy petition or are involved in a bankruptcy
proceeding, Medicare financial obligations will be resolved in
accordance with the applicable bankruptcy process. Accordingly, we
request that you immediately notify us about this bankruptcy so that we
may coordinate with both the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
and the Department of Justice so as to assure that we handle your
situation properly. If possible, when notifying us about the bankruptcy
please include the name the bankruptcy is filed under and the district
where the bankruptcy is filed.

Should you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

If we can assist you further in the resolution of this matter, we shall
be glad to do so. We expect to hear from you shortly.

Sincerely,

Dr. Joe Smith\
Anywhere St\
Anytown, State ZIP Code

Dear (Name of Physician/Supplier):

We previously sent you a letter requesting that you refund an
overpayment made to you. Enclosed you will find a copy of the initial
letter sent to you which explains how the overpayment was determined and
why you are responsible. As of today, we have not heard from you, either
to request an overpayment appeal or to make payment. The overpaid amount
is \_\_\_\_\_\_ (principal plus interest) for your claim that paid on
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ has been recovered.

As stated in our initial letter, offset of the overpayment amount, plus
interest, will be made against any pending and future assigned Medicare
claims.

If you have already sent payment, or our letters have crossed in the
mail, we thank you and ask that you please disregard this letter.

If you have any questions regarding this matter, please contact us at
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Sincerely,

**EXHIBIT 3- INTENT TO REFER LETTER**

When an eligible physician/supplier overpayment remains delinquent for
90 or more days, the carrier shall send an intent to refer letter. (See
CR 1683 and Chapter 4, §70 for more information.)

**EXHIBIT 4 - OPTIONAL OVERPAYMENT CUSTOMIZING PARAGRAPHS**

**A1 -** The carrier shall include this language in all overpayment
letters that involve §1879 medical necessity denials. It shall place it
as the first paragraph under the heading \"Why you are responsible.\"

Based on available information, we have determined that you had or
should have had knowledge that the service(s) were not medically
necessary and reasonable because (i.e., pertinent information was
available from the law and regulations \[provide a cite, if possible\],
from \[cite name/issue number of your newsletter\], from a meeting you
attended on \[date\], and from your peers in the medical community).

(Applicable Authorities: Section 1879 of the Social Security Act;
§§411.404 and 411.406 of Title 42 of the United States Code of Federal
Regulations.)

**NOTE:** The carrier shall be sure to include the applicable
authorities at the end of the §1879 language as it appears here.

**A2 -** The carrier shall include this language in all overpayment
letters that involve §1879 medical necessity denials where payment was
collected from the beneficiary.

This overpayment is for services that are not medically reasonable and
necessary per Medicare standards. If you collected the amount of the
overpayment from the beneficiary, the beneficiary has the right to
request payment from Medicare. Any such indemnification will be
recovered from you.

**B1 -** The carrier shall include the following paragraph in all
overpayment letters that involve payment in excess of the allowed
charge.

The overpayment resulted from payment made to you in excess of the
allowed charge for services. If you have collected a coinsurance and/or
deductible from the beneficiary based on the incorrect amount, please be
sure to refund the excess amount to the beneficiary.

**B2 -** The carrier shall include one of the appropriate paragraphs
below in all overpayment letters that involve duplicate payments.

> •The overpayment resulted from excess payments caused by multiple
> processing of the same charge.
>
> •The overpayment resulted from Medicare payment on an assigned claim
> for which the beneficiary also received payment on an itemized bill
> and turned his payment over to you. Therefore, you are liable for
> \$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ which represents that portion of the total amount
> paid in excess of the fee schedule amount.
>
> •You have mistakenly received duplicate primary payment from both
> Medicare and another entity (Specific payer). (Specific payer) is the
> appropriate payer. As such, you are liable for the portion of the
> Medicare payment in excess of the amount Medicare is obligated to pay
> as secondary payer.
>
> •This overpayment resulted from duplicate Medicare payments to you for
> services you provided to (**named beneficiary**).

**NOTE:** The above paragraphs are not all-inclusive.

**90.3 - Notification to the Beneficiary When Recovery Is Sought from
the Provider or Physician**\
**(Rev. 70, Issued: 05-27-05; Effective and Implementation dates:
06-27-05)**

When a claim adjustment creates an overpayment the beneficiary who
received the services will normally receive a Medicare Summary Notice
(MSN) notifying the beneficiary about the specifics of the adjustment
and the beneficiary's appropriate appeal rights. The MSN uses codes with
accompanying descriptions to update the beneficiary. Through a MSN code,
the MSN can also be used to inform the beneficiary that the provider may
be requested to repay the difference in the amount paid and the
adjustment to Medicare.

In situations where the claim adjustment creates an overpayment and a
MSN is generated, a separate notice to the beneficiary is **not**
required whenever recovery is sought from the provider.

However, if a MSN is not generated a separate notice to the beneficiary
is required whenever recovery is sought from the provider. Some reasons
a MSN may not generate include, but are not limited to, if the claim has
been purged from the system or if the overpayment is because of a mass
adjustment. In these situations a separate notice to the beneficiary is
required whenever recovery is sought from the provider.

(See Chapter 3, §§100 & 110ff when recovering from the beneficiary.)

The following instructions apply if a separate notice to the beneficiary
is required.

The contractor shall include in the notification to the beneficiary a
copy of the letter sent to the provider unless the letter to the
provider mentions more than one beneficiary or deals with overpayments
which do not concern the particular being notified. In such cases, a
copy of the initial demand letter sent to the provider should **not** be
attached to the beneficiary notice.

Where overpayments to a provider have been determined by means of a
sample study, the Contractor shall send a notice only to the
beneficiaries identified in the overpayment notice sent to the provider
as individuals on whose behalf the provider was overpaid a specified
amount. It shall not send the notice to the beneficiaries until it has
been established that recovery action will be taken.

In all cases the notice to the beneficiary should contain the following:

> • The name and address of the provider and dates of service for which
> the overpayment was made.
>
> • A clear explanation of why the payment was incorrect.
>
> • A statement that the provider has been requested to refund the
> overpayment and, if the provider is liable for medically unnecessary
> services or (FIs only) custodial care, the following additional
> information, as applicable:
>
> • If the error is discovered subsequent to the third calendar year
> after the year the payment was approved, and the other conditions
> described in Chapter 3, §80 apply, the Contractor shall advise the
> beneficiary that the provider is prohibited, by law, from requesting
> payment for the services; or
>
> • If the beneficiary is determined to be without fault, the Contractor
> shall state that if the beneficiary pays for the services, the
> beneficiary may request that the Contractor indemnify the beneficiary
> for such payment. Any indemnification paid to the beneficiary will be
> recovered from the provider. (See Medicare Claims Processing Manual,
> Chapter 30, Financial Liability Protections.)
>
> • In all other cases, Medicare law does not prohibit the provider from
> requesting the beneficiary to pay.

An explanation of the beneficiary\'s appeal rights. (See Medicare Claims
Processing Manual, Chapter 29, Appeals of Claims Decisions.) In the
notice to the beneficiary, however, the Contractor shall not mention
waiver since there is no provision for waiver when the physician is
liable for the overpayment.

**90.4 - Sample Letter to Beneficiary Where Recovery Is Sought From
Provider (Rev. 70, Issued: 05-27-05; Effective and Implementation dates:
06-27-05)**

A notice to the beneficiary is required whenever a provider is requested
to repay Medicare because of an overpayment determined as a result of
services provided to the beneficiary. If a MSN is generated the
appropriate notice codes shall be utilized informing the beneficiary
that the provider may be requested to repay Medicare. If this occurs no
further action needs to be taken. However, if a MSN is not generated
notice shall be sent to the beneficiary. Below is a sample letter to a
beneficiary where recovery is sought from the provider.

Dear \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_:

In (**month and year**), we made a payment to (**provider or physician
name and location**[)]{.underline} on your behalf for services provided
to you (insert dates).

We have reviewed the payment and determined that the services were not
covered under the Medicare program.

(The Contractor shall explain as clearly as possible the reason why all,
or part, of the payment was erroneous.)

**It shall use either paragraphs A, B or C below as appropriate:**

**A - Provider Liable for Medically Unnecessary or Custodial Care
Services** **(Physician Liable for Medically Unnecessary Services)**

(See Medicare Claims Processing, Chapter 30, Financial Liability
Protections.)

We have found that you (the beneficiary) did not know or have any way of
knowing that the services you (he/she) received during (**dates of
services for which beneficiary\'s liability has been waived**) would not
be considered to be reasonable and necessary by Medicare. However, the
records show that (physician's name) should have known that such
services would be considered noncovered. When this situation occurs, the
law requires that the liability for these noncovered services be
transferred to the physician.

Therefore, you (the beneficiary) are (is) not responsible for the
charges billed by (**provider\'s name**) except for any charges for
services or items never covered by Medicare. If you (the beneficiary)
have (has) paid (**provider\'s name**) for these services, you may be
entitled to a refund. To obtain this refund, please advise this office
and enclose the following documents:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| > •\                              | > A copy of this notice;\         |
| > •\                              | > The bill you received for the   |
| > •                               | > services; and\                  |
|                                   | > The payment receipt from        |
|                                   | > (provider\'s name), your        |
|                                   | > cancelled check, or any other   |
|                                   | > evidence                        |
+===================================+===================================+
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

showing that you (the beneficiary) have (has) already paid (provider\'s
name) for the services at issue.

You should file your written request for payment within 6 months of the
date of this notice.

**B. Provider at Fault and Beneficiary Not at Fault for Medically
Unnecessary or Custodial Services and the Overpayment was Discovered
Subsequent to the Third Calendar Year After Year Payment Was Approved**

(**Provider\'s name**) has been requested to refund this overpayment.
Under the Medicare law, (**provider\'s name**) is prohibited from
billing you, or any other source, for these noncovered services. If
(**provider\'s name**) sends you a bill for these services, send it to
us with a copy of this letter.

**C. All Other Cases**

(**Provider\'s name**) has been requested to refund the overpayment.
Since the above services are not covered by Medicare, (**Provider\'s
name**) may ask you to pay for them. However, if you are billed, this is
a matter between you and (**Provider\'s name**) and will not affect your
entitlement to future Medicare benefits in any way.

**NOTE:** The notification of appeal rights should be in accordance with
the reopening rules in Medicare Claims Processing, Chapter 29, Appeals
of Claims Decisions.

**110 - Confirmed Identity Theft**\
**(Rev. 336: Issued: 02-07-20: Effective:05-08-20: Implementation;
05-08-20)**

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is addressing

> and/or 1099-MISC, and the recall of the overpayment(s) from Treasury.
> The letter shall also include all claim/document control numbers of
> all affected claims and all original accounts receivable amounts
> (principal and interest) that were adjusted down.

**110.2 - Seized Monies Received from Law Enforcement**\
**(Rev. 199, Issued: 11-04-11, Effective: 12-05-11, Implementation:
12-05-11)**

The contractor shall apply any seized monies received (e.g., Treasury
check) from the perpetrator of the identity theft to the fraudulent debt
in accordance with the Medicare Financial Management Manual,
Publication, 100-06, Chapter 5.

**120 -- Monitoring Accounts Receivable that are in a Redetermination or
Reconsideration Status**\
**(Rev. 261, Issued: 01-29-16, Effective: 03-01-16, Implementation:
03-01-16)**

The MAC shall develop controls to monitor accounts receivable (ARs) that
are in the first\
(redetermination) or second (reconsideration) level of appeal. ARs that
are in either level of appeal are subject to limitations on recoupment
as mandated by Section 935(f)(2)(a) of the Medicare Modernization Act of
2003. The MAC shall monitor these ARs to make sure the "days in status"
are not greater than 120. If the "days in status" are greater than 120,
the MAC shall research the appeal to determine the status/decision of
the appeal and update the AR's status accordingly.

The Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 1, Section 80.2.1.2,
Payment Floor Standards, describe the method of calculation of the
applicable calendar days as described in SSA §1816(c)(3) & §1842(c)(3).
For the purpose of implementing this section, the Payment Floor Date, as
described in Chapter 1, Section 80.2.1.2, is the earliest day after
receipt of the clean claim that payment may be made. Any claims payment
amounts owed to the provider of services, hospital, or supplier, which
are held on the payment floor, but have not yet reached the Payment
Floor Date, regardless of date of\
submission, shall be considered "obligation(s) existing at the time
thereof" the IRS Levy is received by CMS.
