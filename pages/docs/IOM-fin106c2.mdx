# 10 - General - (Rev. 2, 08-30-02)

## A1-1300, B1-4300

> This chapter establishes fiscal controls to ensure efficient use of
> the Health Insurance Trust Funds. These controls are necessary to
> implement program objectives and to carry them out within established
> limitations. Each contractor shall plan its operation within the lower
> of the approved annual budget, the approved periodic budget
> distributions and the certified funds available for Program Management
> (PM) and Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) budgets separately, and
> without co-mingling. It is responsible for performing a continuing
> analysis of the approved budget in light of experience and projected
> future needs. It shall report any change in fiscal requirements to
> CMS. ([[See
> §120]{.underline}](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/106_financial/#s120).)
>
> Monthly Interim Expenditure Reports (IERs) prepared for PM and MIP
> funding, are required to assure adequate financing of the program and
> to enable CMS to control its overall expenditures. A Final
> Administrative Cost Proposal (FACP) is required after the expiration
> of the FY to form the basis for the audit and final determination of
> allowable costs. (See §180 for a list of all budget execution reports
> due.)
>
> The contractor shall prepare a narrative identification of unallowable
> costs for all cost reports in accordance with Chapter 7, Section 3,
> Accountability and Chapter 1, §80.B.

# 20 - Cost Report Forms Supply - (Rev. 2, 08-30-02)

## A1-1301, B1-4301

> Copies of all cost reports referred to in the ensuing sections can be
> obtained from the Contractor Administrative-Budget and Cost Reporting
> (CAFM II) System.

# - Contractors Performing Services for Other Medicare Contractors - (Rev. 2, 08-30-02)

## A1-1302, B3-4302

> When services such as provider audit, EDP processing, bill/claims
> processing, and appeals are performed by a Medicare contractor for
> another Medicare contractor, the receiving contractor shall report
> costs as subcontract costs. It shall not include the productive hours
> associated with the subcontract costs on the Activity Form. See
> Chapter 1, §210.
>
> The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) performs most of
> the Plan PRRB appeal activity. However, some Plans still maintain
> their own Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB) representation
> and may require BCBSA assistance periodically. If a Blue Cross Plan
> requests the assistance of the BCBSA in connection with a specific
> PRRB appeal, BCBSA invoices the Plan for the cost and is paid by the
> Plan and the standard procedures for reporting costs are followed.

# - Servicing Contractor

### *(Rev. 128; Issued: 07-13-07; Effective: 10-01-06; Implementation: 08-13-07)*

> The servicing contractor shall accrue the costs involved and submit a
> monthly invoice to the receiving contractor. It shall submit invoices
> promptly to permit the receiving contractor to submit its IER on a
> timely basis. It shall include adjustments to previous invoices in
> subsequent invoices. The servicing contractor must have adequate
> documentation by cost category to support the invoice amount. It shall
> not include these costs in its cost reports.

# - Receiving Contractor - (Rev. 2, 08-30-02)

## A1-1302.2, B1-4302.2

> The receiving contractor shall include the invoiced amount as
> subcontract costs in all appropriate functions and activities on the
> IER, Contractor Auditing and Settlement Report (CASR) CMS-1525A,
> (Intermediaries Only), and FACP submitted to CMS. It shall include the
> servicing contractor\'s name in the Remarks section of the Activity
> Form. It shall develop estimates for use in cost reports when the
> servicing contractor does not submit an invoice in time for inclusion
> in the cost report.

# 40 - Special Cost Reporting Issues - (Rev. 2, 08-30-02)

## A1-1303, B1-4303

> Shared system costs and CWF satellite costs for ongoing maintenance,
> as well as for the other costs of the user groups, e.g., travel, are
> to be allocated according to the following instructions.
>
> The general rule for allocating costs when more than one Medicare
> function/activity is affected is to allocate time and cost equitably
> to the activities benefiting from the related work. There are three
> generally acceptable approaches for allocating such costs.
>
> Charge ongoing costs to Activity 11001, Bills/Claims Processing, if
> the work primarily benefits that activity;
>
> Charge ongoing costs to the activities which benefit from the work, if
> the benefit can be demonstrated and is documented; or
>
> If the cost is small and the related work generally benefits all
> Medicare functions, it may be allocated to all Medicare activities
> using the same or similar methodology to that stated in chapter 1,
> §90.10, on overhead costs. Note that this is not a statement that such
> costs are an overhead cost, but only that such costs may be allocated
> in the same or similar manner.

# - Instructions for Completing the Variance Analysis Explanation Report

> **(Rev. 2, 08-30-02)**

## A1-1332.2, B1-4332.2

> The contractor\'s explanation must include the reason for the variance
> and what action is being taken to correct the variance by the next
> IER, e.g., redirection of efforts, abatement of activities (CMS
> approval required), a supplemental budget request, reduction or
> increase in staff, or temporary workload backlog. Statements such as
> \"We have exceeded the variance tolerance because adequate funds were
> not provided by CMS in the budget approval\" are neither responsive
> nor acceptable. All variances between the September IER and the FACP
> must be explained as defined in §140.

A.  The contractor shall identify the month and FY of the report.

B.  For each activity cost or workload that exceeds the tolerance
    percentage as indicated in CAFM II, the contractor shall complete
    the following in its narrative explanation to the RO:

> It shall enter the code number and name for the function or activity.
> It shall enter the variance percentage as displayed in CAFM II, and It
> shall enter the explanation of the variance.

C.  The contractor shall submit narrative explanations to the RO via
    electronic media. Specific instructions on the type of word
    processing package to use can be obtained from the contractor\'s RO.

# 100 - Fiscal Year Over Expenditures - October-September IER - (Rev. 2, 08-30-02)

## A1-1333, B1-4333

> The contractor\'s contract with CMS requires staying within approved
> budget amounts and levels of certified funds. It shall analyze its
> financial position in order to advise CMS, in a timely manner, of any
> anticipated significant deviations. In the event the administrative
> costs reported in the October-September IER exceed the total approved
> budget, it shall furnish documentation justifying the over expenditure
> to its RO with a copy to CO. The request for funding will not
> necessarily be approved.
>
> The CMS reviews justifications for adequacy and, where appropriate and
> if funding is available, issues a revised NOBA that enables the
> contractor to draw additional funds. The RO may advise the contractor
> that consideration of a budget revision is postponed until the FACP is
> received and analyzed, e.g., where the amount of the over-expenditure
> is relatively minor or where the contractor has not justified the
> over-expenditure. This does not adversely affect the claim for the
> funds.

# 110 -- Control of Administrative Funds Drawn

> ***(Rev. 23, 10-24-03)***

## A1-1340, B1-4340

> The funding level approved by Congress limits the approval of funds.
> The contractor shall draw funds to the lower of the cumulative
> quarterly distribution certified on the NOBA or the *Total Costs
> (amount expended) as reported on the IER or FACP*. It shall draw
> administrative funds during the period in line with expenditures.
> Funds drawn during the subsequent month must be adjusted for
> administrative funds drawn in excess of actual costs reported.

# 120 - Budget Amount Appears Insufficient - (Rev. 2, 08-30-02)

## A1-1351, B1-4351

A.  Submission of SBR

> The contractor shall submit an SBR whenever it appears that the
> budgeted amount is insufficient to adequately perform the required
> functions and the need for additional funds can be adequately
> documented. As a general rule, it shall submit the SBR no later than
> 90 days prior to the exhaustion of funds so as to allow CMS sufficient
> time to respond prior to the need to submit an abatement notice. (See
> B below.) The SBR should never be submitted less than 60 days prior to
> the exhaustion of funds unless it can be demonstrated that it could
> not have been given in advance. Resolution of the SBR may include:
>
> An increase in the budget; Institution of additional efficiencies;
>
> A reduction of functions to be performed; or Other ways and means
> agreeable to both parties.
>
> The contractor shall discuss these alternatives in the SBR and, if
> after negotiating in good faith, there is no satisfactory resolution,
> CMS will send a written rationale denying all or part of the SBR.

B.  Abatement Notice

> The contractor shall submit a written abatement notice to the RO no
> less than 60 days prior to the date on which it appears that the
> budgeted amount is insufficient to adequately perform the required
> functions in accordance with the Cost of Administration Article in the
> Contract/Agreement.

# - Cost Accounting Standards - General - (Rev. 2, 08-30-02)

## A1-1520, B1-4520

> The Medicare contracts, include a provision for the application of
> through cost accounting standards to the contractors\' accounting
> systems. The three standards included in the contract are intended to
> achieve a degree of uniformity and consistency in the contractors\'
> cost accounting practices to be used in connection with their Medicare
> operations. Following is a discussion concerning the interpretation of
> the applicable standards:

# - Consistency in Estimating, Accumulating, and Reporting Costs - (Rev. 2, 08-30-02)

## A1-1521, B1-4521

> The objective of this standard is to maintain a consistency in the
> cost accounting practices employed by a contractor in its methods used
> for estimating costs and in its practices used in accumulating and
> reporting cost during the course of the contract of fiscal period.
> Consistency in cost accounting practices provides reasonable assurance
> that comparable transactions are treated alike. This assurance is
> critical to our program since it provides a reliable basis for valid
> comparisons between estimated, incurred, and reported costs.
>
> This consistency requirement addresses the accounting structure of the
> contractor\'s proposed budget - that is the cost accounting practices
> used in preparing the budget - not to the amounts estimated or the
> estimating techniques used. The standard also requires that a
> contractor\'s cost accounting practices used in accumulating and
> reporting actual costs for the Medicare contract shall be consistent
> with its practices used for estimating costs for the related budget
> for the same fiscal year. The contractor must comply with this
> requirement through the term of the contract.
>
> This standard extends to all levels of the contractor\'s cost
> accounting system. Therefore, it is necessary that the contractors
> periodically review their methodologies for preparing their budgets in
> order to obtain the consistency required with the accounting records.
>
> The standard essentially requires that significant items of costs be
> accorded the same accounting treatment in the estimate and the cost
> records.
>
> There is no presumption that either of the requirements described
> above is violated when a contractor groups homogeneous costs in his
> estimate, but accumulates and reports such costs in greater detail
> during contract performance. If it is not practicable to estimate by
> individual cost element or function, the contractor may use groupings
> of homogeneous costs in his estimate provided:
>
> Such grouping does not impair ability to compare any significant cost
> in an estimate with the actual cost accumulated and reported, and
>
> Estimating practices and accounting practices are consistent with
> respect to: The classification of costs as direct or indirect,
>
> The indirect cost pool assignments to which each element or function
> of cost is charged or proposed to be charged, and
>
> The methods of allocating indirect costs to the contract.

# 200.2- Consistency in Allocating Costs Incurred for the Same Purposes - (Rev. 2, 08-30-02)

## A1-1522, B1-4522

> The purpose of this standard is to require that each type of cost is
> allocated only once and on only one basis to our contract or other
> cost objective. Thus, no cost may be allocated to a final cost
> objective as an indirect cost if other costs incurred for the same
> purpose
>
> and in like circumstances have been included as a direct cost of that
> same or any other cost objective. Conversely, no cost may be allocated
> to an objective as a direct cost if other costs incurred for the same
> purpose have been included in any indirect cost pool to be allocated
> to the same or any other cost objective. The requirement of the
> standard, though stated in terms of costs incurred, is equally
> applicable to estimates of costs as used in the contractors\' budget
> preparation.
>
> For the sake of practicality, minor items of direct costs may be
> treated as indirect costs, provided that the treatment is consistently
> applied to all final cost objectives and provided that the results are
> substantially the same as would have been produced if each such cost
> had been treated as a direct cost. This materiality provision is an
> integral part of this standard.

# 200.3 - Accounting for Unallowable Costs - (Rev. 2, 08-30-02)

## A1-1523, B1-4523

> The purpose of this standard is to establish guidelines for the early
> identification of unallowable costs and the treatment to be accorded
> such costs. It is based on the premise that costs should be allocated
> to their appropriate cost objectives according to beneficial or casual
> relationships and without regard to their allowability. The standard
> is concerned with the broad accounting principles that govern cost
> allocation, not with making otherwise allowable costs unallowable.
>
> Generally, identification is required under varying circumstances for
> the following classes of unallowable costs:
>
> Those which are expressly unallowable or mutually agreed to be
> unallowable,
>
> Those which become designated as unallowable by reason of the
> Secretary\'s determination,
>
> Those which are directly associated with either (l) or (2),
>
> Those which arise out of a work project not contractually authorized,
> and Those costs for which reimbursement has been previously withheld
> by BHI.
>
> In addition, costs incurred for the same purpose under like
> circumstances as unallowable costs must be identified.
>
> Expressly unallowable costs consist primarily of those specified as
> unallowable in the principles of reimbursement. These costs, as well
> as costs mutually agreed to be unallowable or mutually agreed to be
> directly associated with unallowables, must be identified in the
> contractors\' accounting records and excluded from any submitted
> budget and cost reports.
>
> When the Secretary\'s determination designates certain costs
> unallowable because they are directly associated with other
> unallowables, those costs, too, must be identified if used in budgets
> and cost reports.
>
> Costs designated as unallowable by the Secretary\'s determination, as
> well as costs incurred for the same purpose under like circumstances
> as those mutually agreed to be unallowable, must be identified if
> included in a budget or cost report.
>
> The costs of work not contractually authorized must be accounted for
> in a manner that permits ready separation from the costs of authorized
> work projects.
