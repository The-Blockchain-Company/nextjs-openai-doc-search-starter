## 10 - *Understanding MSP: Definitions and Important Terminology*

### *(Rev. 11755, Issued:12-21-2022, Effective: 01-23-2023, Implementation: 01-23-23)*

> *The following section provides the most commonly used MSP definitions
> and terms. These* definitions and terms will be frequently referenced
> throughout this chapter of the IOM as well as the remaining Pub.
> 100-05.
>
> Accident - An unintended occurrence outside the normal course of
> events that causes illness, injury, or damage to a person or property.
>
> Age 65 or older -- An individual attains age 65 on the day preceding
> his or her 65^th^ birthday.
>
> Automobile - Any self-propelled land vehicle of a type that must be
> registered and licensed in the State in which it is owned.
>
> CMS\' Claim - In the context of Workers' Compensation (WC), no-fault,
> and liability claims, the amount that is determined to be owed to the
> Medicare program. This is the lesser of the total sum of the
> settlements, judgments, or awards related to the underlying WC,
> no-fault, or liability claim; or the amount that was paid out by
> Medicare, less any applicable share of procurement costs.
>
> Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) - A
> Title X provision that provides continuation of GHP coverage if
> elected. For aged or disabled Medicare beneficiaries, COBRA
> continuation coverage is secondary to Medicare because the coverage is
> by virtue of COBRA law rather than by virtue of current employment
> status.
>
> For an ESRD related Medicare beneficiary, COBRA continuation coverage,
> if elected, is primary to Medicare during the 30-month ESRD
> coordination period. See [42]{.underline} [CFR]{.underline}
> [411.161(a)(3)]{.underline} and [411.162(a)(3)]{.underline}.
>
> Compromise - A settlement of differences by mutual consent or
> adjustment of matters in dispute by mutual concession; a negotiated
> settlement between parties who are in essentially equal bargaining
> positions, wherein neither party admits or concedes that he is
> entitled to less than he desires, but accepts less to affect the goal
> of ending the dispute. In an MSP situation under the Federal Claims
> Collection Act, a compromise represents the acceptance by the Regional
> Office (RO) of less than the full debt owed to Medicare, when the
> amount of the full debt does not exceed \$100,000, or by Central
> Office (CO) when the amount exceeds \$100,000. An individual who
> accepts a compromise has no right to appeal the remaining debt.
>
> Conditional Payment - A Medicare payment, conditioned upon
> reimbursement to Medicare, for items or services for which another
> insurer is the primary payer.
>
> Coordination Period - A period of 30 months during which Medicare
> benefits are secondary to benefits payable under GHPs for individuals
> who are eligible for Medicare because of ESRD.
>
> Current Employment Status - *An individual that is:*

-   *Actively working as an employee, is the employer (including a
    self-employed person), or is associated with the employer in a
    business relationship; or*

-   *The individual is not actively working and is receiving disability
    benefits from an*

> *employer for up to 6 months (the first 6 months of employer
> disability benefits are subject to* FICA taxes); or not actively
> working but meets ***all** of the following conditions:*

-   *Retains employment rights in the industry;*

-   *Has not had their employment terminated by the employer if the
    employer provides the coverage or has not had his/her membership in
    the employee organization terminated if the employee organization
    provides the coverage;*

-   *Is not receiving disability benefits from an employer for more than
    > 6 months;*

-   *Is not receiving Social Security disability benefits, and*

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   *Has employment-based GHP coverage that is not COBRA continuation
    coverage. \[See 29 U.S.C. 1161-1168.\]*

> *Note, A person aged 65 or older and receiving disability payments
> from an employer is* considered to have current employment status if
> such payments are subject to taxes under FICA. Employer disability
> payments are subject to FICA tax for the first six months of
> disability after the last calendar month in which the employee worked
> for that employer.
>
> Eligibility - A beneficiary meets the legal requirements for Medicare
> benefits. It is still necessary to file an application to become
> entitled. (For example, a Social Security beneficiary is eligible for
> Medicare upon attaining age 65 but is not entitled until an
> application is filed and approved).
>
> Employee - An individual who is working for an employer or an
> individual who, although not actually working for an employer, is
> receiving payments from an employer that are subject to FICA taxes or
> would be subject to FICA taxes except that the employer is exempt from
> those taxes under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).
>
> Employer - In addition to individuals (including self-employed
> persons) and organizations engaged in a trade or business, other
> entities exempt from income tax such as religious, charitable, and
> educational institutions. Included are the governments of the United
> States, the individual States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam,
> American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, the District of
> Columbia, and foreign governments.
>
> Entitled - An eligible individual becomes entitled to Medicare by
> filing the appropriate
>
> application. Upon approval of the application, the individual is
> entitled. It may also be necessary to enroll for certain services in
> order to get them.
>
> Family Member - A person enrolled in a GHP based on another person\'s
> enrollment. Family members may include, but are not limited to, a
> spouse (including a divorced or common law spouse); a natural,
> adopted, or foster child; a stepchild; a parent; or a sibling.
>
> FICA - The Federal Insurance Contributions Act, the law that imposes
> Social Security taxes on employers and employees under §21 of the
> Internal Revenue Code.
>
> Fiduciary - A person in a position of trust with regard to the affairs
> of another, who has a duty to act primarily for the benefit of the
> other, with respect to a particular undertaking.
>
> GHP (Group Health Plan) - Any arrangement of, or contributed to by,
> one or more employers or employee organizations to provide health
> benefits or medical care directly or indirectly to current or former
> employees, the employer, others associated or formerly associated with
> the employer in a business relationship, or their families. An
> arrangement by more than one employer is considered to be a single
> plan if it provides for common administration of the health benefits
> (e.g., by the employers directly or by a benefit administrator or by a
> multi-employer trust or by an insuring organization under a contract
> or contracts).
>
> A plan that does not have any employees or former employees as
> enrollees (e.g., a plan for self-employed persons only) does not meet
> the definition of a GHP and Medicare is not secondary to it. Thus, if
> an insurance company establishes a plan solely for its self- employed
> insurance agents, other than insurance agents, the plan is not
> considered a GHP. However, if the plan includes insurance agents or
> other employees or former employees, it is considered a GHP.
>
> The term \"GHP\" includes self-insured plans, plans of governmental
> entities (Federal, State, and local such as the Federal Employees
> Health Benefits Program), and employee organization plans. Examples of
> the latter are union plans and employee health and welfare funds.
> Employee-pay-all plans are also included (i.e., GHPs which are under
> the auspices of one or more employers or employee organizations but
> which do not receive any contribution from the employer). Individual
> policies (including Medigap policies) purchased by or through an
> employee organization, employer or former employer of the individual
> or family member of the individual are considered employer offered
> GHPs.
>
> However, coverage under the TRICARE, formerly known as the Civilian
> Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) is not
> considered to meet the definition of a GHP. It is secondary to
> Medicare since the law makes Medicare primary to TRICARE *unless the
> individual is under active duty status.*
>
> Any health plan (including a union plan) in which a beneficiary is
> enrolled because his/her employment or a family member\'s employment
> meets this definition.
>
> Judgment - The official and authentic decision of a court of justice
> upon the respective rights of the parties to an action submitted to it
> for determination.
>
> LGHP (Large Group Health Plan) - A GHP that covers employees of
> either:

-   A single employer or employee organization that employed at least
    100 full-time

> or part-time employees on 50 percent or more of its regular business
> days during the previous calendar year; or

-   Two or more employers or employee organizations at least one of
    which employed at least 100 full-time or part-time employees on 50
    percent or more of its regular business days during the previous
    calendar year.

-   It includes individual policies (including, in rare circumstances,
    Medigap policies) purchased by an or through an employer or former
    employer of the individual or family member.

> Liability - Responsibility or fault for damages arising out of a
> specified incident.
>
> Liability Insurance - Insurance (including a self-insured plan) that
> provides payment based on alleged legal liability for injury, illness
> or damage to property. It includes, but is not limited to, automobile
> liability, uninsured and under-insured motorist, homeowner\'s
> liability, malpractice, product liability and general casualty
> insurance. It includes payments under State \"wrongful death\"
> statutes that provide payment for medical damages.
>
> Liability Insurance Payment - A payment by a liability insurer, or an
> out-of-pocket payment, including a payment to cover a deductible
> required by a liability insurer, by any individual or other entity
> that carries liability insurance or is covered by a self-insured plan.
>
> Lump Sum Commutation Settlement - A workers' compensation settlement
> in which the beneficiary accepts a lump sum payment that compensates
> for all future medical expenses and disability benefits related to the
> work injury or disease.
>
> Lump Sum Compromise Settlement - A workers' compensation settlement
> that provides less in total compensation than the individual would
> have received if he or she had received full reimbursement for lost
> wages and lifelong medical treatment for the injury or illness. This
> may occur when compensability is contested.
>
> MSP - *The \"Medicare Secondary Payer\" provisions of the Social
> Security Act, also used to* describe situations where those provisions
> apply.
>
> Med-Pay - A payment made by an insurer intended specifically to pay
> for medical expenses without regard to the fault of any party to the
> accident. Med-Pay is a form of no-fault insurance.
>
> Multi-employer Group Health Plan - A plan that is sponsored jointly or
> contributed to by two or more employers (sometimes called a multiple
> employer plan) or by employers and unions (as under the Taft-Hartley
> law).
>
> No-Fault Insurance - Insurance that pays for medical expenses for
> injuries sustained or on the property or premises of the insured, or
> in the use, occupancy, or operation of an automobile, regardless of
> who may have been responsible for causing the accident. This insurance
> includes, but is not limited to, automobile, homeowners, and
> commercial plans. It includes \"medical payments coverage,\"
> \"personal injury protection,\" or \"medical expense coverage.\"
> Examples of no-fault insurance include homeowners and commercial
> medical payments insurance, commonly referred to as Med-pay coverage.
>
> Nonconforming Group Health Plan or Large Group Health Plan - *A plan
> that at any time* during the calendar year takes into account that an
> individual is eligible for, or receives, benefits based on working
> aged or disability, e.g., a plan fails to pay primary benefits for
> Medicare entitled individuals for whom Medicare is secondary payer in
> accordance with the MSP provisions and regulations as found in 42 CFR
> §411.10 and 42 CFR §411.130.
>
> Partial Waiver - A decision by the Medicare program to relinquish the
> right to collect a portion of a debt from a specific entity. A partial
> waiver is not to be confused with a compromise. It is different in
> that it does not arise from negotiation or offer but under 1870(c) of
> the Act, which provides the beneficiary the right to request waiver,
> and Medicare the authority to grant or deny waiver, based on factual
> data. Section 1870(c) allows a partial waiver to a person who is
> without fault or where the adjustment or recovery would defeat the
> purpose of Title II or XVII of the Act (hardship) or be against equity
> and good conscience. An individual may appeal a determination based on
> 1870(c) of the Act if the determination grants only partial waiver of
> a debt.
>
> Payment in full -- An amount that the provider, physician, or other
> supplier is obligated to accept (e.g., contractually), or voluntarily
> accepts, for medical services to an individual from the insurer (e.g.,
> the GHP) in full satisfaction of the patient's payment obligation.
>
> Because Medicare payments are made on behalf of the beneficiary,
> satisfaction of a patient's payment obligation satisfies any Medicare
> payment obligation.
>
> Plan - Any arrangement by an employer, more than one employer, or an
> employee organization to provide health benefits or medical care to
> current or former employees, the employer, others associated or
> formerly associated with the employer in a business relationship, or
> their families. An arrangement by more than one employer is a single
> plan if the arrangement provides for common administration of the
> health benefits. An arrangement may be administered by the employers
> directly, by a benefit administrator, by a multi-employer trust, or by
> an insuring organization under a contract or contracts which stipulate
> that the organizations provide all employees enrolled in the plan the
> same benefits or the same benefit options.
>
> Primary Payer - When used in the context in which Medicare is the
> secondary payer, any entity that is or was required or responsible to
> make payment with respect to an item or service (or any portion
> thereof) under a primary plan. These entities include, but are not
> limited to, insurers or self-insurers, third party administrators, and
> all employers that sponsor or contribute to group health plans or
> large group health plans.
>
> Primary Payment -*Payment for an item or service that is made, or
> reasonably expected to be made, by the entity that has primary payment
> responsibility.* When used in the context in which Medicare is the
> secondary payer, payment by a primary payer for services that are also
> covered under Medicare.
>
> Primary Plan - When used in the context in which Medicare is the
> secondary payer, a group health plan or large group health plan, a
> workers' compensation law or plan, an automobile or liability
> insurance policy or plan (including a self-insured plan), or no-fault
> insurance.
>
> Proceeds - Benefits paid under any insurance plan or policy, or
> annuity contract. Procurement Costs - Attorney fees and other costs
> directly related to securing a settlement
>
> or judgment that are borne by the beneficiary against whom CMS seeks
> to recover.
>
> Prompt or Promptly - With regard to liability insurance means payment
> within 120 days after the earlier of:

-   The date a claim is filed with an insurer or a lien is filed against
    a potential liability settlement; or

-   The date the service was furnished or, in the case of inpatient
    hospital services, the date of discharge.

> With regard to no-fault and WC insurance, prompt or promptly means
> payment within 120 days after receipt of the claim.
>
> Proper Claim - A claim that is filed timely and meets all other claims
> filing requirements specified by the plan, program, or insurer (e.g.,
> mandatory second opinion, prior notification before seeking
> treatment).
>
> Recovery - Proceeds obtained from a judgment, settlement, erroneous or
> conditional payment.
>
> Secondary --*With respect to Medicare payment,* means that Medicare is
> the residual payer to all plans that are primary plans with respect to
> services provided to a Medicare beneficiary.
>
> Self-Employed Person - An individual is considered to be self-employed
> during a particular tax year only if the individual\'s self-employment
> income, as determined by the IRS, was at least equal to the amount
> specified in §211(b)(2) of the Act, which defines self-employment
> income for Social Security purposes.
>
> Set-Aside Arrangement -- An administrative mechanism used to allocate
> a portion of a settlement, judgment or award for future medical and/or
> future prescription drug expenses. A set-aside arrangement may be in
> the form of a Workers' Compensation Medicare Set- Aside Arrangement
> (WCMSA), No-Fault Medicare Set-Aside Arrangement (NFSA) or Liability
> Medicare Set-Aside Arrangement (LMSA).
>
> SSI (Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind and Disabled) -
> The Federal subsistence income maintenance program for eligible
> individuals. Title XVI of the Social Security Act enacted SSI in 1972
> for the purpose of assuring a minimum level of income for people who
> are age 65 or over, blind, or disabled, and who do not have sufficient
> income and resources to maintain a standard of living at the
> established Federal minimum income level.
>
> Self-Insured Plan - A plan under which an individual, or a private or
> governmental entity, carries its own risk instead of taking out
> insurance with a carrier. The term includes a plan of an individual or
> other entity engaged in a business, trade, or profession, a plan of a
> nonprofit organization such as a social, fraternal, labor,
> educational, religious, or professional organization, and the plan
> established by the Federal government to pay for liability claims
> under the Federal Tort Claims Act. An entity that engages in a
> business, trade or profession shall be deemed to have a self-insured
> plan for purposes of liability insurance if it carries its own risk
> (whether by failure to obtain insurance or otherwise) in whole or in
> part. (With regard to FTCA claims, CMS attempts to collect its
> mistaken payment from the Federal agency that is settling the claim.
> If a resolution cannot be reached, CMS must submit the conflict to the
> Department of Justice for resolution.)
>
> Settlement - An adjustment or agreement by which parties having a
> dispute between them ascertain what each owes the other. In the MSP
> liability context, settlement refers to a monetary amount from a
> liability insurer agreed to by a party in satisfaction of a liability
> dispute.
>
> Spouse -- (on or before December 31, 2014) means a person of the
> opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.
>
> Spouse - (effective on January 1, 2015) for purposes of the working
> aged provisions means a person who is entitled to Medicare as a spouse

> whose marriage is valid in the jurisdiction in which it was performed
> including one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or a U.S.
> territory or a foreign country, so long as that marriage would also be
> recognized by a U.S. jurisdiction.
>
> Statute of Limitations - A specific time period within which certain
> claims must be filed and after which the claim may no longer be
> enforced.
>

> against the responsible party and the liability insurer, to the extent
> that Medicare has made payments to or on behalf of the beneficiary.
>
> Under-insured Motorist Insurance - Insurance under which the
> policyholder\'s level of protection against losses caused by another
> is extended to compensate for inadequate coverage in the party's
> policy or plan.
>
> Uninsured Motorist Insurance - Insurance under which the
> policyholder\'s insurer pays for damages caused by a motorist who has
> no automobile liability insurance or carries less than the amount of
> insurance required by law.
>
> Waiver - The relinquishing of an established right. In an MSP
> situation, it is the forgiveness of the party\'s obligation to satisfy
> Medicare\'s claim, in whole or in part, if certain conditions are met.
>
> Workers\' Compensation Agency - Any governmental entity that
> administers a Federal or State WC law. This term includes WC
> commissions, industrial commissions, industrial boards, WC insurance
> funds, WC courts and, in the case of Federal WC programs, the U.S.
> Department of Labor.
>
> Workers\' Compensation Carrier - Any insurance carrier authorized to
> write WC insurance under the state or federal law, the state
> compensation fund where the state administers the WC program, and the
> beneficiary\'s employer where the employer is self-insured.
>
> Workers\' Compensation Law or Plan - A government-supervised and
> employer-supported system for compensating employees for injury or
> disease suffered in connection with their employment, whether or not
> the injury was the fault of the employer. Workers\' compensation does
> not usually cover agricultural employees, interstate railroad
> employees, employees of small businesses, employees whose work is not
> in the course of the employer\'s business (e.g., domestic employees),
> casual employees, and self-employed people. Although WC programs were
> initially designed to cover accidental injuries suffered in the course
> of employment, all States now provide compensation for at least some
> occupational diseases as well.
>
> Workers' Compensation Medicare Set-Aside Arrangement (WCMSA) - The
> recommended method to protect Medicare's interests in workers'
> compensation (WC) settlements, judgments, or awards which allocate
> funds from the settlement for future medical and/or prescription drug
> expenses. The amount of the set aside is determined on a case-by-case
> basis and should be reviewed by CMS, when appropriate.
>
> Working Aged -- Medicare is secondary for Medicare beneficiaries age
> 65 or older who are covered under a GHP by virtue of their own current
> employment status or the current employment status of a spouse of any
> age. This provision applies to GHPs of employers and employee
> organizations, including multi- employer and multiple employer plans
> which have at least one participating employer that employs 20 or more
> employees.
>
> Wrongful Death - A death caused by a wrongful act, neglect, or fault.

## - *General Provisions*

### *(Rev. 11755, Issued:12-21-22, Effective: 01-23-23, Implementation: 01-23-23)*

> Under the Medicare law, as enacted in 1965, Medicare was the primary
> payer for *all* services except those covered by workers\'
> compensation (WC). In 1980, Congress enacted the first of a series of
> provisions that made Medicare the secondary payer to certain
> additional primary plans. The purpose was to shift costs from the
> Medicare program to private sources of payment. These provisions are
> known as the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) provisions and are found
> at section 1862(b) of the Social Security Act (the Act)*, and
> implemented by 42 CFR § 411.20 and following*. These provisions
> prohibit Medicare from making payment if payment has been made or can
> reasonably be expected to be made by the following primary plans:
> *employer-sponsored* group health plans *(GHPs)*, workers'
> compensation plans, liability insurance *(including self-insurance)*,
> or no-fault insurance *(collectively known as Non-GHPs or NGHPs*.*)*
> If payment has not been made or cannot be
>
> expected to be made promptly by a workers' compensation *law or policy
> of the United States*, liability insurance *(including
> self-insurance)*, or no-fault insurance, Medicare may make a
> conditional payment under some circumstances, subject to Medicare
> payment rules. Conditional payments are made subject to repayment when
> the primary plan makes payment. *When Medicare is the secondary payer,
> any and all payers primary to Medicare are expected to pay before
> Medicare. Medicare does not determine primacy between or among other
> payers when multiple payers are primary to Medicare for a given item
> or service.*
>
> When Medicare is the secondary payer, the provider, physician, or
> other supplier, or beneficiary must first submit the claim to the
> primary payer. The primary payer is required to process and make
> primary payment on the claim in accordance with the coverage
> provisions of its contract. The primary payer may **not** decline to
> make primary payment on the grounds that its contract calls for
> Medicare to pay first. If, after the primary payer processes the
> claim, it does not pay in full for the services, Medicare secondary
> benefits may be paid for the services as prescribed in §10.8.
> Generally, the beneficiary is not disadvantaged where Medicare is the
> secondary payer because the combined payment by a primary payer and by
> Medicare as the secondary payer is the same as or greater than the
> combined payment when Medicare is the primary payer.

## *- Working Aged*

### *(Rev. 11755, Issued:12-21-22, Effective: 01-23-23, Implementation: 01-23-23)*

> *Pursuant to 1862(b)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act, Medicare
> benefits are secondary to* benefits payable under GHPs for individuals
> age 65 or over who have Medicare Part A and who have GHP coverage as a
> result of either:

-   *Their own current employment status with an employer that has 20 or
    more employees; or*

-   *The current employment status of a spouse of any age with an
    employer that has 20 or more employees. (Section 70.2 of this
    chapter and Pub. 100-05, Chapter 2*

> *§10 further defines individuals subject to this limitation on
> payment.)*
>
> ***NOTE**: Effective January 1, 2015, for purposes of the working aged
> provisions, the* definition of spouse was changed. Where, at any time,
> an employer, insurer, third party administrator, GHP, or other plan
> sponsor has a broader or more inclusive definition of spouse for the
> purposes of its GHP arrangement, it may (but is not required to)
> assume primary payment responsibility for the individual in question.
> If such an individual is reported as a spouse through Section 111 of
> the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (MMSEA) (P.L.
> 110-173) (MMSEA), Medicare will pay accordingly and pursue recovery,
> as applicable.
>
> *Employers are required to offer to their employees who are age 65 or
> over, and to the age* 65 or over spouses of employees of any age, the
> same coverage as they offer to employees and employees' spouses under
> age 65, i.e., coverage that is primary to Medicare, regardless of
> entitlement to Medicare. This equal benefit rule applies to coverage
> offered to all employees (full-time and part-time).
>
> *Medicare beneficiaries have the option to reject the employer plan
> coverage, in which case* they retain Medicare as their primary
> coverage. Employers cannot offer such employees, or
>
> *their spouses, secondary coverage for items and services covered by
> Medicare.* Additionally, employers may not sponsor or contribute to
> individual Medigap or Medicare supplement policies for beneficiaries
> who have, or whose spouse has, current employment status. Further
> guidance pertaining to the MSP provisions for working aged individuals

>
> *This limitation also applies to the WC plans of the District of
> Columbia, American Samoa,* Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
> It also applies to the Federal WC plans provided under the Federal
> Employees\' Compensation Act, the U.S. Longshoremen\'s and Harbor
> Workers\' Compensation Act and its extensions, and the
>
> *Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 as amended (the
> Federal Black Lung* Program). These Federal programs provide WC

> an armed conflict, employees paid from non-appropriated Federal funds
> (such as employees of post-exchanges), and offshore oil field workers.
> The Federal Employers\' Liability Act (FELA), which covers merchant

>
> *The beneficiary is responsible for taking whatever action is
> necessary to obtain payment* under WC where payment under that system
> can reasonably be expected (e.g., timely filing a claim, furnishing

## *- Workers' Compensation Medicare Set-aside Arrangements (WCMSAs)*

### *(Rev. 11755, Issued:12-21-22, Effective: 01-23-23, Implementation: 01-23-23)*

> *WC insurers, agencies, and attorneys have significant
> responsibilities under the MSP* provisions of the Social Security Act

> Medicare does not pay for an individual's WC-related medical services
> and/or prescription drugs when the individual receives a WC
> settlement, judgment, or award that includes funds for future medical
> and/or prescription drug expenses, it is in the best interest of the
> individual to consider Medicare at the time of settlement, as required

> of automobile no-fault* insurance, automobile medical payments, and
> non-automobile no-fault insurance. pursuant to 42 CFR § 411.50. (See
> Pub. 100-05, Chapter 2, §60.) No-fault insurance is a form of
> insurance that pays for medical expenses for injuries sustained on the
> property or premises of the insured, or in the use, occupancy, or
> operation of an automobile regardless of who may have been responsible
> for causing the accident. MedPay is a form of no-fault insurance even

> It includes, but is not limited to, homeowners\' liability insurance,
> malpractice insurance, product liability insurance, and general

### *(Rev. 11755, Issued:12-21-22, Effective: 01-23-23, Implementation: 01-23-23)*

> *When specified conditions are met, the MSP statute prohibits Medicare
> from making* payment where payment has been made or can reasonably be
> expected to be made by GHPs, a WC law or plan, liability insurance
> (including self-insurance), or no-fault insurance. If payment has not
> been made or cannot be reasonably be expected to be made promptly by
> WC, liability insurance (including self-insurance), or no-fault

> promptly, with regard to no-fault insurance and workers' compensation,
> means payment within 120 days after receipt of the claim for specific
> items and services by the no-fault insurer or WC entity. In the
> absence of evidence to the contrary, A/B MACs and DME MACs shall treat

>
> *DME MACs shall treat the date of discharge as the date of service
> with respect to no-fault* insurance and WC situations for the purpose
> of determining the promptly period.
>
> *Additionally, A/B MACs and DME MACs shall follow 42 CFR §411.50, also
> reflected in* Pub. 100-05, Chapter 2, for the definition of prompt or
> promptly with regard to liability insurance (including
> self-insurance). Prompt or promptly, with regard to liability
> insurance (including self-insurance), means payment within 120 days
> after the earlier of the following: (1) The date a general liability
> claim is filed with an insurer or a lien is filed against a potential
> liability settlement; and (2) the date the service was furnished or,
> in the case of inpatient services, the date of discharge. Generally,
> the MSP auxiliary record for the liability situation is posted to CWF
> after the beneficiary files a claim against the alleged tortfeasor and
> the associated liability insurance (including self- insurance)
> Accordingly, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the date the
> general liability claim is filed against liability insurance
> (including self-insurance) is no later than the date that the record
> was posted on CWF. Therefore, A/B MACs and DME MACs shall consider the
> date of accretion listed on liability MSP auxiliary record on CWF to
> be the date the general liability claim was filed, for the purposes of
> determining the promptly period, with regard to liability insurance
> (including self-insurance) situations.
>
> *Subject to Medicare payment rules and other stipulations, primary
> payers (GHP, liability* insurance, including self-insurance, no-fault
> insurance, and WC) are obligated to reimburse Medicare if they were
> properly primary to Medicare, but have not paid as primary, pursuant
> to 42 CFR 411.22. A primary plan\'s responsibility for such payment
> may be demonstrated by a judgment, a payment conditioned upon the
> recipient\'s compromise, waiver, or release (whether or not there is a
> determination or admission of liability) of payment for items and
> services included in a claim against the primary plan or the primary
> plan\'s insured, or by other means.
>
> ***NOTE:** If the injury resulted from an automobile accident and/or
> there is an indication of* primary coverage under a GHP, the provider,
> physician, or other supplier bills the liability insurer or no-fault
> insurer and/ GHP as appropriate before requesting conditional Medicare
> payments. Except as delineated in in Pub.100-05, Chapter 2, Medicare
> does not make conditional primary payment when there is GHP coverage
> that is a primary payer to Medicare until the claim has been sent to

## *- Multiple Insurers*

### *(Rev. 11755, Issued:12-21-22, Effective: 01-23-23, Implementation: 01-23-23)*

A.  ***More Than One Primary Insurer***

> *There may be instances where Medicare is secondary payer to more than
> one primary* insurer (e.g., an individual who is covered under his/her
> own GHP and under the GHP of an employed spouse or under no-fault
> insurance). In such cases, the other primary payers will customarily
> coordinate benefits. If a portion of the charges remains unpaid after
> the other insurers have paid primary benefits, a secondary Medicare
> payment may be made. See 42 CFR § 411.24.
>
> *Coordination of benefits (COB) arrangements between private plans,
> whether based on* State law or private agreements, cannot supersede
> Federal law that makes Medicare secondary payer to certain GHPs for
> individuals and spouses age 65 or over. Therefore, where the
> individual has GHP coverage based on current employment status in
> addition to GHP coverage as a retiree, Medicare is secondary to the
> GHP coverage based on current employment status and primary to the GHP
> coverage based on retirement regardless of the coordination of
> benefits arrangements between the plans.
>
> *Where services are covered in part by WC and also under liability or
> no-fault insurance, or* there is primary coverage by a GHP, Medicare
> is the residual payer only.
>
> *Accordingly, whenever any primary plan pays in part for provider,
> physician, or other* supplier services and the provider, physician, or
> other supplier does not accept, and is not obligated to accept the
> payment as payment in full, the provider, physician, or other supplier
> ensures that a claim is submitted to any other insurer that is primary
> to Medicare.

### *COB Rules Conflict With MSP Rules*

> *COB arrangements between private plans, whether based on State law or
> private* agreements, cannot supersede Federal law that makes Medicare
> secondary payer to GHPs and LGHPs in certain situations. There are two
> scenarios to consider.
>
> *The first scenario is where an individual has dependent GHP coverage
> that is primary to* Medicare (e.g., coverage based on the employment
> of the individual\'s spouse) in addition to nondependent coverage that
> is secondary to Medicare (e.g., coverage based on the individual\'s
> retirement).In this instance, Medicare is secondary to the dependent
> coverage and primary to the nondependent coverage. In other words, the
> dependent coverage pays first and the nondependent coverage pays
> second even though under private COB agreements, the nondependent
> coverage would be expected to pay before the dependent coverage. (See
> example 2 below.)
>
> *The second scenario is where a plan\'s payment would normally be
> secondary to Medicare* but, under COB provisions, the payment is
> primary to a primary payer under
> [[§1862(b)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of the
> Act, the combined payment of both plans constitutes the primary
> payment to which Medicare is a secondary payer. In other words, both
> plans pay first. (See example 1 below.)

### *EXAMPLE 1:*

> *John Jones, age 75, is a Medicare beneficiary with coverage under
> Part A and Part B. He* retired from the Acme Tool Company in 2021 and
> received retirement health insurance coverage that is secondary to
> Medicare. His wife, Mary, age 64, has been employed continuously with
> the local police department since 1977 and since that time has
> received coverage for herself and her husband under the department\'s
> GHP. The priority of payment for John\'s medical expenses is as
> follows:

-   *The GHP will be primary,*

-   *Medicare will be secondary, and*

-   *The retirement plan will be tertiary payer.*

### *EXAMPLE 2:*

> *Chris Thomas, age 67, is a Medicare beneficiary with coverage under
> Part A and Part B.* He has been employed continuously by XYZ Bolt
> Company since 2002 and has GHP coverage through his employer. His
> wife, Ann, age 62, has been retired from the local police department
> since 2015 and received retirement health insurance coverage for
>
> *herself and her husband that is secondary to Medicare. The order of
> payment for Chris\'* medical expenses is as follows:

-   *Chris\'s GHP, based on current employment status is primary payer.*

-   *Medicare is secondary payer.*

-   *The spouse\'s retirement plan is the tertiary payer.-*

> file within CMS to identify MSP occurrences in order to ensure
> accurate Coordination of Benefits. Currently in Chapter 6 of the
> Medicare Secondary Payer Manual, the CWF process as it pertains to MSP
> and Coordination of Benefits is explained. It gives A/B MACs and DME

## *-- MSP Recovery*

### *(Rev. 11755, Issued:12-21-22, Effective: 01-23-23, Implementation: 01-23-23)*

> *The MSP Manual outlines Medicare's right to recover payments it has
> made on behalf* of private insurers that are the primary (or "first")
> payers for Medicare beneficiaries. This information is currently found
> in Chapter 7 of the Medicare Secondary Payer Manual. In situations
> where Medicare is a "secondary" payer, the primary payer must
>
> *reimburse Medicare for any benefits that Medicare has mistakenly paid
> as primary on* behalf of a beneficiary.
>
> *The MSP program ensures that Medicare is aware of situations where it
> should not be* the primary (the first) payer of claims. If a
> beneficiary has Medicare and other health insurance, Medicare COB)
> rules decide which entity pays first. Medicare may make conditional
> payments on behalf of beneficiaries so that beneficiaries can maintain
> continual Medicare coverage throughout the COB period. Any such
> payments are conditioned on reimbursement to the appropriate Medicare
> trust fund.

## 40 - *Referral to the Regional Office*

### *(Rev. 11755, Issued:12-21-22, Effective: 01-23-23, Implementation: 01-23-23)*

> *The term Medicare beneficiary identifier (MBI) is a general term
> describing a* beneficiary\'s Medicare identification number. For
> purposes of this manual, Medicare beneficiary identifier references
> both the Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) and the MBI during the
> new Medicare card transition period and after for certain business
> areas that will continue to use the HICN as part of their processes.
>
> *Since the CMS is responsible for enforcement of the age
> anti-discrimination* provisions for coverage under group health plans,
> all complaints received that may reflect such discrimination by GHPs
> must be treated as possible violations of the Medicare law. This
> includes complaints that a GHP is \"taking into account\" that an
> individual is entitled to Medicare benefits and complaints that a GHP
> is not providing equal benefits under the same conditions for older
> and younger workers and spouses.
>
> *A/B MACs and DME MACs must refer any cases to the RO where a GHP or
> LGHP* is a nonconforming plan. Cases are referred as a result of the
> GHP or LGHP refuses to make payment as the primary payer or performing
> the following actions:

-   *Offers secondary coverage for individuals for whom Medicare is
    secondary; or*

-   *Refuses to reimburse Medicare for any primary benefits paid to, or
    on behalf of, a Medicare beneficiary.*

> *In all potential discrimination cases, the contractor obtains
> documentation of the* alleged discrimination, such as:

-   *A notice from the GHP and/or a copy of the plan policy;*

-   *A written description of the alleged discriminatory action(s) by
    the GHP from the party or parties involved;*

-   *The name and address of the individual\'s employer;*

-   *The individual\'s name and Medicare beneficiary identifier;*

-   *The name and address of the GHP or LGHP;*

-   *The individual\'s group health plan identification number; and*

-   *A full explanation of the reasons for the referral.*

> *All available information concerning the matter must be sent to the
> RO, along with* an analysis of the facts. If the RO believes that the
> GHP may have committed a discriminatory act, the case is referred to
> the Central Office (CO) for facts, for consideration of whether the
> plan is a nonconforming group health plan, (i.e. a group health plan
> which at any time during a calendar year does not comply with the
> anti-discrimination provisions of the Act). The RO considers possible
> legal action to collect double damages from the nonconforming
> LGHP/GHP. The CO also refers nonconforming group health plans to the
> Internal Revenue Service for imposition of an excise tax penalty to
> assure compliance with the anti- discrimination provisions of the law.
>
> *If the GHP, LGHP, or employer has agreed to discontinue offering
> secondary* coverage to Medicare individuals for whom it is primary
> payer or has agreed to reimburse Medicare the amount of incorrect
> Medicare primary benefits that should have been paid by the plan, the
> CO includes this information in its referral.
>
> *Once the CO refers a nonconforming LGHP/GHP to the IRS, it does not
> withdraw* the referral solely because the plan has discontinued
> offering improper secondary coverage or has reimbursed Medicare the
> amount of incorrect primary benefits Medicare paid.
