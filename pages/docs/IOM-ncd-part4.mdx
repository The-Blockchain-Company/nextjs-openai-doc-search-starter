> of bronchodilator drug. They can be administered via nebulizer,
> metered dose inhaler, orally, or dry powdered inhaler.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective April 7, 2022, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
> (CMS) covers Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved monoclonal
> antibodies directed against amyloid for the treatment of AD when
> furnished in accordance with Section B under coverage with evidence
> development (CED) for patients who have a clinical diagnosis of mild
> cognitive impairment
>
> \(MCI\) due to AD or mild AD dementia, both with confirmed presence of
> amyloid beta pathology consistent with AD.
>
> Coverage Criteria:

1)  Monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid that are approved by
    the FDA for the treatment of AD based upon evidence of efficacy from
    a change in a surrogate endpoint (e.g., amyloid reduction)
    considered as reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit may be
    covered in a randomized controlled trial conducted under an
    investigational new drug (IND) application.

2)  Monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid that are approved by
    the FDA for the treatment of AD based upon evidence of efficacy from
    a direct measure of clinical benefit may be covered in CMS-approved
    prospective comparative studies. Study data for CMS-approved
    prospective comparative studies may be collected in a registry.

3)  For CMS-approved studies, the protocol, including the analysis plan,
    must include:

    a.  A study population whose diversity of patients are
        > representative of the national population with MCI due to AD
        > or mild AD dementia.

    b.  A neurocognitive evaluation and a description of the instruments
        > used to assess cognition and function for the clinical
        > diagnosis of MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia for study
        > enrollment and outcomes assessment.

    c.  A description of:

        i.  The multidisciplinary dementia team and optimal medical
            > management.

        ii. Study sites with clinical expertise and infrastructure to
            > provide treatments consistent with the safety monitoring
            > outlined in the FDA-approved label.

4)  CMS-approved studies of a monoclonal antibody directed against
    amyloid (antiamyloid mAb) approved by the FDA for the treatment of
    AD based upon evidence of efficacy from a direct measure of clinical
    benefit must address all of the questions below:

    a.  Does the antiamyloid mAb meaningfully improve health outcomes
        (i.e., slow the decline of cognition and function) for patients
        in broad community practice?

    b.  Do benefits, and harms such as brain hemorrhage and edema,
        associated with use of the antiamyloid mAb, depend on
        characteristics of patients, treating clinicians, and settings?

    c.  How do the benefits and harms change over time?

5)  CMS-approved studies must adhere to the following standards of
    scientific integrity that have been identified by the Agency for
    Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ):

    a.  The principal purpose of the study is to test whether the item
        or service meaningfully improves health outcomes of affected
        beneficiaries who are represented by the enrolled subjects.

    b.  The rationale for the study is well supported by available
        scientific and medical evidence.

    c.  The study results are not anticipated to unjustifiably duplicate
        existing knowledge.

    d.  The study design is methodologically appropriate and the
        anticipated number of enrolled subjects is sufficient to answer
        the research question(s) being asked in the National Coverage
        Determination (NCD).

    e.  The study is sponsored by an organization or individual capable
        of completing it successfully.

    f.  The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal
        regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found in
        the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 45 CFR Part

> 46\. If a study is regulated by the FDA, it is also in compliance with
> 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56. In addition, to further enhance the protection
> of human subjects in studies conducted under CED, the study must
> provide and obtain meaningful informed consent from patients regarding
> the risks associated with the study items and/or services, and the use
> and eventual disposition of the collected data.

g.  All aspects of the study are conducted according to appropriate
    standards of scientific integrity.

h.  The study has a written protocol that clearly demonstrates adherence
    to the standards listed here as Medicare requirements.

i.  The study is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disease
    pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Such studies may meet this
    requirement only if the disease or condition being studied is life
    threatening as defined in 21 CFR §312.81(a) and the patient has no
    other viable treatment options.

j.  The clinical research studies and registries are registered on the
    [www.ClinicalTrials.gov](http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov/) website by
    the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the
    first study subject. Registries are also registered in the AHRQ
    Registry of Patient Registries (RoPR).

k.  The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of
    public release of all prespecified outcomes to be measured including
    release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is terminated
    early. The results must be made public within 12 months of the
    study's primary completion date, which is the date the final subject
    had final data collection for the primary endpoint, even if the
    trial does not achieve its primary aim. The results must include
    number started/completed, summary results for primary and secondary
    outcome measures, statistical analyses, and adverse events. Final
    results must be reported in a publicly accessible manner; either in
    a peer-reviewed scientific journal (in print or on-line), in an
    on-line publicly accessible registry dedicated to the dissemination
    of clinical trial information such as ClinicalTrials.gov, or in
    journals willing to publish in abbreviated format (e.g., for studies
    with negative or incomplete results).

l.  The study protocol must explicitly discuss beneficiary
    subpopulations affected by the item or service under investigation,
    particularly traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical
    studies, how the inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment
    of these populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of
    said populations in the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion
    criteria are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment
    or retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must
    discuss why these criteria are necessary.

m.  The study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are or are
    not expected to be generalizable to affected beneficiary
    subpopulations. Separate discussions in the protocol may be
    necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age,
    disability or Medicaid eligibility.

## General

> Sections 1861(s)(2)(R) and 1861(pp) of the Social Security Act (the
> Act) and regulations at 42 CFR 410.37 authorize Medicare coverage for
> screening colorectal cancer tests under Medicare Part B. The statute

> consultation with appropriate organizations.

B.  ## Nationally Covered Indications

    1.  **Fecal Occult Blood Tests (FOBT) (effective January 1, 2004)**

> Fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) are generally divided into two types:
> immunoassay and guaiac types. Immunoassay (or immunochemical) fecal
> occult blood tests (iFOBT) use "antibodies directed against human
> globin epitopes. While most iFOBTs use spatulas to collect stool
> samples, some use a brush to collect toilet water surrounding the
> stool. Most iFOBTs require laboratory processing.
>
> Guaiac fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT) use a peroxidase reaction to
> indicate presence of the heme portion of hemoglobin. Guaiac turns blue
> after oxidation by oxidants or peroxidases in the presence of an
> oxygen donor such as hydrogen peroxide. Most
>
> FOBTs use sticks to collect stool samples and may be developed in a
> physician's office or a laboratory. In 1998, Medicare began
> reimbursement for guaiac FOBTs, but not immunoassay type tests for
> colorectal cancer screening. Since the fundamental process is similar
> for other iFOBTs, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
> evaluated colorectal cancer screening using immunoassay FOBTs in
> general.
>
> Effective for dates of service on and after January 1, 2004, Medicare
> covers one screening FOBT per annum for the early detection of
> colorectal cancer. This means that Medicare will cover one gFOBT or
> one iFOBT at a frequency of every 12 months; i.e., at least 11 months
> have passed following the month in which the last covered screening
> FOBT was performed, for beneficiaries aged 50 years and older. The
> beneficiary completes the existing gFOBT by taking samples from two
> different sites of three consecutive stools; the beneficiary completes
> the iFOBT by taking the appropriate number of stool samples according
> to the specific manufacturer's instructions. This screening requires a
> written order from the beneficiary's attending physician. ("Attending
> physician" means a doctor of medicine or osteopathy (as defined in
> §1861(r)(1) of the Act) who is fully knowledgeable about the
> beneficiary's medical condition, and who would be responsible for
> using the results of any examination performed in the overall
> management of the beneficiary's specific medical problem.)
>
> *Effective January 1, 2023, the minimum age for FOBT is reduced to 45
> years and older.*

## The CologuardTM -- Multi-target Stool DNA (sDNA) Test (effective October 9, 2014)

> Screening stool or fecal DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, sDNA) testing
> detects molecular markers of altered DNA that are contained in the
> cells shed by colorectal cancer and pre- malignant colorectal
> epithelial neoplasia into the lumen of the large bowel. Through the
> use of selective enrichment and amplification techniques, sDNA tests
> are designed to detect very small amounts of DNA markers to identify
> colorectal cancer or pre-malignant colorectal neoplasia. The
> Cologuard^TM^ -- multi-target sDNA test is a proprietary in vitro
> diagnostic device that incorporates both sDNA and fecal immunochemical
> test techniques and is designed to analyze patients' stool samples for
> markers associated with the presence of colorectal cancer and
> pre-malignant colorectal neoplasia.
>
> Effective for dates of service on or after October 9, 2014, The
> Cologuard™ test is covered once every three years for Medicare
> beneficiaries that meet all of the following criteria:

-   Age 50 to 85 years, and,

-   Asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of colorectal disease including
    > but not limited to lower gastrointestinal pain, blood in stool,
    > positive guaiac fecal

> occult blood test (gFOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (iFOBT)), and,

-   At average risk of developing colorectal cancer (no personal history
    > of adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel
    > disease, including Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis; no
    > family history of colorectal cancers or adenomatous polyps,
    > familial adenomatous polyposis, or hereditary nonpolyposis
    > colorectal cancer).

## (Rev.202, Issued: 08- 25-17, Effective: 09-26-17, Implementation: 09- 26-17)

A.  **General**

> Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable morbidity and
> mortality in the U.S. and is a major contributor to the nation's
> increasing medical costs. Despite the growing list of adverse health
> effects associated with smoking, more than 45 million U.S. adults
> continue to smoke and approximately 1,200 die prematurely each day
> from tobacco-related diseases. Annual smoking- attributable
> expenditures can be measured both in direct medical costs (\$96
> billion) and in lost productivity (\$97 billion), but the results of
> national surveys have raised concerns that recent declines in smoking
> prevalence among U.S. adults may have come to an end. According to the
>
> U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Public Health
> Service (PHS) Clinical Practice Guideline on Treating Tobacco Use and
> Dependence (2008), 4.5 million adults over 65 years of age smoke
> cigarettes. Even smokers over age 65, however, can benefit greatly
> from abstinence, and older smokers who quit can reduce their risk of
> death from coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease
> and lung cancer, as well as decrease their risk of osteoporosis.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective for claims with dates of service on or after August 25,
> 2010, CMS will cover tobacco cessation counseling for outpatient and
> hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries

1.  Who use tobacco, regardless of whether they have signs or symptoms
    of tobacco-related disease;

2.  Who are competent and alert at the time that counseling is provided;
    and,

3.  Whose counseling is furnished by a qualified physician or other
    Medicare-recognized practitioner.

> Intermediate and intensive smoking cessation counseling services will
> be covered under Medicare Part B when the above conditions of coverage
> are met, subject to frequency and other limitations. That is, similar
> to existing tobacco cessation counseling for symptomatic individuals,
> CMS will allow 2 individual tobacco cessation counseling attempts per
> 12-month period. Each attempt may include a maximum of 4 intermediate
> OR intensive sessions, with a total benefit covering up to 8 sessions
> per 12-month period per Medicare beneficiary who uses tobacco. The
> practitioner and patient have the flexibility to choose between
> intermediate (more than 3 minutes but less than 10 minutes), or
> intensive (more than 10 minutes) cessation counseling sessions for
> each attempt.

## Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> Inpatient hospital stays with the principal diagnosis of tobacco use
> disorder are not reasonable and necessary for the effective delivery
> of tobacco cessation counseling services. Therefore, we will not cover
> tobacco cessation services if tobacco cessation is the primary reason
> for the patient's hospital stay.

## Other

> Section 4104 of the Affordable Care Act provided for a waiver of the
> Medicare coinsurance and Part B deductible requirements for this

> 10- 02- 17, October**
>
> **2, 2017 - analysis and design; January 2, 2018 - testing and
> implementation)**

A.  **General**

> Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is transmitted by exposure to blood or
> blood-containing body fluids such as serum, semen or saliva. HBV
> infection attacks the liver and leads to inflammation. An infected
> person may initially develop symptoms such as nausea, anorexia,
> fatigue, fever and abdominal pain, or may be asymptomatic. An acute
> HBV infection may become a chronic infection and progress to serious
> and potentially life-threatening complications including cirrhosis,
> liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma and death.
>
> Pursuant to §1861(ddd) of the Social Security Act, the Secretary may
> add coverage of
>
> \"additional preventive services\" if certain statutory requirements
> are met.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective for services performed on or after September 28, 2016, CMS
> has determined that the evidence is sufficient to cover screening for
> HBV infection with the appropriate U.S. Food and Drug Administration
> (FDA) approved/cleared laboratory tests, used consistent with FDA
> approved labeling and in compliance with the Clinical Laboratory
> Improvement Act (CLIA) regulations, when ordered by the beneficiary\'s
> primary care physician or practitioner within the context of a primary
> care setting, and performed by an eligible Medicare provider for these
> services, for beneficiaries who meet either of the following
> conditions.

1.  A screening test is covered for asymptomatic, nonpregnant
    > adolescents and adults at high risk for HBV infection. \"High
    > risk\" is defined as persons born in countries and regions with a
    > high prevalence of HBV infection (i.e., ≥ 2%), US­born persons not
    > vaccinated as infants whose parents were born in regions with a
    > very high prevalence of HBV infection (i.e., ≥ 8%), HIV­positive
    > persons, men who have sex with men, injection drug users,
    > household contacts or sexual partners of persons with HBV
    > infection. In addition, CMS has determined that repeated screening
    > would be appropriate annually only for beneficiaries with
    > continued high risk (i.e., men who have sex with men, injection
    > drug users, household contacts or sexual partners of persons with
    > HBV infection) who do not receive hepatitis B vaccination.

2.  A screening test at the first prenatal visit is covered for pregnant
    > women and then rescreening at time of delivery for those with new
    > or continuing risk factors. In addition, CMS has determined that
    > screening during the first prenatal visit would be appropriate for

# -- Screening for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)

## (Rev. 190, Issued: 02-05-16; Effective: 04-13-15; Implementation: 03-07-16 - non-shared A/B MAC edits; 07-05-16 - CWF analysis and design; 10-03-16 - CWF Coding, Testing and Implementation, MCS, and FISS Implementation; 01-03-17 - Requirement 9403.04.9)

A.  **General**

> Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is an infection caused by a
> retrovirus that affects the immune system. HIV infection causes
> acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a disease which severely
> compromises an individual's immune system. It is currently generally
> accepted that antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly reduced
> HIV-associated morbidity and mortality throughout the world and the
> United States, and has transformed HIV disease for many, into a
> chronic, manageable condition. There is also evidence that the use of
> ART is associated with a substantially decreased risk for transmission
> of the virus to uninfected persons.
>
> Effective January 1, 2009, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
> Services (CMS) is allowed to add coverage of "additional preventive
> services" through the national coverage determination (NCD) process if
> certain statutory requirements are met, as provided in 42 C.F.R.
> §410.64 (CMS began covering HIV screening effective December 8, 2009).
> One of those requirements is that the service(s) be categorized as a
> Grade A (strongly recommends) or Grade B (recommends)
>
> rating by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).
> The USPSTF gives a Grade A recommendation to screening for HIV in:

-   All adolescents and adults between the ages of 15 to 65 years,

-   Younger adolescents and older adults who are at increased risk of
    > HIV infection, and,

-   All pregnant women.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective for claims with dates of service on and after April 13,
> 2015, CMS has determined that the evidence is adequate to conclude
> that screening for HIV infection for all individuals between the ages
> of 15 and 65 years, as recommended with a Grade of A by the USPSTF, is
> reasonable and necessary for early detection of HIV and is appropriate
> for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under
> Part B.
>
> CMS shall cover screening for HIV with the appropriate U.S. Food and
> Drug Administration (FDA)-approved laboratory tests and point-of-care
> tests, used consistent with FDA-approved labeling and in compliance
> with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) regulations, when
> ordered by the beneficiary's physician or practitioner within the
> context of a healthcare setting and performed by an eligible Medicare
> provider for these services, for beneficiaries who meet one of the
> following conditions:

1.  Except for pregnant Medicare beneficiaries addressed below, a
    maximum of one, annual, voluntary screening for all adolescents and
    adults between the age of 15 and 65, without regard to perceived
    risk.

2.  Except for pregnant Medicare beneficiaries addressed below, a
    maximum of one, annual, voluntary screening for adolescents younger
    than 15 and adults older than 65 who are at increased risk for HIV
    infection. Increased risk for HIV infection is defined as follows:

> Men who have sex with men,
>
> Men and women having unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse,

-   Past or present injection drug users,

-   Men and women who exchange sex for money or drugs, or have sex
    > partners who do,

-   Individuals whose past or present sex partners were HIV-infected,
    > bisexual, or injection drug users,

-   Persons who have acquired or request testing for other sexually
    > transmitted infectious diseases,

-   Persons with a history of blood transfusions between 1978 and 1985,

-   Persons who request an HIV test despite reporting no individual risk
    > factors, Persons with new sexual partners,

-   Persons who, based on individualized physician interview and
    > examination, are deemed to be at increased risk for HIV infection.
    > The determination of "increased risk" for HIV infection is
    > identified by the health care practitioner who assesses the
    > patient's history, which is part of any complete medical history,
    > typically part of an annual wellness visit

> and considered in the development of a comprehensive prevention plan.
> The medical recommendation should be a reflection of the service
> provided.

1.  A maximum of three, voluntary, HIV screenings of pregnant Medicare
    beneficiaries: (1) when the diagnosis of pregnancy is known, (2)
    during the third trimester, and, (3) at labor, if ordered by the
    woman's clinician.

## Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> Effective for claims with dates of service on and after April 13,
> 2015:
>
> -Medicare beneficiaries with any known diagnosis of an HIV-related
> illness are not eligible for this screening test.
>
> -Medicare beneficiaries between the ages of 15 and 65 who have had a

a.  Medicare Part B pays for additional preventive services not
    described in paragraph (1) or (3) of the definition of "preventive
    services" under §410.2, that identify medical conditions or risk
    factors for individuals if the Secretary determines through the
    national coverage determination process (as defined in section
    1869(f)(1)(B) of the Act) that these services are all of the
    following: (1) reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early
    detection of illness or disability.(2) recommended with a grade of A
    or B by the United States Preventive Services Task Force, (3)
    appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or
    enrolled under Part B.

b.  In making determinations under paragraph (a) of this section
    regarding the coverage of a new preventive service, the Secretary
    may conduct an assessment of the relation between predicted outcomes
    and the expenditures for such services and may take into account the
    results of such an assessment in making such national coverage
    determinations.

    non-pregnant women who are at increased risk,

-   Screening for chlamydial infection for all pregnant women aged 24
    and younger and for older pregnant women who are at increased risk,

-   Screening for gonorrhea infection in all sexually active women,
    including those who are pregnant, if they are at increased risk,

-   Screening for syphilis infection for all pregnant women and for all
    persons at increased risk,

-   Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in pregnant women at
    their first prenatal visit,

-   HIBC for the prevention of STIs for all sexually active adolescents,

## (Rev. 142, issued: 02-03-12, Effective: 11-29-11, Implementation: 03-06-12)

A.  **General**

> Based upon authority to cover "additional preventive services" for
> Medicare beneficiaries if certain statutory requirements are met, the
> Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated a new
> national coverage analysis on intensive behavioral therapy for
> obesity. Screening for obesity in adults is recommended with a grade
> of B by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and is
> appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A and Part
> B.
>
> The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that "obesity rates in
> the U.S. have increased dramatically over the last 30 years, and
> obesity is now epidemic in the United States." In the Medicare
> population over 30% of men and women are obese. Obesity is directly or
> indirectly associated with many chronic diseases including
> cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal conditions and diabetes.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective for claims with dates of service on or after November 29,
> 2011, CMS covers intensive behavioral therapy for obesity, defined as
> a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m^2^, for the prevention or early
> detection of illness or disability.
>
> Intensive behavioral therapy for obesity consists of the following:

1.  Screening for obesity in adults using measurement of BMI calculated
    > by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters
    > (expressed kg/m^2^);

2.  Dietary (nutritional) assessment; and

3.  Intensive behavioral counseling and behavioral therapy to promote
    > sustained weight loss through high intensity interventions on diet
    > and exercise.

> The intensive behavioral intervention for obesity should be consistent
> with the 5-A framework that has been highlighted by the USPSTF:

1.  **Assess**: Ask about/assess behavioral health risk(s) and factors
    > affecting choice of behavior change goals/methods.

# -- Screening for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in Adults

## (Rev. 177, Issued: 11-19-14, Effective: 06-02-14, Implementation: 01-05-15 - For non- shared MAC edits and CWF analysis; 04-06-15 - For remaining shared systems edits)

A.  General

> Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is an infection that attacks the liver and
> leads to inflammation. The infection is often asymptomatic and can go
> undiagnosed for decades. It is difficult for the human immune system
> to eliminate the HCV and it is a major cause of chronic liver disease.
> The
>
> presence of HCV in the liver initiates a response from the immune
> system which in turn causes inflammation. Inflammation over long
> periods of time (usually decades) can cause scarring, called
> cirrhosis. A cirrhotic liver fails to perform the normal functions of
> the liver which leads to liver failure. Cirrhotic livers are more
> prone to become cancerous and liver failure leads to serious
> complications, even death. HCV is reported to be the leading cause of
> chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer and a primary indication
> for liver transplant in the Western World.
>
> Under §1861(ddd) of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Centers for
> Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has the authority to add coverage
> of additional preventive services if certain statutory requirements
> are met. The regulations provide:
>
> 42 CFR §410.64 Additional preventive services

(a) Medicare Part B pays for additional preventive services not
    described in paragraph (1) or

> \(3\) of the definition of "preventive services" under 42 CFR §410.2,
> that identify medical conditions or risk factors for individuals if
> the Secretary determines through the national coverage determination
> process (as defined in section 1869(f)(1)(B) of the Act) that these
> services are all of the following: (1) reasonable and necessary for
> the prevention or early detection of illness or disability,(2)
> recommended with a grade of A or B by the United States Preventive
> Services Task Force (USPSTF), (3) appropriate for individuals entitled
> to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B.

(b) In making determinations under paragraph (a) of this section
    regarding the coverage of a new preventive service, the Secretary
    may conduct an assessment of the relation between predicted outcomes
    and the expenditures for such services and may take into account the
    results of such an assessment in making such national coverage
    determinations.

> The scope of the review for this national coverage determination (NCD)
> evaluated and determined if the existing body of evidence was
> sufficient for Medicare coverage for screening for HCV in adults at
> high risk for HCV infection and one-time screening for HCV infection
> for adults born between 1945 and 1965, which is recommended with a
> grade B by the USPSTF.

B.  Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective for services performed on or after June 2, 2014, CMS has
> determined the following:
>
> The evidence is adequate to conclude that screening for HCV,
> consistent with the grade B recommendations by the USPSTF, is
> reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of an
> illness or disability and is appropriate for individuals entitled to
> benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B, as described below.
>
> Therefore, CMS will cover screening for HCV with the appropriate U.S.
> Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved/cleared laboratory tests,
> used consistent with FDA-approved labeling and in compliance with the
> Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act regulations, when ordered by the
> beneficiary's primary care physician or practitioner within the
> context of a
>
> primary care setting, and performed by an eligible Medicare provider
> for these services, for beneficiaries who meet either of the following
> conditions:

1.  A screening test is covered for adults at high risk for HCV
    infection. "High risk" is defined as persons with a current or past
    history of illicit injection drug use; and persons who have a
    history of receiving a blood transfusion prior to 1992. Repeat
    screening for high risk persons is covered annually only for persons
    who have had continued illicit injection drug use since the prior
    negative screening test.

2.  A single screening test is covered for adults who do not meet the
    high risk definition above, but who were born from 1945 through
    1965.

> The determination of "high risk for HCV" is identified by the primary
> care physician or practitioner who assesses the patient's history,
> which is part of any complete medical history, typically part of an
> annual wellness visit and considered in the development of a
> comprehensive prevention plan. The medical record should be a
> reflection of the service provided.
>
> A primary care setting is defined by the provision of integrated,
> accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for
> addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing
> a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context
> of family and community. Emergency departments, inpatient hospital
> settings, ambulatory surgical centers, independent diagnostic testing
> facilities, skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation
> facilities, clinics providing a limited focus of health care services,
> and hospice are examples of settings not considered primary care

A.  **General**

> Diagnostic examinations of the head (head scans) and of other parts of
> the body (body scans) performed by computerized tomography (CT)
> scanners are covered if medical and scientific literature and opinion
> support the effective use of a scan for the condition, and the scan

>
> The CT scans have become the primary diagnostic tool for many
> conditions and symptoms. CT scanning used as the primary diagnostic
> tool can be cost effective because it can eliminate the need for a

## Determining Whether a CT Scan Is Reasonable and Necessary

> Sufficient information must be provided with claims to differentiate
> CT scans from other radiology services and to make coverage
> determinations. Carefully review claims to ensure that a scan is
> reasonable and necessary for the individual patient; i.e., the use
> must be found to be medically appropriate considering the patient's

> There is no general rule that requires other diagnostic tests to be
> tried before CT scanning is used. However, in an individual case the
> A/B MAC (A) or (B) medical staff may determine that use of a CT scan
> as the initial diagnostic test was not reasonable and necessary
> because it was not supported by the patient's symptoms or complaints
> stated on the claim form; e.g., "periodic headaches.\"
>
> Claims for CT scans are reviewed for evidence of abuse, which might
> include the absence of reasonable indications for the scans, an
> excessive number of scans, or unnecessarily expensive types of scans
> considering the facts in the particular cases.

C.  ## Approved Models of CT Equipment

    1.  **Criteria for Approval**

> In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the A/B MAC (A) or (B) may
> assume that a CT scan for which payment is requested has been
> performed on equipment that meets the following criteria:

a.  The model must be known to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
    > and

b.  Must be in the full market release phase of development.

> Should it be necessary to confirm that those criteria are met, ask the
> manufacturer to submit the information in C.2. If manufacturers
> inquire about obtaining Medicare approval for their equipment, inform
> them of the foregoing criteria.

2.  ## Evidence of Approval

    a.  The letter sent by the Bureau of Radiological Health, FDA, to
        > the manufacturer acknowledging the FDA's receipt of
        > information on the specific CT scanner system model submitted
        > as required under Public Law 90-602, "The Radiation Control
        > for Health and Safety Act of 1968.\"

    b.  A letter signed by the chief executive officer or other officer
        > acting in a similar capacity for the manufacturer which:

        i.  . Furnishes the CT scanner system model number, all names
            > that hospitals and physicians' offices may use to refer to
            > the CT scanner system on claims, and the accession number
            > assigned by FDA to the specific model;

        ii. Specifies whether the scanner performs head scans only, body
            > scans only (i.e., scans of parts of the body other than
            > the head), or head and body scans;

        iii. States that the company or corporation is satisfied with
             > the results of the developmental stages that preceded the
             > full market release phase of the equipment, that the
             > equipment is in the full market release phase, and the
             > date on which it was decided to put the product into the
             > full market release phase.

## Mobile CT Equipment

> CT scans performed on mobile units are subject to the same Medicare
> coverage requirements applicable to scans performed on stationary
> units, as well as certain health and safety requirements recommended
> by the Health Resources and Services Administration. As with scans
> performed on stationary units, the scans must be determined medically
> necessary for the individual patient. The scans must be performed on
> types of CT scanning equipment that have been approved for use as
> stationary units (see C above), and must be in compliance with
> applicable State laws and regulations for control of radiation.

## Hospital Setting

> The hospital must assume responsibility for the quality of the scan
> furnished to inpatients and outpatients and must ensure that a
> radiologist or other qualified physician is in charge of the
> procedure. The radiologist or other physician (i.e., one who is with
> the mobile unit) who is responsible for the procedure must be approved
> by the hospital for similar privileges.

## Ambulatory Setting

> If mobile CT scan services are furnished at an ambulatory health care
> facility other than a hospital-based facility, e.g., a freestanding
> physician-directed clinic, the diagnostic procedure must be performed
> by, or under the direct personal supervision of, a radiologist or
> other qualified physician. In addition, the facility must maintain a
> record of the attending physician's order for a scan performed on a
> mobile unit.

## Billing for Mobile CT Scans

> Hospitals, hospital-associated radiologists, ambulatory health care
> facilities, and physician owner/operators of mobile units may bill for
> mobile scans as they would for scans performed on stationary
> equipment.

## Claims Review

> Evidence of compliance with applicable State laws and regulations for
> control of radiation should be requested from owners of mobile CT scan
> units upon receipt of the first claims. All mobile scan claims should
> be reviewed very carefully in accordance with instructions applicable
> to scans performed on fixed units, with particular emphasis on the
> medical necessity for scans performed in an ambulatory setting.

## Multi-Planar Diagnostic Imaging (MPDI)

> In usual CT scanning procedures, a series of transverse or axial
> images are reproduced. These transverse images are routinely
> translated into coronal and/or sagittal views. MPDI is a process which
> further translates the data produced by CT scanning by providing
> reconstructed oblique images which can contribute to diagnostic
> information. MPDI, also known as planar image reconstruction or
> reformatted imaging, is covered under Medicare when provided as a
> service to an entity performing a covered CT scan.

A.  ## General

    1.  **Method of Operation**

> Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), formerly called nuclear magnetic
> resonance (NMR), is a non-invasive method of graphically representing
> the distribution of water and other hydrogen- rich molecules in the
> human body. In contrast to conventional radiographs or computed
> tomography (CT) scans, in which the image is produced by x-ray beam
> attenuation by an object, MRI is capable of producing images by
> several techniques. In fact, various combinations of MRI image
> production methods may be employed to emphasize particular
> characteristics of the tissue or body part being examined. The basic
> elements by which MRI produces an image are the density of hydrogen
> nuclei in the object being examined, their motion, and the relaxation
> times, and the period of time required for the nuclei to return to
> their original states in the main, static magnetic field after being
> subjected to a brief additional magnetic field. These relaxation times
> reflect the physical-chemical properties of tissue and the molecular
> environment of its hydrogen nuclei. Only hydrogen atoms are present in
> human tissues in sufficient concentration for current use in clinical
> MRI.
>
> Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is a non-invasive diagnostic test
> that is an application of MRI. By analyzing the amount of energy
> released from tissues exposed to a strong magnetic field, MRA provides
> images of normal and diseased blood vessels, as well as visualization
> and quantification of blood flow through these vessels.

## General Clinical Utility

> Overall, MRI is a useful diagnostic imaging modality that is capable
> of demonstrating a wide variety of soft-tissue lesions with contrast
> resolution equal or superior to CT scanning in various parts of the
> body.
>
> Among the advantages of MRI are the absence of ionizing radiation and
> the ability to achieve high levels of tissue contrast resolution
> without injected iodinated radiological contrast agents. Recent
> advances in technology have resulted in development and Food and Drug
> Administration (FDA) approval of new paramagnetic contrast agents for
> MRI which allow even better visualization in some instances.

B.  **Nationally Covered MRI and MRA Indications**

    1.  **MRI**

> Although several uses of MRI are still considered investigational and
> some uses are clearly contraindicated (see subsection C), MRI is
> considered medically efficacious for a number of uses. Use the
> following descriptions as general guidelines or examples of what may
> be considered covered rather than as a restrictive list of specific
> covered indications. Coverage is limited to MRI units that have
> received FDA premarket approval, and such units must be operated
> within the parameters specified by the approval. In addition, the
> services must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or
> treatment of the specific patient involved.

a.  Effective November 22, 1985, MRI is useful in examining the head,
    central nervous system, and spine. Multiple sclerosis can be
    diagnosed with MRI and the contents of the posterior fossa are
    visible. The inherent tissue contrast resolution of MRI makes it an
    appropriate standard diagnostic modality for general neuroradiology.

b.  Effective November 22, 1985, MRI can assist in the differential
    diagnosis of mediastinal and retroperitoneal masses, including
    abnormalities of the large vessels such as aneurysms and dissection.
    When a clinical need exists to visualize the parenchyma of solid
    organs to detect anatomic disruption or neoplasia, this can be
    accomplished in the liver, urogenital system, adrenals, and pelvic
    organs without the use of radiological contrast materials. When MRI
    is considered reasonable and necessary, the use of paramagnetic
    contrast materials may be covered as part of the study. MRI may also
    be used to detect and stage pelvic and retroperitoneal neoplasms and
    to evaluate disorders of cancellous bone and soft tissues. It may
    also be used in the detection of pericardial thickening. Primary and
    secondary bone neoplasm and aseptic necrosis can be detected at an
    early stage and monitored with MRI. Patients with metallic
    prostheses, especially of the hip, can be imaged in order to detect
    the early stages of infection of the bone to which the prosthesis is
    attached.

c.  Effective March 22, 1994, MRI may also be covered to diagnose disc
    disease without regard to whether radiological imaging has been
    tried first to diagnose the problem.

d.  Effective March 4, 1991, MRI with gating devices and surface coils,
    > and gating devices that eliminate distorted images caused by
    > cardiac and respiratory movement cycles are now considered state
    > of the art techniques and may be covered. Surface and other
    > specialty coils may also be covered, as they are used routinely
    > for high resolution imaging where small limited regions of the
    > body are studied. They produce high signal- to-noise ratios
    > resulting in images of enhanced anatomic detail.

## MRA (MRI for Blood Flow)

> Currently covered indications include using MRA for specific
> conditions to evaluate flow in internal carotid vessels of the head
> and neck, peripheral arteries of lower extremities, abdomen and
> pelvis, and the chest. Coverage is limited to MRA units that have
> received FDA premarket approval, and such units must be operated
> within the parameters specified by the approval. In addition, the
> services must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or
> treatment of the specific patient involved.

a.  Head and Neck

> Effective April 15, 2003, studies have proven that MRA is effective
> for evaluating flow in internal carotid vessels of the head and neck.
> However, not all potential applications of MRA have been shown to be
> reasonable and necessary. All of the following criteria must apply in
> order for Medicare to provide coverage for MRA of the head and neck:

-   MRA is used to evaluate the carotid arteries, the circle of Willis,
    > the anterior, middle or posterior cerebral arteries, the vertebral
    > or basilar arteries or the venous sinuses;

-   MRA is performed on patients with conditions of the head and neck
    > for which surgery is anticipated and may be found to be
    > appropriate based on the MRA. These conditions include, but are
    > not limited to, tumor, aneurysms, vascular malformations, vascular
    > occlusion or thrombosis. Within this broad category of disorders,
    > medical necessity is the underlying determinant of the need for an
    > MRA in specific diseases. The medical records should clearly
    > justify and demonstrate the existence of medical necessity; and

-   MRA and CA are not expected to be performed on the same patient for
    > diagnostic purposes prior to the application of anticipated
    > therapy. Only one of these tests will be covered routinely unless
    > the physician can demonstrate the medical need to perform both
    > tests.

b.  Peripheral Arteries of Lower Extremities

> Effective April 15, 2003, studies have proven that MRA of peripheral
> arteries is useful in determining the presence and extent of
> peripheral vascular disease in lower extremities. This procedure is
> non-invasive and has been shown to find occult vessels in some
> patients for which those vessels were not apparent when CA was
> performed. Medicare will cover either
>
> MRA or CA to evaluate peripheral arteries of the lower extremities.
> However, both MRA and CA may be useful in some cases, such as:

-   A patient has had CA and this test was unable to identify a viable
    > run-off vessel for bypass. When exploratory surgery is not
    > believed to be a reasonable medical course of action for this
    > patient, MRA may be performed to identify the viable runoff
    > vessel; or

-   A patient has had MRA, but the results are inconclusive.

c.  Abdomen and Pelvis

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
i.  Pre-operative Evaluation of Patients Undergoing Elective Abdominal
    > Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Repair

> Effective July 1, 1999, MRA is covered for pre-operative evaluation of
> patients undergoing elective AAA repair if the scientific evidence
> reveals MRA is considered comparable to CA in determining the extent
> of AAA, as well as in evaluating aortoiliac occlusion disease and
> renal artery pathology that may be necessary in the surgical planning
> of AAA repair. These studies also reveal that MRA could provide a net
> benefit to the patient. If preoperative CA is avoided, then patients
> are not exposed to the risks associated with invasive procedures,
> contrast media, end-organ damage, or arterial injury.

ii. Imaging the Renal Arteries and the Aortoiliac Arteries in the
    > Absence of AAA or Aortic Dissection

> Effective July 1, 2003, MRA coverage is expanded to include imaging
> the renal arteries and the aortoiliac arteries in the absence of AAA
> or aortic dissection. MRA should be obtained in those circumstances in
> which using MRA is expected to avoid obtaining CA, when physician
> history, physical examination, and standard assessment tools provide
> insufficient information for patient management, and obtaining an MRA
> has a high probability of positively affecting patient management.
> However, CA may be ordered after obtaining the results of an MRA in
> those rare instances where medical necessity is demonstrated.

a.  Chest

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
i.  Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism

> Current scientific data has shown that diagnostic pulmonary MRAs are
> improving due to recent developments such as faster imaging
> capabilities and gadolinium- enhancement. However, these advances in
> MRA are not significant enough to warrant replacement of pulmonary
> angiography in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism for patients who
> have no contraindication to receiving intravenous iodinated contrast
> material. Patients who are allergic to iodinated contrast material
> face a high risk of
>
> developing complications if they undergo pulmonary angiography or
> computed tomography angiography. Therefore, Medicare will cover MRA of
> the chest for diagnosing a suspected pulmonary embolism when it is
> contraindicated for the patient to receive intravascular iodinated
> contrast material.

ii. Evaluation of Thoracic Aortic Dissection and Aneurysm

> Studies have shown that MRA of the chest has a high level of
> diagnostic accuracy for pre-operative and post-operative evaluation of
> aortic dissection of aneurysm. Depending on the clinical presentation,
> MRA may be used as an alternative to other non-invasive imaging
> technologies, such as transesophageal echocardiography and CT.
> Generally, Medicare will provide coverage only for MRA or for CA when
> used as a diagnostic test. However, if both MRA and CA of the chest
> are used, the physician must demonstrate the medical need for
> performing these tests.
>
> While the intent of this policy is to provide reimbursement for either
> RA or CA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is also
> allowing flexibility for physicians to make appropriate decisions
> concerning the use of these tests based on the needs of individual
> patients. CMS anticipates, however, low utilization of the combined
> use of MRA and CA. As a result, CMS encourages the Medicare
> Administrative Contractors (MACs) to monitor the use of these tests
> and, where indicated, require evidence of the need to perform both MRA
> and CA.

C.  ## Contraindications and Nationally Non-Covered Indications

    1.  **Contraindications**

> The MRI is not covered when the following patient-specific
> contraindications are present:
>
> MRI is not covered for patients with cardiac pacemakers or with
> metallic clips on vascular aneurysms unless the Medicare beneficiary
> meets the provisions of the following exceptions:
>
> Effective July 7, 2011, the contraindications will not apply to
> pacemakers when used according to the FDA-approved labeling in an MRI
> environment, or
>
> Effective February 24, 2011, CMS believes that the evidence is
> promising although not yet convincing that MRI will improve patient
> health outcomes if certain safeguards are in place to ensure that the
> exposure of the device to an MRI environment adversely affects neither
> the interpretation of the MRI result nor the proper functioning of the
> implanted device itself. We believe that specific precautions (as
> listed below) could maximize benefits of MRI exposure for
> beneficiaries enrolled in clinical trials designed to assess the
> utility and safety of MRI exposure. Therefore, CMS determines that MRI
> will be covered by Medicare when provided in a clinical study under
> section 1862(a)(1)(E) (consistent with section 1142 of the Social
> Security Act (the Act)) through the Coverage with Study Participation
> (CSP) form of Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) if the study
> meets the criteria in each of the three paragraphs below:
>
> The approved prospective clinical study of MRI must, with appropriate
> methodology, address one or more aspects of the following questions:

1.  Do results of MRI in implanted permanent pacemaker (PM)/implantable
    cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) beneficiaries with implanted
    cardiac devices affect physician decision making related to:

    a.  Clinical management strategy (e.g., in oncology, toward
        > palliative or curative care)?

    b.  Planning of treatment interventions?; or

    c.  Prevention of unneeded diagnostic studies or interventions, or
        > preventable exposures?

2.  Do results of MRI in PM/ICD beneficiaries with implanted cardiac
    devices affect patient outcomes related to:

    a.  Survival?

    b.  Quality of life?; or

    c.  Adverse events during and after MR scanning?

> In addition, the prospective clinical study of MRI must include safety
> criteria for all participants. Such required safety measures for such
> studies, as further explained in guidance documents from professional
> societies must include, but are not limited to:

1.  MRI should be done on a case-by-case and site-by-site basis.

2.  MRI scan sequences, field intensity, and field(s) of exposure should
    be selected to minimize risk to the patient while gaining needed
    diagnostic information for diagnosis or for managing therapy.

3.  MRI scanning should be done only if the site is staffed with
    individuals with the appropriate radiology and cardiology knowledge
    and expertise on hand.

4.  Implanted device patients who are candidates for recruitment for an
    MRI clinical study should be advised that life-threatening
    arrhythmias might occur during MRI and serious device malfunction
    might occur, requiring replacement of the device.

5.  Radiology and cardiology personnel and a fully stocked crash cart
    should be readily available throughout the procedure in case a
    significant arrhythmia develops during the examination that does not
    terminate with the cessation of the MRI study. The cardiologist
    should be familiar with the patient's arrhythmia history and the
    implanted device. A programmer that can be used to adjust the device
    as necessary should be readily available.

6.  All such patients should be actively monitored for cardiac and
    respiratory function throughout the examination. At a minimum, ECG
    and pulse oximetry should be used. Visual and verbal contact with
    the patient must be maintained throughout the MRI scan. The patient
    should be instructed to alert the MRI staff on hand to any unusual
    sensations, pains, or to any problems.

7.  At the conclusion of the examination, the cardiologist should
    examine the device to confirm that the function is consistent with
    its pre-examination state.

8.  Follow-up should include a check of the patient's device at a time
    remote (1-6 weeks) after the scan to confirm appropriate function.

9.  If the implanted device manufacturer has indicated additional safety
    precautions appropriate for safe MRI performance, these must be
    included in the study protocol.

> The clinical study must adhere to the following standards of
> scientific integrity and relevance to the Medicare population:

a.  The principal purpose of the research study is to test whether a
    particular intervention potentially improves the participants'
    health outcomes.

b.  The research study is well supported by available scientific and
    medical information or it is intended to clarify or establish the
    health outcomes of interventions already in common clinical use.

c.  The research study does not unjustifiably duplicate existing
    studies.

d.  The research study design is appropriate to answer the research
    > question being asked in the study.

e.  The research study is sponsored by an organization or individual
    > capable of executing the proposed study successfully.

f.  The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal
    > regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found at
    > 45 CFR Part 46. If a study is regulated by the FDA, it must be in
    > compliance with 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56.

g.  All aspects of the research study are conducted according to
    > appropriate standards of scientific integrity (see
    > [[http://www.icmje.org]{.underline}](http://www.icmje.org/)).

h.  The research study has a written protocol that clearly addresses, or
    > incorporates by reference, the standards listed here as Medicare
    > requirements for CED coverage.

i.  The clinical research study is not designed to exclusively test
    > toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Trials
    > of all medical technologies measuring therapeutic outcomes as one
    > of the objectives meet this standard only if the disease or
    > condition being studied is life threatening as defined in 21 CFR
    > §312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment options.

j.  The clinical research study is registered on the
    > [[www.ClinicalTrials.gov]{.underline}](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/)
    > website by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the
    > enrollment of the first study subject.

k.  The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of
    > public release of all pre- specified outcomes to be measured,
    > including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is
    > terminated early. The results must be made public within 24 months
    > of the end of data collection. If a report is planned to be
    > published in a peer reviewed journal, then that initial release
    > may be an abstract that meets the requirements of the
    > International Committee of Medical Journal Editors
    > ([[http://www.icmje.org]{.underline}](http://www.icmje.org/)).
    > However, a full report of the outcomes must be made public no
    > later than three (3) years after the end of data collection.

l.  The research study protocol must explicitly discuss subpopulations
    > affected by the treatment under investigation, particularly
    > traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the
    > inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment of these
    > populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said
    > populations in the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria
    > are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or
    > retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must
    > discuss why these criteria are necessary.

m.  The research study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are
    > or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population
    > to infer whether Medicare patients may benefit from the
    > intervention. Separate discussions in the protocol may be
    > necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age,
    > disability, or Medicaid eligibility.

> Consistent with section 1142 of the Act, the Agency for Healthcare
> Research and Quality supports clinical research studies that CMS

> above-listed research questions.

-   MRI during a viable pregnancy is also contraindicated at this time.

-   The danger inherent in bringing ferromagnetic materials within range
    > of MRI units generally constrains the use of MRI on acutely ill
    > patients requiring life support systems and monitoring devices
    > that employ ferromagnetic materials.

-   In addition, the long imaging time and the enclosed position of the

-   The PET scan, whether at rest alone, or rest with stress, is
    performed in place of, but not in addition to, a single photon
    emission computed tomography (SPECT); or

-   The PET scan, whether at rest alone or rest with stress, is used

    is a test(s) whose results are equivocal, technically
    uninterpretable, or discordant with a patient\'s other clinical data
    and must be documented in the beneficiary\'s file.)

-   For any PET scan for which Medicare payment is claimed for dates of
    services prior to July 1, 2001, the claimant must submit additional
    specified information on the claim form (including proper codes
    and/or modifiers), to indicate the results of the PET scan. The
    claimant must also include information on whether the PET scan was
    performed after an inconclusive non-invasive cardiac test. The
    information submitted with respect to the previous noninvasive
    cardiac test must specify the type of test performed prior to the
    PET scan and whether it was inconclusive or unsatisfactory. These
    explanations are in the form of special G codes used for billing PET
    scans using Rb 82. Beginning July 1, 2001, claims should be
    submitted with the appropriate codes.

## Ammonia N-13 (Effective October 1, 2003)

> Effective for services performed on or after October 1, 2003, PET
> scans performed at rest or with pharmacological stress used for
> noninvasive imaging of the perfusion of the heart for the diagnosis
> and management of patients with known or suspected coronary artery
> disease using the FDA-approved radiopharmaceutical ammonia N-13 are
> covered, provided the requirements below are met:

-   The PET scan, whether at rest alone, or rest with stress, is
    performed in place of, but not in addition to, a SPECT; or

-   The PET scan, whether at rest alone or rest with stress, is used
    following a SPECT that was found to be inconclusive. In these cases,
    the PET scan must have been considered necessary in order to
    determine what medical or surgical intervention is required to treat
    the patient. (For purposes of this requirement, an inconclusive test
    is a test whose results are equivocal, technically uninterpretable,
    or discordant with a patient\'s other clinical data and must be
    documented in the beneficiary\'s file.)

# 220.6.13 - FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for Dementia and Neurodegenerative Diseases (Effective September 15, 2004)

## (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

A.  **General**

> Medicare covers FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans for
> either the differential diagnosis of fronto-temporal dementia (FTD)
> and Alzheimer's disease (AD) under specific requirements; OR, its use
> in a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)-approved practical
> clinical trial focused on the utility of FDG PET in the diagnosis or
> treatment of dementing neurodegenerative diseases. Specific
> requirements for each indication are clarified below:

B.  ## Nationally Covered Indications

    1.  **FDG PET Requirements for Coverage in the Differential
        Diagnosis of AD and FTD**

> An FDG PET scan is considered reasonable and necessary in patients
> with a recent diagnosis of dementia and documented cognitive decline
> of at least 6 months, who meet diagnostic criteria for both AD and
> FTD. These patients have been evaluated for specific alternate
> neurodegenerative diseases or other causative factors, but the cause
> of the clinical symptoms remains uncertain.
>
> The following additional conditions must be met before an FDG PET scan
> will be covered:

a.  The patient's onset, clinical presentation, or course of cognitive
    impairment is such that FTD is suspected as an alternative
    neurodegenerative cause of the cognitive decline. Specifically,
    symptoms such as social disinhibition, awkwardness, difficulties
    with language, or loss of executive function are more prominent
    early in the course of FTD than the memory loss typical of AD;

b.  The patient has had a comprehensive clinical evaluation (as defined
    by the American Academy of Neurology encompassing a medical history
    from the patient and a well-acquainted informant (including
    assessment of activities of daily living), physical and mental
    status examination (including formal documentation of cognitive
    decline occurring over at least 6 months) aided by cognitive scales
    or neuropsychological testing, laboratory tests, and structural
    imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed
    tomography (CT);

c.  The evaluation of the patient has been conducted by a physician
    experienced in the diagnosis and assessment of dementia;

d.  The evaluation of the patient did not clearly determine a specific
    neurodegenerative disease or other cause for the clinical symptoms,
    and information available through FDG PET is

> reasonably expected to help clarify the diagnosis between FTD and AD
> and help guide future treatment;

e.  The FDG PET scan is performed in a facility that has all the
    accreditation necessary to operate nuclear medicine equipment. The
    reading of the scan should be done by an expert in nuclear medicine,
    radiology, neurology, or psychiatry, with experience interpreting
    such scans in the presence of dementia;

f.  A brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or FDG
    PET scan has not been obtained for the same indication. (The
    indication can be considered to be different in patients who exhibit
    important changes in scope or severity of cognitive decline, and
    meet all other qualifying criteria listed above and below (including
    the judgment that the likely diagnosis remains uncertain.) The
    results of a prior SPECT or FDG PET scan must have been inconclusive
    or, in the case of SPECT, difficult to interpret due to immature or
    inadequate technology. In these instances, an FDG PET scan may be
    covered after 1 year has passed from the time the first SPECT or FDG
    PET scan was performed.)

g.  The referring and billing provider(s) have documented the
    appropriate evaluation of the Medicare beneficiary. Providers should
    establish the medical necessity of an FDG PET scan by ensuring that
    the following information has been collected and is maintained in
    the beneficiary medical record:

-   Date of onset of symptoms;

-   Diagnosis of clinical syndrome (normal aging; mild cognitive
    impairment (MCI); mild, moderate or severe dementia);

-   Mini mental status exam (MMSE) or similar test score;

-   Presumptive cause (possible, probable, uncertain AD);

-   Any neuropsychological testing performed;

-   Results of any structural imaging (MRI or CT) performed;

-   Relevant laboratory tests (B12, thyroid hormone); and,

-   Number and name of prescribed medications.

> The billing provider must furnish a copy of the FDG PET scan result
> for use by CMS and its MACs upon request. These verification
> requirements are consistent with Federal requirements set forth in 42
> Code of Federal Regulations, section 410.32 generally for diagnostic
> x-ray tests, diagnostic laboratory tests, and other tests. In summary,
> section 410.32 requires the billing physician and the referring
> physician to maintain information in the medical record of each
> patient to demonstrate medical necessity \[410.32(d) (2)\] and submit
> the information demonstrating medical necessity to CMS and/or its
> agents upon request \[410.32(d)(3)(I)\] (OMB number 0938-0685).

## FDG PET Requirements for Coverage in the Context of a CMS-approved Practical Clinical Trial Utilizing a Specific Protocol to Demonstrate the Utility of FDG PET in the Diagnosis, and Treatment of Neurodegenerative Dementing Diseases

> An FDG PET scan is considered reasonable and necessary in patients
> with MCI or early dementia (in clinical circumstances other than those
> specified in subparagraph 1) only in the context of an approved
> clinical trial that contains patient safeguards and protections to
> ensure proper administration, use and evaluation of the FDG PET scan.
>
> The clinical trial must compare patients who do and do not receive an
> FDG PET scan and have as its goal to monitor, evaluate, and improve
> clinical outcomes. In addition, it must meet the following basic
> criteria:

a.  Written protocol on file;

b.  Institutional Review Board review and approval;

c.  Scientific review and approval by two or more qualified individuals
    who are not part of the research team; and,

d.  Certification that investigators have not been disqualified.

## Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> All other uses of FDG PET for patients with a presumptive diagnosis of
> dementia-causing neurodegenerative disease (e.g., possible or probable
> AD, clinically typical FTD, dementia of Lewy bodies, or
> Creutzfeld-Jacob disease) for which CMS has not specifically indicated
> coverage continue to be non-covered.

## Other

> Not applicable.

# 220.6.17 - Positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET) for Oncologic Conditions (Effective June 11, 2013)

## (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> **A.** General
>
> FDG (2-\[F18\] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose) Positron Emission Tomography
> (PET) is a minimally-invasive diagnostic imaging procedure used to
> evaluate glucose metabolism in normal tissue as well as in diseased
> tissues in conditions such as cancer, ischemic heart disease, and some
> neurologic disorders. FDG is an injected radionuclide (or
> radiopharmaceutical) that emits sub-atomic particles, known as
> positrons, as it decays. FDG PET uses a positron camera (tomograph) to
> measure the decay of FDG. The rate of FDG decay provides biochemical
> information on glucose metabolism in the tissue being studied. As
> malignancies can cause abnormalities of metabolism and blood flow, FDG
> PET evaluation may indicate the probable presence or absence of a
> malignancy based upon observed differences in biologic activity
> compared to adjacent tissues.
>
> The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) was asked by the
> National Oncologic PET Registry (NOPR) to reconsider section 220.6 of
> the National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Manual to end the
> prospective data collection requirements under Coverage with Evidence
> Development (CED) across all oncologic indications of FDG PET imaging.
> The CMS received public input indicating that the current coverage
> framework of prospective data collection under CED be ended for all
> oncologic uses of FDG PET imaging.

1.  Framework

> Effective for claims with dates of service on and after June 11, 2013,
> CMS is adopting a coverage framework that ends the prospective data
> collection requirements by NOPR under CED for all oncologic uses of
> FDG PET imaging. CMS is making this change for all NCDs that address
> coverage of FDG PET for oncologic uses addressed in this decision.
> This decision does not change coverage for any use of PET imaging
> using radiopharmaceuticals NaF-18 (fluorine- 18 labeled sodium
> fluoride), ammonia N-13, or rubidium-82 (Rb-82).

2.  Initial Anti-Tumor Treatment Strategy

> CMS continues to believe that the evidence is adequate to determine
> that the results of FDG PET imaging are useful in determining the
> appropriate initial anti-tumor treatment strategy for beneficiaries
> with suspected cancer and improve health outcomes and thus are
> reasonable and necessary under §1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security
> Act (the Act).
>
> Therefore, CMS continues to nationally cover one FDG PET study for
> beneficiaries who have
>
> cancers that are biopsy proven or strongly suspected based on other
> diagnostic testing when the beneficiary's treating physician
> determines that the FDG PET study is needed to determine the location
> and/or extent of the tumor for the following therapeutic purposes
> related to the initial anti-tumor treatment strategy:

-   To determine whether or not the beneficiary is an appropriate
    candidate for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure; or

-   To determine the optimal anatomic location for an invasive
    procedure; or

-   To determine the anatomic extent of tumor when the recommended
    anti-tumor treatment reasonably depends on the extent of the tumor.

> See the table at the end of this section for a synopsis of all
> nationally covered and non-covered oncologic uses of FDG PET imaging.

1.  Initial Anti-Tumor Treatment Strategy Nationally Covered Indications

    a.  CMS continues to nationally cover FDG PET imaging for the
        initial anti-tumor treatment strategy for male and female breast
        cancer only when used in staging distant metastasis.

    b.  CMS continues to nationally cover FDG PET to determine initial
        > anti-tumor treatment strategy for melanoma other than for the
        > evaluation of regional lymph nodes.

    c.  CMS continues to nationally cover FDG PET imaging for the
        > detection of pre-treatment metastasis (i.e., staging) in newly
        > diagnosed cervical cancers.

# 220.6.20 - Beta Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography in Dementia and Neurodegenerative Disease

## (Rev. 164, Issued: 03-27-14, Effective: 09-27-13, Implementation: 07-07-14)

A.  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has determined
    that the evidence is insufficient to conclude that the use of
    positron emission tomography (PET) beta amyloid (also referred to as
    amyloid-beta (Aβ)) imaging is reasonable and necessary for the
    diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the
    functioning of a malformed body member for Medicare beneficiaries
    with dementia or neurodegenerative disease, and thus PET Aβ imaging
    is not covered under §1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act ("the
    Act").

B.  However, there is sufficient evidence that the use of PET Aβ imaging
    is promising in two

> scenarios: (1) to exclude Alzheimer's disease (AD) in narrowly defined
> and clinically difficult
>
> differential diagnoses, such as AD versus frontotemporal dementia
> (FTD); and (2) to enrich clinical trials seeking better treatments or
> prevention strategies for AD, by allowing for selection of patients on
> the basis of biological as well as clinical and epidemiological
> factors.
>
> Therefore, we will cover one PET Aβ scan per patient through coverage
> with evidence development (CED), under §1862(a)(1)(E) of the Act, in
> clinical studies that meet the criteria in each of the paragraphs
> below.
>
> Clinical study objectives must be to (1) develop better treatments or
> prevention strategies for AD, or, as a strategy to identify
> subpopulations at risk for developing AD, or (2) resolve clinically
> difficult differential diagnoses (e.g., frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
> versus AD) where the use of PET Aβ imaging appears to improve health
> outcomes. These may include short term outcomes related to changes in
> management as well as longer term dementia outcomes.
>
> Clinical studies must be approved by CMS, involve subjects from
> appropriate populations, and be comparative and longitudinal. Where
> appropriate, studies should be prospective, randomized, and use
> postmortem diagnosis as the endpoint. Radiopharmaceuticals used in the
> PET Aβ scans must be FDA approved. Approved studies must address one
> or more aspects of the following questions. For Medicare beneficiaries
> with cognitive impairment suspicious for AD, or who may be at risk for
> developing AD:

1.  Do the results of PET Aβ imaging lead to improved health outcomes?
    > Meaningful health outcomes of interest include: avoidance of
    > futile treatment or tests; improving, or slowing the decline of,
    > quality of life; and survival.

2.  Are there specific subpopulations, patient characteristics or
    > differential diagnoses that are predictive of improved health
    > outcomes in patients whose management is guided by the PET Aβ
    > imaging?

3.  Does using PET Aβ imaging in guiding patient management, to enrich
    > clinical trials seeking better treatments or prevention strategies
    > for AD, by selecting patients on the basis of biological as well
    > as clinical and epidemiological factors, lead to improved health
    > outcomes?

> Any clinical study undertaken pursuant to this national coverage
> determination (NCD) must adhere to the timeframe designated in the
> approved clinical study protocol. Any approved clinical study must
> also adhere to the following standards of scientific integrity and
> relevance to the Medicare population.

a.  The principal purpose of the research study is to test whether a
    > particular intervention potentially improves the participants'
    > health outcomes.

b.  The research study is well supported by available scientific and
    > medical information or it is intended to clarify or establish the
    > health outcomes of interventions already in common clinical use.

c.  The research study does not unjustifiably duplicate existing
    > studies.

d.  The research study design is appropriate to answer the research
    > question being asked in the study.

e.  The research study is sponsored by an organization or individual
    > capable of executing the proposed study successfully.

f.  The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal
    > regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found at
    > 45 CFR Part 46. If a study is regulated by the Food and Drug
    > Administration (FDA), it must be in compliance with 21 CFR parts

g.  All aspects of the research study are conducted according to
    > appropriate standards of scientific integrity (see
    > [http://www.icmje.org](http://www.icmje.org/)).

h.  The research study has a written protocol that clearly addresses, or
    > incorporates by reference, the standards listed here as Medicare
    > requirements.

i.  The clinical research study is not designed to exclusively test
    > toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Trials
    > of all medical technologies measuring therapeutic outcomes as one
    > of the objectives meet this standard only if the disease or
    > condition being studied is life threatening as defined in 21 CFR
    > §312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment options.

j.  The clinical research study is registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov
    > website by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the
    > enrollment of the first study subject.

k.  The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of
    > public release of all pre- specified outcomes to be measured
    > including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or the
    > study is terminated early. The results must be made public within
    > 24 months of the end of data collection. If a report is planned to
    > be published in a peer reviewed journal, then that initial release
    > may be an abstract that meets the requirements of the
    > International Committee of Medical Journal Editors
    > (http://www.icmje.org). However a full report of the outcomes must
    > be made public no later than three (3) years after the end of data
    > collection.

l.  The research study protocol must explicitly discuss subpopulations
    > affected by the treatment under investigation, particularly
    > traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the
    > inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment of these
    > populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said
    > populations on the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria
    > are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or
    > retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must
    > discuss why these criteria are necessary.

m.  The research study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are
    > or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population
    > to infer whether Medicare patients may benefit from the
    > intervention. Separate discussions in the protocol may be
    > necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age,
    > disability or Medicaid eligibility.

> Consistent with §1142 of the Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research
> and Quality (AHRQ) supports clinical research studies that CMS

# - Water Purification and Softening Systems Used in Conjunction With Home Dialysis

## (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

A.  **Water Purification Systems**

> Water used for home dialysis should be chemically free of heavy trace
> metals and/or organic contaminants that could be hazardous to the
> patient. It should also be as free of bacteria as possible but need
> not be biologically sterile. Since the characteristics of natural
> water supplies in most areas of the country are such that some type of
> water purification system is needed, such a system used in conjunction
> with a home dialysis (either peritoneal or hemodialysis) unit is
> covered under Medicare.
>
> There are two types of water purification systems that will satisfy
> these requirements:

-   Deionization - The removal of organic substances, mineral salts of
    > magnesium and calcium (causing hardness), compounds of fluoride
    > and chloride from tap water using the process of filtration and
    > ion exchange; or

-   Reverse Osmosis (RO) - The process used to remove impurities from
    > tap water utilizing pressure to force water through a porous
    > membrane.

> Use of both a deionization unit and RO unit in series, theoretically
> to provide the advantages of both systems, has been determined
> medically unnecessary since either system can provide water which is
> both chemically and bacteriologically pure enough for acceptable use
> in home dialysis. In addition, spare deionization tanks are not
> covered since they are essentially a precautionary supply rather than
> a current requirement for treatment of the patient.
>
> Activated carbon filters used as a component of water purification
> systems to remove unsafe concentrations of chlorine and chloramines
> are covered when prescribed by a physician.

## Water Softening System

> Except as indicated below, a water softening system used in
> conjunction with home dialysis is excluded from coverage under
> Medicare as not being reasonable and necessary within the meaning of
> [[§1862(a)(1)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Social Security Act. Such a system, in conjunction with a home
> dialysis unit, does not adequately remove the hazardous heavy metal
> contaminants (such as arsenic) which may be present in trace amounts.
>
> A water softening system may be covered when used to pretreat water to
> be purified by a RO unit for home dialysis where:
>
> The manufacturer of the RO unit has set standards for the quality of
> water entering the RO (e.g., the water to be purified by the RO must
> be of a certain quality if the unit is to perform as intended);
>
> The patient's water is demonstrated to be of a lesser quality than
> required; and,
>
> The softener is used only to soften water entering the RO unit, and
> thus, used only for dialysis. (The softener need not actually be built
> into the RO unit, but must be an integral part of the dialysis
> system.)

## Developing Need When a Water Softening System is Replaced with a Water Purification Unit in an Existing Home Dialysis System

> The medical necessity of water purification units must be carefully
> developed when they replace water softening systems in existing home
> dialysis systems. A purification system may be ordered under these
> circumstances for a number of reasons. For example, changes in the
> medical community's opinions regarding the quality of water necessary
> for safe dialysis may lead the physician to decide the quality of
> water previously used should be improved, or the water quality itself
> may have deteriorated. Patients may have dialyzed using only an
> existing water softener previous to Medicare end-stage renal disease
> coverage because of inability to pay for a purification system. On the
> other hand, in some cases, the installation of a purification system
> is not medically necessary. Thus, when such a case comes to the A/B
> MAC (A)'s attention, the MAC asks the physician to furnish the reason
> for the changes. Supporting documentation, such as the suppliers'
> recommendations or water analysis, may be required. All such cases
> should be reviewed by the MAC's medical consultants.

>
> Not Covered
>
> An electrical continence aid is a device consisting of a plastic plug,
> molded into the shape of the patient's anal canal which contains two

>
> **CIM 65-11**
>
> Not Covered
>
> There are a number of devices available to induce emptying of the
> urinary bladder by using electrical current which forces the muscles
> of the bladder to contract. These devices (commonly known as bladder
> stimulators or pacemakers) are characterized by the implantation of
> electrodes in the wall of the bladder, the rectal cones, or the spinal
> cord. While these treatments may effectively empty the bladder, the
> issue of safety involving the initiation of infection, erosion,
> placement, and material selection has not been resolved. Further, some
> facilities previously using electronic emptying have stopped using
> this method due to the pain experienced by the patient.
>
> The use of spinal cord electrical stimulators, rectal electrical

# - Urinary Drainage Bags

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 65-17**
>
> Urinary collection and retention systems are covered as prosthetic
> devices that replace bladder function in the case of permanent urinary
> incontinence. Urinary drainage bags that can be used either as bedside
> or leg drainage bags may be either multi-use or single use systems.
> Both the multi-use and the single use bags have a system that prevents
> urine backflow. However, the single use system is non-drainable. There
> is insufficient evidence to support the medical necessity of a single
> use system bag rather than the multi-use bag. Therefore, a single use
> drainage system is subject to the same coverage parameters as the

# - Sacral Nerve Stimulation for Urinary Incontinence

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 65-18**
>
> Effective January 1, 2002, sacral nerve stimulation is covered for the
> treatment of urinary urge incontinence, urgency-frequency syndrome,
> and urinary retention. Sacral nerve stimulation involves both a
> temporary test stimulation to determine if an implantable stimulator
> would be effective and a permanent implantation in appropriate
> candidates. Both the test and the permanent implantation are covered.
>
> The following limitations for coverage apply to all three indications:

-   Patient must be refractory to conventional therapy (documented
    behavioral, pharmacologic and/or surgical corrective therapy) and be
    an appropriate surgical candidate such that implantation with
    anesthesia can occur.

-   Patients with stress incontinence, urinary obstruction, and specific
    neurologic diseases (e.g., diabetes with peripheral nerve
    involvement) which are associated with secondary manifestations of
    the above three indications are excluded.

-   Patient must have had a successful test stimulation in order to
    support subsequent implantation. Before a patient is eligible for
    permanent implantation, he/she must demonstrate a 50 percent or
    greater improvement through test stimulation. Improvement is
    measured through voiding diaries.

-   Patient must be able to demonstrate adequate ability to record
    voiding diary data such that clinical results of the implant
    procedure can be properly evaluated.

>
> **CIM 45-32**
>
> Carnitine is a naturally occurring substance that functions in the
> transport of the long-chain fatty acids for energy production by the

> professionally accepted method as recognized in current literature),
> along with signs and symptoms of:

-   Erythropoietin-resistant anemia (persistent hematocrit \< 30 percent
    with treatment) that has not responded to standard erthropoietin
    dosage (that which is considered clinically appropriate to treat the
    particular patient) with iron replacement, and for which other
    causes have been investigated and adequately treated, or

-   Hypotension on hemodialysis that interferes with delivery of the
    intended dialysis despite application of usual measures deemed
    appropriate (e.g., fluid management). Such episodes of hypotension
    must have occurred during at least 2 dialysis treatments in a 30-day
    period.

> Continued use of levocarnitine will not be covered if improvement has
> not been demonstrated within 6 months of initiation of treatment. All

>
> For a patient currently receiving intravenous levocarnitine, Medicare
> will cover continued treatment if:

-   Levocarnitine has been administered to treat
    erythropoietin-resistant anemia (persistent hematocrit \< 30 percent
    with treatment) that has not responded to standard erythropoietin
    dosage (that which is considered clinically appropriate to treat the
    particular patient) with iron replacement, and for which other
    causes have been investigated and adequately treated, or hypotension
    on hemodialysis that interferes with delivery of the intended
    dialysis despite application of usual measures deemed appropriate
    (e.g., fluid management) and such episodes of hypotension occur
    during at least 2 dialysis treatments in a 30-day period; and

-   The patient's medical record documents a pre-dialysis plasma free
    carnitine level \< 40 micromol/L prior to the initiation of
    treatment; or

> The treating physician certifies (documents in the medical record)
> that in his/her judgment, if treatment with the levocarnitine is
> discontinued, the patient's pre-dialysis carnitine level would fall
> below 40 micromol/L and the patient would have recurrent

2.  **In addition, the patient must have:**

    -   Severe upper lobe predominant emphysema (as defined by
        radiologist assessment of upper lobe predominance on CT scan),
        or

    -   Severe non-upper lobe emphysema with low exercise capacity.

> Patients with low exercise capacity are those whose maximal exercise
> capacity is at or below 25 watts for women and 40 watts (w) for men
> after completion of the preoperative therapeutic program in

C.  ## Nationally Non-covered Indications

    1.  **LVRS is not covered in any of the following clinical
        circumstances:**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  Patient characteristics carry a high risk for perioperative
    > morbidity and/or mortality;

b.  The disease is unsuitable for LVRS;

c.  Medical conditions or other circumstances make it likely that the
    patient will be unable to complete the preoperative and
    postoperative pulmonary diagnostic and therapeutic program required
    for surgery;

d.  The patient presents with FEV1 [\<]{.underline}20% of predicted
    value, and either homogeneous distribution of emphysema on CT scan,
    or carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of [\<]{.underline}20% of
    predicted value (high-risk group identified October 2001 by the
    NETT); or

e.  The patient satisfies the criteria outlined above in section B(1),
    and has severe, non- upper lobe emphysema with high exercise
    capacity. High exercise capacity is defined as a maximal workload at
    the completion of the preoperative diagnostic and therapeutic
    program that is above 25 w for women and 40 w for men (under the
    measurement conditions for cycle ergometry specified above).

    1.  ## All other indications for LVRS not otherwise specified remain noncovered.

## (Rev.11587; Issued: 09-08-22; Effective: 09-27-21; Implementation: 01-03-23)

A.  **General**

> When used in the home, oxygen and oxygen equipment can make meaningful
> contributions to the treatment of patients with both acute and chronic
> conditions who require the medical gas on either a short- or long-term
> basis.

B.  **Nationally Covered Indications**

> Oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment is covered in the home for acute
> or chronic conditions, short- or long- term, when the patient exhibits
> hypoxemia as defined below.
>
> Initial claims for oxygen therapy for hypoxemic patients must be based
> on the results of a clinical test that has been ordered and evaluated
> by the treating practitioner. Such a test is usually in the form of a
> measurement of the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in arterial blood.
> A measurement of arterial oxygen saturation obtained by ear or pulse
> oximetry, however, is also acceptable when ordered and evaluated by
> the treating practitioner and performed under his or her supervision
> or when performed by a qualified provider or supplier of laboratory
> services. A durable medical equipment (DME) supplier is not considered
> a qualified provider or supplier of laboratory services for purposes
> of this National Coverage Determination (NCD). This prohibition does
> not extend to the results of blood gas tests conducted by a hospital
> certified to do such tests.
>
> When the arterial blood gas and the oximetry studies are both used to
> document the need for home oxygen therapy and the results are
> conflicting, the arterial blood gas study is the preferred source of
> documenting medical need.
>
> Required qualifying arterial blood gas or oximetry studies must be
> performed at the time of need. The time of need is defined as during
> the patient's illness when the presumption is that the provision of
> oxygen in the home setting will improve the patient's condition. For
> an inpatient hospital patient the time of need is within 2 days of
> discharge. For those patients whose initial oxygen prescription does
> not originate during an inpatient hospital stay, the time of need is
> during the period when the treating practitioner notes signs and
> symptoms of illness that can be relieved by oxygen in the patient who
> is to be treated at home.
>
> Patients exhibiting hypoxemia are defined using the clinical criteria
> below: Group I:

-   An arterial PO2 at or below 55 mm Hg, or an arterial oxygen
    > saturation at or below 88%,

> taken at rest, breathing room air; or

-   An arterial PO2 at or below 55 mm Hg, or an arterial oxygen
    > saturation at or below 88%, taken during sleep for a patient who
    > demonstrates an arterial PO2 at or above 56 mm Hg, or an arterial
    > oxygen saturation at or above 89%, while awake; or a greater than
    > normal fall in oxygen level during sleep (a decrease in arterial
    > PO2 more than 10 mm Hg, or decrease in arterial oxygen saturation
    > more than 5%) associated with symptoms or signs reasonably

A.  **General**

> Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is a non-invasive technique
> for providing single levels of air pressure from a flow generator, via
> a nose mask, through the nares. The purpose is to prevent the collapse
> of the oropharyngeal walls and the obstruction of airflow during

>
> The apnea hypopnea index (AHI) is equal to the average number of
> episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour. The respiratory disturbance
> index (RDI) is equal to the average number of respiratory disturbances
> per hour.
>
> Apnea is defined as a cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds.
> Hypopnea is defined as an abnormal respiratory event lasting at least
> 10 seconds with at least a 30% reduction in thoracoabdominal movement
> or airflow as compared to baseline, and with at least a 4% oxygen
> desaturation.
>
> The AHI and/or RDI may be measured by polysomnography (PSG) in a

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective for claims with dates of service on and after March 13,
> 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) determines
> that CPAP therapy when used in adult patients with OSA is considered
> reasonable and necessary under the following situations:

1.  The use of CPAP is covered under Medicare when used in adult
    patients with OSA. Coverage of CPAP is initially limited to a
    12-week period to identify beneficiaries diagnosed with OSA as
    subsequently described who benefit from CPAP. CPAP is subsequently
    covered only for those beneficiaries diagnosed with OSA who benefit
    from CPAP during this 12-week period.

2.  The provider of CPAP must conduct education of the beneficiary prior
    to the use of the CPAP device to ensure that the beneficiary has
    been educated in the proper use of the device. A caregiver, for
    example a family member, may be compensatory, if consistently
    available in the beneficiary\'s home and willing and able to safely
    operate the CPAP device.

3.  A positive diagnosis of OSA for the coverage of CPAP must include a
    clinical evaluation and a positive:

    a.  attended PSG performed in a sleep laboratory; or

    b.  unattended HST with a Type II home sleep monitoring device; or

    c.  unattended HST with a Type III home sleep monitoring device; or

    d.  unattended HST with a Type IV home sleep monitoring device that
        measures at least 3 channels.

4.  The sleep test must have been previously ordered by the
    beneficiary's treating physician and furnished under appropriate
    physician supervision.

5.  An initial 12-week period of CPAP is covered in adult patients with
    OSA if either of the following criterion using the AHI or RDI are
    met:

    a.  AHI or RDI greater than or equal to 15 events per hour, or

    b.  AHI or RDI greater than or equal to 5 events and less than or
        equal to 14 events per hour with documented symptoms of
        excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired cognition, mood disorders
        or insomnia, or documented hypertension, ischemic heart disease,
        or history of stroke.

6.  The AHI or RDI is calculated on the average number of events of per
    hour. If the AHI or RDI is calculated based on less than 2 hours of
    continuous recorded sleep, the total number of recorded events to
    calculate the AHI or RDI during sleep testing must be at a minimum
    the number of events that would have been required in a 2-hour
    period.

7.  Apnea is defined as a cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds.
    Hypopnea is defined as an abnormal respiratory event lasting at
    least 10 seconds with at least a 30% reduction in thoracoabdominal
    movement or airflow as compared to baseline, and with at least a 4%
    oxygen desaturation.

8.  Coverage with Evidence Development (CED): Medicare provides the
    following limited coverage for CPAP in adult beneficiaries who do
    not qualify for CPAP coverage based on criteria 1-7 above. A
    clinical study seeking Medicare payment for CPAP provided to a
    beneficiary who is an enrolled subject in that study must address
    one or more of the following questions:

    a.  In Medicare-aged subjects with clinically identified risk
        > factors for OSA, how does the diagnostic accuracy of a
        > clinical trial of CPAP compare with PSG and Type II, III & IV
        > HST in identifying subjects with OSA who will respond to CPAP?

    b.  In Medicare-aged subjects with clinically identified risk
        > factors for OSA who have not undergone confirmatory testing
        > with PSG or Type II, III & IV HST, does CPAP cause clinically
        > meaningful harm?

    c.  The study must meet the following additional standards:

    d.  The principal purpose of the research study is to test whether a
        > particular intervention potentially improves the participants'
        > health outcomes.

    e.  The research study is well-supported by available scientific and
        > medical information or it is intended to clarify or establish
        > the health outcomes of interventions already in common
        > clinical use.

    f.  The research study does not unjustifiably duplicate existing
        > studies.

    g.  The research study design is appropriate to answer the research
        > question being asked in the study.

    h.  The research study is sponsored by an organization or individual
        > capable of executing the proposed study successfully.

    i.  The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal
        > regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found
        > at 45 CFR Part 46. If a study is Food and Drug
        > Administration-regulated, it also must be in compliance with
        > 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56.

    j.  All aspects of the research study are conducted according to the
        > appropriate standards of scientific integrity.

    k.  The research study has a written protocol that clearly
        > addresses, or incorporates by reference, the Medicare
        > standards.

    l.  The clinical research study is not designed to exclusively test
        > toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals.
        > Trials of all medical technologies measuring therapeutic
        > outcomes as one of the objectives meet this standard only if
        > the disease or condition being studied is life-threatening as
        > defined in 21 CFR §312.81(a) and the patient has no other
        > viable treatment options.

    m.  The clinical research study is registered on the
        > ClinicalTrials.gov Web site by the principal
        > sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the first
        > study subject.

    n.  The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of
        > public release of all pre- specified outcomes to be measured,
        > including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or
        > study is terminated early. The results must be made public

        > of the

> International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. However, a full
> report of the outcomes must be made public no later than 3 years after
> the end of data collection.

o.  The research study protocol must explicitly discuss subpopulations
    > affected by the treatment under investigation, particularly
    > traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the
    > inclusion and exclusion criteria affect enrollment of these
    > populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said
    > populations in the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria
    > are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or
    > retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must
    > discuss why these criteria are necessary.

p.  The research study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are
    > or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population
    > to infer whether Medicare patients may benefit from the
    > intervention. Separate discussions in the protocol may be

> the sleep laboratory over 2
>
> nights for the diagnosis of OSA and the initiation of continuous
> positive airway pressure (CPAP).
>
> Three categories of portable monitors (used both in attended and
> unattended settings) have been developed for the diagnosis of OSA.
> Type II monitors have a minimum of 7 channels (e.g., EEG, EOG, EMG,
> ECG-heart rate, airflow, breathing/respiratory effort, SaO2)-this type
> of device monitors sleep staging, so AHI can be calculated). Type III
> monitors have a minimum of 4 monitored channels including ventilation
> or airflow (at least two channels of respiratory movement or
> respiratory movement and airflow), heart rate or ECG, and oxygen
> saturation.
>
> Type IV devices may measure one, two, three or more parameters but do
> not meet all the criteria of a higher category device. Some monitors
> use an actigraphy algorithm to identify periods of sleep and
> wakefulness.

1.  Type I PSG is covered when used to aid the diagnosis of OSA in
    beneficiaries who have clinical signs and symptoms indicative of OSA
    if performed attended in a sleep lab facility.

2.  Type II or Type III sleep testing devices are covered when used to
    aid the diagnosis of OSA in beneficiaries who have clinical signs
    and symptoms indicative of OSA if performed unattended in or out of
    a sleep lab facility or attended in a sleep lab facility.

3.  Type IV sleep testing devices measuring three or more channels, one
    of which is airflow, are covered when used to aid the diagnosis of
    OSA in beneficiaries who have signs and symptoms indicative of OSA
    if performed unattended in or out of a sleep lab facility or
    attended in a sleep lab facility.

4.  Sleep testing devices measuring three or more channels that include
    actigraphy, oximetry, and peripheral arterial tone, are covered when
    used to aid the diagnosis of OSA in beneficiaries who have signs and

3.  Patients must have a history of medically-uncontrollable labile
    (brittle) insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus with documented
    recurrent, severe, acutely life-threatening metabolic complications
    that require hospitalization. Aforementioned complications include
    frequent hypoglycemia unawareness or recurring severe ketoacidosis,
    or recurring severe hypoglycemic attacks;

4.  Patients must have been optimally and intensively managed by an
    endocrinologist for at least 12 months with the most
    medically-recognized advanced insulin formulations and delivery
    systems;

5.  Patients must have the emotional and mental capacity to understand
    the significant risks associated with surgery and to effectively

## General

> Medicare covers intestinal and multi-visceral transplantation for the
> purpose of restoring intestinal function in patients with irreversible
> intestinal failure. Intestinal failure is defined as the loss of
> absorptive capacity of the small bowel secondary to severe primary
> gastrointestinal disease or surgically induced short bowel syndrome.
> It may be associated with both mortality and profound morbidity.
> Multi-visceral transplantation includes organs in the digestive system
> (stomach, duodenum, pancreas, liver and intestine).
>
> The evidence supports the fact that aged patients generally do not
> survive as well as younger patients receiving intestinal
> transplantation. Nonetheless, some older patients who are free from
> other contraindications have received the procedure and are
> progressing well, as evidenced by the United Network for Organ Sharing
> (UNOS) data. Thus, it is not appropriate to include specific
> exclusions from coverage, such as an age limitation, in the national
> coverage policy.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective for services performed on or after April 1, 2001, this
> procedure is covered only when performed for patients who have failed
> total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and only when performed in centers
> that meet approval criteria.

1.  Failed TPN

> The TPN delivers nutrients intravenously, avoiding the need for
> absorption through the small bowel. TPN failure includes the
> following:

-   Impending or overt liver failure due to TPN induced liver injury.
    The clinical manifestations include elevated serum bilirubin and/or
    liver enzymes, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, gastroesophageal
    varices, coagulopathy, stomal bleeding or hepatic
    fibrosis/cirrhosis.

-   Thrombosis of the major central venous channels; jugular,
    subclavian, and femoral veins. Thrombosis of two or more of these
    vessels is considered a life threatening complication and failure of
    TPN therapy. The sequelae of central venous thrombosis are lack of
    access for TPN infusion, fatal sepsis due to infected thrombi,
    pulmonary embolism, Superior Vena Cava syndrome, or chronic venous
    insufficiency.

-   Frequent line infection and sepsis. The development of two or more
    episodes of systemic sepsis secondary to line infection per year
    that requires hospitalization indicates failure of TPN therapy. A
    single episode of line related fungemia, septic shock and/or Acute
    Respiratory Distress Syndrome are considered indicators of TPN
    failure.

-   Frequent episodes of severe dehydration despite intravenous fluid
    supplement in addition to TPN. Under certain medical conditions such
    as secretory diarrhea and non- constructable gastrointestinal tract,
    the loss of the gastrointestinal and pancreatobiliary secretions
    exceeds the maximum intravenous infusion rates that can be tolerated
    by the cardiopulmonary system. Frequent episodes of dehydration are
    deleterious to all body organs particularly kidneys

> and the central nervous system with the development of multiple kidney
> stones, renal failure, and permanent brain damage.

2.  Approved Transplant Facilities

> Intestinal transplantation is covered by Medicare if performed in an
> approved facility. The criteria for approval of centers will be based
> on a volume of 10 intestinal transplants per year with a 1-year
> actuarial survival of 65 percent using the Kaplan-Meier technique.

-   The hospitals share resources by routinely using the same personnel
    or services in their transplant programs. The sharing of resources
    must be supported by the submission of operative notes or other
    information that documents the routine use of the same personnel and
    services in all of the individual hospitals. At a minimum, shared
    resources means:

-   The individual members of the transplant team, consisting of the

## (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> Electrical stimulation (ES) and electromagnetic therapy have been used
> or studied for many different applications, one of which is
> accelerating wound healing. ES for the treatment of wounds is the
> application of electrical current through electrodes placed directly
> on the skin in close proximity to the wound. Electromagnetic therapy
> uses a pulsed magnetic field to induce current. The Centers for
> Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) was asked to reconsider its
> national non-coverage determination for electromagnetic therapy. After
> thorough review, CMS determined that the results from the use of
> electromagnetic therapy for the treatment of wounds were similar to
> the results from the use of ES. Therefore, effective July 1, 2004,
> Medicare will cover electromagnetic therapy for the same settings and
> conditions for which ES is covered.
>
> This means Medicare will allow either one covered ES therapy or one
> covered electromagnetic therapy for the treatment of wounds.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> The use of ES and electromagnetic therapy for the treatment of wounds
> are considered adjunctive therapies, and will only be covered for
> chronic Stage III or Stage IV pressure ulcers, arterial ulcers,
> diabetic ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers. Chronic ulcers are defined
> as ulcers that have not healed within 30 days of occurrence. ES or
> electromagnetic therapy will be covered only after appropriate
> standard wound therapy has been tried for at least 30 days and there
> are no measurable signs of improved healing. This 30-day period may
> begin while the wound is acute.
>
> Standard wound care includes: optimization of nutritional status,
> debridement by any means to remove devitalized tissue, maintenance of
> a clean, moist bed of granulation tissue with appropriate moist
> dressings, and necessary treatment to resolve any infection that may
> be present. Standard wound care based on the specific type of wound
> includes: frequent repositioning of a patient with pressure ulcers
> (usually every 2 hours), off-loading of pressure and good glucose
> control for diabetic ulcers, establishment of adequate circulation for
> arterial ulcers, and the use of a compression system for patients with
> venous ulcers.
>
> Measurable signs of improved healing include: a decrease in wound size
> (either surface area or volume), decrease in amount of exudates, and
> decrease in amount of necrotic tissue. ES or electromagnetic therapy
> must be discontinued when the wound demonstrates 100% epithelialized
> wound bed.
>
> The ES and electromagnetic therapy services can only be covered when
> performed by a physician, physical therapist, or incident to a
> physician service. Evaluation of the wound is an integral part of
> wound therapy. When a physician, physical therapist, or a clinician
> incident to a physician, performs ES or electromagnetic therapy, the
> practitioner must evaluate the wound and contact the treating
> physician if the wound worsens. If ES or electromagnetic therapy is
> being used, wounds must be evaluated at least monthly by the treating
> physician.

B.  ## Nationally Non-Covered Indications

    1.  ES and electromagnetic therapy will not be covered as an initial

# - Blood-Derived Products for Chronic Non-Healing Wounds

## (Rev. 11214, Issued: 01-20-22, Effective:04-13-21, Implementation: 01-03-22 Shared Systems Contractors, 02-14-22 MACs)

A.  **General**

> Wound healing is a dynamic, interactive process that involves multiple
> cells and proteins. There are three progressive stages of normal wound
> healing, and the typical wound healing duration is about 4 weeks.
> While cutaneous wounds are a disruption of the normal, anatomic
> structure and function of the skin, subcutaneous wounds involve tissue
> below the skin\'s surface. Wounds are categorized as either acute,
> where the normal wound healing stages are not yet completed but it is
> presumed they will be, resulting in orderly and timely wound repair,
> or chronic, where a wound has failed to progress through the normal
> wound healing stages and repair itself within a sufficient time
> period.
>
> Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is produced in an autologous or homologous
> manner. Autologous PRP is comprised of blood from the patient who will
> ultimately receive the PRP. Alternatively, homologous PRP is derived
> from blood from multiple donors.
>
> Blood is donated by the patient and centrifuged to produce an
> autologous gel for treatment of chronic, non-healing cutaneous wounds
> that persist for 30 days or longer and fail to properly complete the
> healing process. Autologous blood derived products for chronic,
> non-healing wounds includes both: (1) platelet derived growth factor
> (PDGF) products, and (2) PRP (such as AutoloGel).
>
> The PRP is different from previous products in that it contains whole
> cells including white cells, red cells, plasma, platelets, fibrin,
> stem cells, and fibrocyte precursors.
>
> The PRP is used by physicians in clinical settings in treating
> chronic, non-healing wounds, open, cutaneous wounds, soft tissue and
> bone. Alternatively, PDGF does not contain cells and was previously
> marketed as a product to be used by patients at home.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective for services performed on or after April 13, 2021, the
> Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will cover autologous
> PRP for the treatment of chronic non-healing diabetic wounds under
> section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act) for a
> duration of 20 weeks, when prepared by devices whose Food and Drug
> Administration-cleared indications include the management of exuding
> cutaneous wounds, such as diabetic ulcers.

## Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> Autologous PDGF for the treatment of chronic, non-healing cutaneous
> wounds, and,
>
> Becaplermin, a non-autologous growth factor for chronic, non-healing
> subcutaneous wounds, and,
>
> Autologous PRP for the treatment of acute surgical wounds when the
> autologous PRP is applied directly to the closed incision, or for
> dehiscent wounds.

## Other

> Effective for services performed on or after April 13, 2021:
>
> Coverage of autologous PRP for the treatment of chronic non-healing
> diabetic wounds beyond 20 weeks will be determined by the local
> Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs).
>
> Coverage of autologous PRP for the treatment of all other chronic
> non-healing wounds will be determined by the local MACs under section
> 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act.

# - Treatment of Decubitus Ulcers

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-31**
>
> An accepted procedure for healing decubitus ulcers is to remove dead
> tissue from the lesions and to keep them clean to promote the growth
> of new tissue. This may be accomplished by hydrotherapy (whirlpool)
> treatments. Hydrotherapy (whirlpool) treatment for decubitus ulcers is
>
> a covered service under Medicare for patients when treatment is
> reasonable and necessary. Some other methods of treating decubitus
> ulcers, the safety and effectiveness of which have not been
> established, are not covered under the Medicare program. Some examples
> of these types of treatments are: ultraviolet light, low intensity
> direct current, topical application of oxygen, and topical dressings
> with Balsam of Peru in castor oil.

# - Porcine Skin and Gradient Pressure Dressings

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 45-12**
>
> Porcine (pig) skin dressings are covered, if reasonable and necessary
> for the individual patient as an occlusive dressing for burns, donor
> sites of a homograft, and decubiti and other ulcers.
>
> Gradient pressure dressings are Jobst elasticized heavy duty dressings
> used to reduce hypertrophic scarring and joint contractures following
> burn injury. They are covered when used for that purpose.

# - Infrared Therapy Devices (Effective October 24, 2006)

## (Rev. 62, Issued: 12-15-06, Effective: 10-24-06, Implementation: 01-16-07)

A.  **General**

> Infrared therapy devices are used to treat an area of the skin and
> adjacent subcutaneous tissues of a patient with infrared therapy
> energy, using an array of juxtaposed infrared diodes affixed to a
> flexible pad to retain skin contact. The devices can also produce
> local warming, though this may be a secondary effect. The use of
> infrared therapy devices has been proposed for a variety of disorders;
> including treatment of diabetic neuropathy, other peripheral
> neuropathy, skin ulcers and wounds, and similar related conditions,
> including conditions such as pain arising form these conditions. A
> wide variety of devices are currently available.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> N/A

## Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> Effective for services performed on and after October 24, 2006, the
> Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has determined that there is
> sufficient evidence to conclude the use of infrared therapy devices
> and any related accessories is not reasonable and necessary under
> section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act). The use of
> infrared and/or near-infrared light and/or heat, including
> monochromatic infrared energy, is non-covered for the treatment,
> including the symptoms such as pain arising form these conditions, of
> diabetic and/or non- diabetic peripheral sensory neuropathy, wounds
> and/or ulcers of the skin and/or subcutaneous tissues.

    Medical Equipment Reference List (Effective May 5, 2005) (Rev. 173,
    Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10,
    Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)**

> The durable medical equipment (DME) list that follows is designed to
> facilitate the A/B MAC (HHH) and DME MACs processing of DME claims.
> This section is designed as a quick reference tool for determining the
> coverage status of certain pieces of DME and especially for those
> items commonly referred to by both brand and generic names. The
> information contained herein is applicable (where appropriate) to all
> DME national coverage determinations (NCDs) discussed in the DME
> portion of this manual. The list is organized into two columns. The
> first column lists alphabetically various generic categories of
> equipment on which NCDs have been made by the Centers for Medicare &
> Medicaid Services (CMS); the second column notes the coverage status.
>
> In the case of equipment categories that have been determined by CMS
> to be covered under the DME benefit, the list outlines the conditions
> of coverage that must be met if payment is to be allowed for the
> rental or purchase of the DME by a particular patient, or cross-refers
> to another section of the manual where the applicable coverage
> criteria are described in more detail. With respect to equipment
> categories that cannot be covered as DME, the list includes a brief
> explanation of why the equipment is not covered. This DME list will be
> updated periodically to reflect any additional NCDs that CMS may make
> with regard to other categories of equipment.
>
> When the A/B MAC (HHH) or DME MAC receives a claim for an item of
> equipment which does not appear to fall logically into any of the
> generic categories listed, the A/B MAC (HHH) or DME MAC has the
> authority and responsibility for deciding whether those items are
> covered under the DME benefit.
>
> These decisions must be made by each A/B MAC (HHH) and DME MAC based
> on the advice of its medical consultants, taking into account:

-   The Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 20, "Durable Medical
    Equipment, Prosthetics and Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS)."

-   Whether the item has been approved for marketing by the Food and
    Drug Administration (FDA) and is otherwise generally considered to
    be safe and effective for the purpose intended; and

-   Whether the item is reasonable and necessary for the individual
    patient.

> The term DME is defined as equipment which:

-   Can withstand repeated use; i.e., could normally be rented and used
    by successive patients;

-   Is primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose;

-   Generally is not useful to a person in the absence of illness or
    injury; and,

-   Is appropriate for use in a patient's home.

# - Mobility Assistive Equipment (MAE) (Effective May 5, 2005)

## (Rev. 37, Issued: 06-03-05; Effective: 05-05-05; Implementation: 07-05-05)

A.  **General**

> The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) addresses numerous
> items that it terms "mobility assistive equipment" (MAE) and includes
> within that category canes, crutches, walkers, manual wheelchairs,
> power wheelchairs, and scooters. This list, however, is not
> exhaustive.
>
> Medicare beneficiaries may require mobility assistance for a variety
> of reasons and for varying durations because the etiology of the
> disability may be due to a congenital cause, injury, or disease. Thus,
> some beneficiaries experiencing temporary disability may need mobility
> assistance on a short-term basis, while in contrast, those living with
> chronic conditions or enduring disabilities will require mobility
> assistance on a permanent basis.
>
> Medicare beneficiaries who depend upon mobility assistance are found
> in varied living situations. Some may live alone and independently
> while others may live with a caregiver or in a custodial care
> facility. The beneficiary's environment is relevant to the
> determination of the appropriate form of mobility assistance that
> should be employed. For many patients, a device of some sort is
> compensation for the mobility deficit. Many beneficiaries experience
> co-morbid conditions that can impact their ability to safely utilize
> MAE independently or to successfully regain independent function even
> with mobility assistance.
>
> The functional limitation as experienced by a beneficiary depends on
> the beneficiary's physical and psychological function, the
> availability of other support, and the beneficiary's living
> environment. A few examples include muscular spasticity, cognitive
> deficits, the availability of a caregiver, and the physical layout,
> surfaces, and obstacles that exist in the beneficiary's living
> environment.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective May 5, 2005, CMS finds that the evidence is adequate to
> determine that MAE is reasonable and necessary for beneficiaries who
> have a personal mobility deficit sufficient to impair their
> participation in mobility-related activities of daily living (MRADLs)
> such as toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, and bathing in
> customary locations within the home. Determination of the presence of
> a mobility deficit will be made by an algorithmic process, Clinical
> Criteria for MAE Coverage, to provide the appropriate MAE to correct
> the mobility deficit.
>
> Clinical Criteria for MAE Coverage
>
> The beneficiary, the beneficiary's family or other caregiver, or a
> clinician, will usually initiate the discussion and consideration of
> MAE use. Sequential consideration of the questions below provides
> clinical guidance for the coverage of equipment of appropriate type
> and complexity to restore the beneficiary's ability to participate in
> MRADLs such as toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, and bathing in
> customary locations in the home. These questions correspond to the
> numbered decision points on the accompanying flow chart. In individual
> cases where the beneficiary's condition clearly and unambiguously
> precludes the reasonable use of a device, it is not necessary to
> undertake a trial of that device for that beneficiary.

1.  Does the beneficiary have a mobility limitation that significantly
    impairs his/her ability to participate in one or more MRADLs in the
    home? A mobility limitation is one that:

    a.  Prevents the beneficiary from accomplishing the MRADLs entirely,
        > or,

    b.  Places the beneficiary at reasonably determined heightened risk
        of morbidity or mortality secondary to the attempts to
        participate in MRADLs, or,

    c.  Prevents the beneficiary from completing the MRADLs within a
        > reasonable time

> frame.

2.  Are there other conditions that limit the beneficiary's ability to
    participate in MRADLs at home?

    a.  Some examples are significant impairment of cognition or
        > judgment and/or vision.

    b.  For these beneficiaries, the provision of MAE might not enable
        them to participate in MRADLs if the comorbidity prevents
        effective use of the wheelchair or reasonable completion of the
        tasks even with MAE.

3.  If these other limitations exist, can they be ameliorated or
    compensated sufficiently such that the additional provision of MAE
    will be reasonably expected to significantly improve the
    beneficiary's ability to perform or obtain assistance to participate
    in MRADLs in the home?

    a.  A caregiver, for example a family member, may be compensatory,
        if consistently available in the beneficiary\'s home and willing
        and able to safely operate and transfer the beneficiary to and
        from the wheelchair and to transport the beneficiary using the
        wheelchair.

> The caregiver's need to use a wheelchair to assist the beneficiary in
> the MRADLs is to be considered in this determination.

b.  If the amelioration or compensation requires the beneficiary\'s
    compliance with treatment, for example medications or therapy,
    substantive non-compliance, whether willing or involuntary, can be
    grounds for denial of MAE coverage if it results in the beneficiary
    continuing to have a significant limitation. It may be determined
    that partial compliance results in adequate amelioration or
    compensation for the appropriate use of MAE.

```
4.  Does the beneficiary or caregiver demonstrate the capability and the
    willingness to consistently operate the MAE safely?

    a.  Safety considerations include personal risk to the beneficiary
        as well as risk to others. The determination of safety may need
        to occur several times during the process as the consideration
        focuses on a specific device.

    b.  A history of unsafe behavior in other venues may be considered.

5.  Can the functional mobility deficit be sufficiently resolved by the
    prescription of a cane or walker?

    a.  The cane or walker should be appropriately fitted to the
        beneficiary for this evaluation.

    b.  Assess the beneficiary's ability to safely use a cane or walker.

6.  Does the beneficiary's typical environment support the use of
    wheelchairs including scooters/power-operated vehicles (POVs)?

    a.  Determine whether the beneficiary's environment will support the
        use of these types of MAE.

    b.  Keep in mind such factors as physical layout, surfaces, and
        obstacles, which may render MAE unusable in the beneficiary's
        home.

7.  Does the beneficiary have sufficient upper extremity function to
    propel a manual wheelchair in the home to participate in MRADLs
    during a typical day? The manual wheelchair should be optimally
    configured (seating options, wheelbase, device weight, and other
    appropriate accessories) for this determination.

    a.  Limitations of strength, endurance, range of motion,
        coordination, and absence or deformity in one or both upper
        extremities are relevant.

    b.  A beneficiary with sufficient upper extremity function may
        qualify for a manual wheelchair. The appropriate type of manual
        wheelchair, i.e. light weight, etc., should be determined based
        on the beneficiary's physical characteristics and anticipated
        intensity of use.

    c.  The beneficiary\'s home should provide adequate access,
        maneuvering space and surfaces for the operation of a manual
        wheelchair.

    d.  Assess the beneficiary's ability to safely use a manual
        > wheelchair.

> **NOTE:** If the beneficiary is unable to self-propel a manual
> wheelchair, and if there is a caregiver who is available, willing, and
> able to provide assistance, a manual wheelchair may be appropriate.

8.  Does the beneficiary have sufficient strength and postural stability
    to operate a POV/scooter?

    a.  A POV is a 3- or 4-wheeled device with tiller steering and
        limited seat modification capabilities. The beneficiary must be
        able to maintain stability and position for adequate operation.

    b.  The beneficiary\'s home should provide adequate access,
        maneuvering space and surfaces for the operation of a POV.

    c.  Assess the beneficiary's ability to safely use a POV/scooter.

9.  Are the additional features provided by a power wheelchair needed to
    allow the beneficiary to participate in one or more MRADLs?

    a.  The pertinent features of a power wheelchair compared to a POV
        are typically control by a joystick or alternative input device,
        lower seat height for slide transfers, and the ability to
        accommodate a variety of seating needs.

    b.  The type of wheelchair and options provided should be
        appropriate for the degree of the beneficiary's functional
        impairments.

    c.  The beneficiary\'s home should provide adequate access,
        maneuvering space and surfaces for the operation of a power
        wheelchair.

    d.  Assess the beneficiary's ability to safely use a power
        > wheelchair.

> **NOTE:** If the beneficiary is unable to use a power wheelchair, and
> if there is a caregiver who is available, willing, and able to provide
> assistance, a manual wheelchair is appropriate. A caregiver's
> inability to operate a manual wheelchair can be considered in covering
> a power wheelchair so that the caregiver can assist the beneficiary.

# - Pneumatic Compression Devices

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 60-16**
>
> Pneumatic compression devices consist of an inflatable garment for the
> arm or leg and an electrical pneumatic pump that fills the garment
> with compressed air. The garment is intermittently inflated and
> deflated with cycle times and pressures that vary between devices.
> Pneumatic devices are covered for the treatment of lymphedema or for
> the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency with venous stasis
> ulcers.

## Lymphedema

> Lymphedema is the swelling of subcutaneous tissues due to the
> accumulation of excessive lymph fluid. The accumulation of lymph fluid
> results from impairment to the normal clearing function of the
> lymphatic system and/or from an excessive production of lymph.
> Lymphedema is divided into two broad classes according to etiology.
> Primary lymphedema is a relatively uncommon, chronic condition which
> may be due to such causes as Milroy's Disease or congenital anomalies.
> Secondary lymphedema which is much more common, results from the
> destruction of or damage to formerly functioning lymphatic channels,
> such as surgical removal of lymph nodes or post radiation fibrosis,
> among other causes.
>
> Pneumatic compression devices are covered in the home setting for the
> treatment of lymphedema if the patient has undergone a four-week trial
> of conservative therapy and the treating physician determines that
> there has been no significant improvement or if significant symptoms
> remain after the trial. The trial of conservative therapy must include
> use of an appropriate compression bandage system or compression
> garment, exercise, and elevation of the limb. The garment may be
> prefabricated or custom-fabricated but must provide adequate graduated
> compression.

## Chronic Venous Insufficiency With Venous Stasis Ulcers

> Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) of the lower extremities is a
> condition caused by abnormalities of the venous wall and valves,
> leading to obstruction or reflux of blood flow in the veins. Signs of
> CVI include hyperpigmentation, stasis dermatitis, chronic edema, and
> venous ulcers.
>
> Pneumatic compression devices are covered in the home setting for the
> treatment of CVI of the lower extremities only if the patient has one
> or more venous stasis ulcer(s) which have failed to heal after a six
> month trial of conservative therapy directed by the treating
> physician. The trial of conservative therapy must include a
> compression bandage system or compression garment, appropriate
> dressings for the wound, exercise, and elevation of the limb.

## General Coverage Criteria

> Pneumatic compression devices are covered only when prescribed by a
> physician and when they are used with appropriate physician oversight,
> i.e., physician evaluation of the patient's condition to determine
> medical necessity of the device, assuring suitable instruction in the
> operation of the machine, a treatment plan defining the pressure to be
> used and the frequency and duration of use, and ongoing monitoring of
> use and response to treatment.
>
> The determination by the physician of the medical necessity of a
> pneumatic compression device must include:

1.  The patient's diagnosis and prognosis;

2.  Symptoms and objective findings, including measurements which
    establish the severity of the condition;

3.  The reason the device is required, including the treatments which
    have been tried and failed; and

4.  The clinical response to an initial treatment with the device.

> The clinical response includes the change in pretreatment
> measurements, ability to tolerate the treatment session and
> parameters, and ability of the patient (or caregiver) to apply the
> device for continued use in the home.
>
> The only time that a segmented, calibrated gradient pneumatic
> compression device (HCPCS code E0652) would be covered is when the
> individual has unique characteristics that prevent them from receiving
> satisfactory pneumatic compression treatment using a nonsegmented
> device in conjunction with a segmented appliance or a segmented
> compression device without manual control of pressure in each chamber.

# - Hospital Beds

## (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

A.  **General Requirements for Coverage of Hospital Beds**

> A physician's prescription and such additional documentation as the
> DME MAC medical staff may consider necessary, including medical
> records and physicians' reports, must establish the medical necessity
> for a hospital bed due to one of the following reasons:

-   The patient's condition requires positioning of the body; e.g., to
    alleviate pain, promote good body alignment, prevent contractures,
    avoid respiratory infections, in ways not feasible in an ordinary
    bed; or

-   The patient's condition requires special attachments that cannot be
    fixed and used on an ordinary bed.

## Physician's Prescription

> The physician's prescription which must accompany the initial claim,
> and supplementing documentation when required, must establish that a
> hospital bed is medically necessary. If the
>
> stated reason for the need for a hospital bed is the patient's
> condition requires positioning, the prescription or other
> documentation must describe the medical condition, e.g., cardiac
> disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, quadriplegia or
> paraplegia, and also the severity and frequency of the symptoms of the
> condition that necessitates a hospital bed for positioning.
>
> If the stated reason for requiring a hospital bed is the patient's
> condition requires special attachments, the prescription must describe
> the patient's condition and specify the attachments that require a
> hospital bed.

## Variable Height Feature

> In well documented cases, the DME MAC medical staff may determine that
> a variable height feature of a hospital bed, approved for coverage
> under subsection A above, is medically necessary and, therefore,
> covered, for one of the following conditions:

-   Severe arthritis and other injuries to lower extremities; e.g.,
    fractured hip - The condition requires the variable height feature
    to assist the patient to ambulate by enabling the patient to place
    his or her feet on the floor while sitting on the edge of the bed;

-   Severe cardiac conditions - For those cardiac patients who are able
    > to leave bed, but who must avoid the strain of "jumping" up or
    > down;

-   Spinal cord injuries, including quadriplegic and paraplegic
    > patients, multiple limb amputee and stroke patients. For those
    > patients who are able to transfer from bed to a wheelchair, with
    > or without help; or,

-   Other severely debilitating diseases and conditions, if the variable
    > height feature is required to assist the patient to ambulate.

## Electric Powered Hospital Bed Adjustments

> Electric powered adjustments to lower and raise head and foot may be
> covered when the DME MAC medical staff determines that the patient's
> condition requires frequent change in body position and/or there may
> be an immediate need for a change in body position (i.e., no delay can
> be tolerated) and the patient can operate the controls and cause the
> adjustments. Exceptions may be made to this last requirement in cases
> of spinal cord injury and brain damaged patients.

## Side Rails

> If the patient's condition requires bed side rails, they can be
> covered when an integral part of, or []{#_bookmark112 .anchor}an
> accessory to, a hospital bed.

# - Air-Fluidized Bed

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 60-19**
>
> Air fluidized beds are covered for services rendered on or after: July
> 30, 1990.
>
> An air-fluidized bed uses warm air under pressure to set small ceramic
> beads in motion which simulate the movement of fluid. When the patient
> is placed in the bed, his body weight is evenly distributed over a
> large surface area which creates a sensation of "floating." Medicare
> payment for home use of the air-fluidized bed for treatment of
> pressure sores can be made if such use is reasonable and necessary for
> the individual patient.
>
> A decision that use of an air-fluidized bed is reasonable and
> necessary requires that:

-   The patient has a stage 3 (full thickness tissue loss) or stage 4
    (deep tissue destruction) pressure sore;

-   The patient is bedridden or chair bound as a result of severely
    > limited mobility;

-   In the absence of an air-fluidized bed, the patient would require
    > institutionalization;

-   The air-fluidized bed is ordered in writing by the patient's
    attending physician based upon a comprehensive assessment and
    evaluation of the patient after completion of a course of
    conservative treatment designed to optimize conditions that promote
    wound healing. This course of treatment must have been at least one
    month in duration without progression toward wound healing. This
    month of prerequisite conservative treatment may include some period
    in an institution as long as there is documentation available to
    verify that the necessary conservative treatment has been rendered.

-   Use of wet-to-dry dressings for wound debridement, begun during the
    period of conservative treatment and which continue beyond 30 days,
    will not preclude coverage of air- fluidized bed. Should additional
    debridement again become necessary, while a patient is using an
    air-fluidized bed (after the first 30-day course of conservative
    treatment) that will not cause the air-fluidized bed to become
    noncovered. In all instances documentation verifying the continued
    need for the bed must be available.

-   A trained adult caregiver is available to assist the patient with
    activities of daily living, fluid balance, dry skin care,
    repositioning, recognition and management of altered mental status,
    dietary needs, prescribed treatments, and management and support of
    the air-fluidized bed system and its problems such as leakage;

-   A physician directs the home treatment regimen, and reevaluates and
    recertifies the need for the air-fluidized bed on a monthly basis;
    and

-   All other alternative equipment has been considered and ruled out.

> Conservative treatment must include:

-   Frequent repositioning of the patient with particular attention to
    relief of pressure over bony prominences (usually every 2 hours);

-   Use of a specialized support surface (Group II) designed to reduce
    pressure and shear forces on healing ulcers and to prevent new ulcer
    formation;

-   Necessary treatment to resolve any wound infection;

-   Optimization of nutrition status to promote wound healing;

-   Debridement by any means (including wet to dry dressings-which does
    not require an occlusive covering) to remove devitalized tissue from
    the wound bed;

-   Maintenance of a clean, moist bed of granulation tissue with
    appropriate moist dressings protected by an occlusive covering,
    while the wound heals.

> Home use of the air-fluidized bed is not covered under any of the
> following circumstances:

-   The patient has coexisting pulmonary disease (the lack of firm back
    support makes coughing ineffective and dry air inhalation thickens
    pulmonary secretions);

-   The patient requires treatment with wet soaks or moist wound
    dressings that are not protected with an impervious covering such as
    plastic wrap or other occlusive material;

-   The caregiver is unwilling or unable to provide the type of care
    required by the patient on an air-fluidized bed;

-   Structural support is inadequate to support the weight of the
    air-fluidized bed system (it generally weighs 1600 pounds or more);

-   Electrical system is insufficient for the anticipated increase in
    > energy consumption; or

-   Other known contraindications exist.

> Coverage of an air-fluidized bed is limited to the equipment itself.
> Payment for this covered item may only be made if the written order
> from the attending physician is furnished to the supplier prior to the
> delivery of the equipment. Payment is not included for the caregiver
> or for architectural adjustments such as electrical or structural
> improvement.

# - Prosthetic Shoe

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 70-3**
>
> A prosthetic shoe (a device used when all or a substantial portion of
> the front part of the foot is missing) can be covered as a terminal
> device; i.e., a structural supplement replacing a totally or
> substantially absent hand or foot. The coverage of artificial arms and
> legs includes payment for terminal devices such as hands or hooks even
> though the patient may not require an artificial limb. The function of
> the prosthetic shoe is quite distinct from that of excluded orthopedic
> shoe and supportive foot devices which are used by individuals whose
> feet, although impaired, are essentially intact. (Section
> [[1862(a)(8)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of the
> Act excludes payment for orthopedic shoes or other supportive devices
> for the feet.) See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15,
> "Covered Medical and Other Services," §130.

# - Corset Used as Hernia Support

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 70-1**
>
> A hernia support (whether in the form of a corset or truss) which
> meets the definition of a brace is covered under Part B under
> [[§1861(s)(9)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Act. See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, "Covered
> Medical and Other Services," §130.

# - Sykes Hernia Control

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 70-2**
>
> Based on professional advice, it has been determined that the sykes
> hernia control (a spring-type, U-shaped, strapless truss) is not
> functionally more beneficial than a conventional truss. Make program
> reimbursement for this device only when an ordinary truss would be
> covered. (Like all trusses, it is only of benefit when dealing with a
> reducible hernia). Thus, when a charge for this item is substantially
> in excess of that which would be reasonable for a conventional truss
> used for the same condition, base reimbursement on the reasonable
> charges for the conventional truss. See the Medicare Benefit Policy
> Manual, Chapter 15, "Covered Medical and Other Services,"
>
> §130.

## Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) Pumps (Effective for Services Performed On or after December 17, 2004)

> Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and related
> drugs/supplies are covered as medically reasonable and necessary in
> the home setting for the treatment of diabetic patients who: (1)
> either meet the updated fasting C-Peptide testing requirement, or, are
> beta cell autoantibody positive; and, (2) satisfy the remaining
> criteria for insulin pump therapy as described below. Patients must
> meet either Criterion A or B as follows:
>
> **Criterion A:** The patient has completed a comprehensive diabetes
> education program, and has been on a program of multiple daily
> injections of insulin (i.e., at least 3 injections per day), with
> frequent self-adjustments of insulin doses for at least 6 months prior

> lower limit of normal of the laboratory's measurement method.

-   For patients with renal insufficiency and creatinine clearance
    (actual or calculated from age, gender, weight, and serum
    creatinine) ≤50 ml/minute, insulinopenia is defined as a fasting C-
    peptide level that is less than or equal to 200% of the lower limit
    of normal of the laboratory's measurement method.

-   Fasting C-peptide levels will only be considered valid with a
    concurrently obtained fasting

> glucose ≤225 mg/dL.

-   Levels only need to be documented once in the medical records.

> Continued coverage of the insulin pump would require that the patient

> coverage of all other uses of CSII in accordance with the Category B
> investigational device exemption clinical trials regulation (42 CFR
> 405.201) or as a routine cost under the clinical trials policy
> (Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual 310.1).

## Other Uses

> Other uses of external infusion pumps are covered if the DME MAC
> medical staff verifies the appropriateness of the therapy and the
> prescribed pump for the individual patient.
>
> **NOTE:** Payment may also be made for drugs necessary for the
> effective use of a covered external infusion pump as long as the drug
> being used with the pump is itself reasonable and necessary for the
> patient's treatment.

1.  ## Implantable Infusion Pumps

    a.  **Chemotherapy for Liver Cancer (Effective for Services
        Performed On or After September 26, 1984)**

> The implantable infusion pump is covered for intra-arterial infusion
> of 5-FUdR for the treatment of liver cancer for patients with primary
> hepatocellular carcinoma or Duke's Class D colorectal cancer, in whom
> the metastases are limited to the liver, and where: (1) the disease is
> unresectable, or, (2) the patient refuses surgical excision of the
> tumor.

## Anti-Spasmodic Drugs for Severe Spasticity

> An implantable infusion pump is covered when used to administer
> anti-spasmodic drugs intrathecally (e.g., baclofen) to treat chronic
> intractable spasticity in patients who have proven unresponsive to
> less invasive medical therapy as determined by the following criteria:
>
> As indicated by at least a 6-week trial, the patient cannot be
> maintained on non-invasive methods of spasm control, such as oral
> anti-spasmodic drugs, either because these methods fail to control
> adequately the spasticity or produce intolerable side effects. And
> prior to pump implantation, the patient must have responded favorably
> to a trial intrathecal dose of the anti-spasmodic drug.

## Opioid Drugs for Treatment of Chronic Intractable Pain

> An implantable infusion pump is covered when used to administer opioid
> drugs (e.g., morphine) intrathecally or epidurally for treatment of
> severe chronic intractable pain of malignant or nonmalignant origin in
> patients who have a life expectancy of at least 3 months, and who have
> proven unresponsive to less invasive medical therapy as determined by
> the following criteria:
>
> The patient's history must indicate that he/she would not respond
> adequately to noninvasive methods of pain control, such as systemic
> opioids (including attempts to eliminate physical and
>
> behavioral abnormalities which may cause an exaggerated reaction to
> pain); and a preliminary trial of intraspinal opioid drug
> administration must be undertaken with a temporary
> intrathecal/epidural catheter to substantiate adequately acceptable
> pain relief and degree of side effects (including effects on the
> activities of daily living) and patient acceptance.

## Coverage of Other Uses of Implanted Infusion Pumps

> Determinations may be made on coverage of other uses of implanted
> infusion pumps if the MAC medical staff verifies that:

-   The drug is reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the
    individual patient;

-   It is medically necessary that the drug be administered by an
    implanted infusion pump; and,

-   The Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling for the pump must
    specify that the drug being administered and the purpose for which
    it is administered is an indicated use for the pump.

    a.  ## Implantation of Infusion Pump Is Contraindicated

> The implantation of an infusion pump is contraindicated in the
> following patients:
>
> With a known allergy or hypersensitivity to the drug being used (e.g.,
> oral baclofen, morphine, etc.); or,
>
> Who have an active infection; or,
>
> Whose body size is insufficient to support the weight and bulk of the
> device; or,
>
> With other implanted programmable devices since crosstalk between
> devices may inadvertently change the prescription.
>
> **NOTE:** Payment may also be made for drugs necessary for the
> effective use of an implantable infusion pump as long as the drug
> being used with the pump is itself reasonable and necessary for the
> patient's treatment.

## Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> The following indications for treatment using infusion pumps are not
> covered under Medicare:

## External Infusion Pumps

> **Vancomycin (Effective for Services Beginning On or After September
> 1, 1996)**
>
> Medicare coverage of vancomycin as a durable medical equipment
> infusion pump benefit is not covered. There is insufficient evidence
> to support the necessity of using an external infusion
>
> pump, instead of a disposable elastomeric pump or the gravity drip
> method, to administer vancomycin in a safe and appropriate manner.

2.  ## Implantable Infusion Pump

    a.  **Thromboembolic Disease (Effective for Services Performed On or
        After September 26, 1984)**

> There is insufficient published clinical data to support the safety
> and effectiveness of the heparin implantable pump. Therefore, the use
> of an implantable infusion pump for infusion of heparin in the
> treatment of recurrent thromboembolic disease is not covered.

## Diabetes

> An implanted infusion pump for the infusion of insulin to treat
> diabetes is not covered. The data does not demonstrate that the pump
> provides effective administration of insulin.

## Other

> Not applicable.

## (Rev. 65; Issued: 02-23-07; Effective: 07-27-06; Implementation: 04-02-07)

A.  **General**

> The INDEPENDENCE iBOT 4000 Mobility System is a battery-powered
> mobility device that relies on a computerized system of sensors,
> gyroscopes, and electric motors to allow indoor and outdoor use on
> stairs as well as on level and uneven surfaces. The mobility system
> incorporates a number of different functions, including: a) Standard
> Function that provides mobility on smooth surfaces and inclines at
> home, work, and in other environments; b) 4-Wheel Function that
> provides movement across obstacles, uneven terrain, curbs, grass,
> gravel, and other soft surfaces; c) Balance Function that provides
> mobility in a seated position at an elevated height; d) Stair Function
> that allows for ascent and descent of stairs, with or without
> assistance; and e) Remote Function that assists in the transportation
> of the product while unoccupied. In Standard Function, the
> INDEPENDENCE iBOT 4000 Mobility System functions like a traditional
> power wheelchair. The mobility device can be programmed for Standard
> Function only to meet the assessed needs of the user.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective for services performed on and after July 27, 2006, the
> Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) finds that the evidence
> is sufficient to determine that the Standard Function of the
> INDEPENDENCE iBOT 4000 Mobility System meets the definition of Durable
> Medical Equipment (DME) under section 1861(n) of the Social Security
> Act (the Act) as a
>
> wheelchair used in the patient's home that is reasonable and necessary
> for beneficiaries who have a personal mobility deficit sufficient to
> impair their participation in mobility-related activities of daily
> living (MRADL), such as toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, and
> bathing in customary locations in the home. Determination of the
> presence of a mobility deficit will use an algorithmic process, as
> outlined in Chapter 1, Part 4, Section 280.3 of this manual.

# - Home Health Visits to a Blind Diabetic

## (Rev. 55, Issued: 05-05-06, Effective: 10-01-06, Implementation: 10-02-06)

> Many individuals who are blind and require daily insulin for the
> control of a diabetic condition are able to administer their
> injections without assistance (other than possibly that which may be
> furnished by family members or friends). There are organizations which
> encourage and train blind diabetics, both to fill their own syringes
> and to inject themselves. There are also a number of devices available
> for blind individuals to fill their syringes accurately. However, the
> individuals who may need assistance with prefilling their syringes may
> also require periodic observation and evaluation, even though their
> diabetes is fairly stabilized. In such cases, probably few in number,
> home health services may be required for this purpose.
>
> To qualify for home health benefits, a blind diabetic must be confined
> to his home, under the care of a physician, and in need of either
> skilled nursing services on an intermittent basis or physical therapy
> or speech-language pathology services. Effective July 1, 1981, a
> person may qualify for home health benefits based on his or her need
> for skilled nursing services on an intermittent basis, physical
> therapy, speech-language pathology, or occupational therapy.
>
> Effective December 1, 1981, occupational therapy is eliminated as a
> basis for entitlement to home health services. However, if a person
> has otherwise qualified for home health services because of the need
> for skilled nursing care, physical therapy or speech--language
> pathology, the patient's eligibility for home health services may be
> extended solely on the basis of the continuing need for occupational
> therapy. (See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 7, "Home
> Health Services," §20.) There must be a plan of treatment, established
> and periodically reviewed by a physician, which indicates that there
> is a recurring need for home health services
>
> to supplement the physician's contacts with the patient; e.g., skilled
> nursing visits for observing and determining the need for changes in
> the level and type of care which has been prescribed. (See the
> Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 7, "Home Health Services,"
> §§30.) Once an initial regimen has been established, the frequency of
> need for further home health services can vary greatly from patient to
> patient, depending on their condition and the likelihood of its
> changing. Some may need visits only every 90 days, for example, while
> others may require them much more frequently. If a nurse makes a visit
> to provide skilled services, and also prefills syringes, the purpose
> of the visit which was to provide skilled services, does not change.
>
> However, if the sole purpose of the nurse's visit is to prefill
> insulin syringes for a blind diabetic, it is not a skilled nursing
> visit although it may be reimbursed as such as indicated below.
>
> Filling a syringe can be safely and effectively performed by the
> average nonmedical person without the direct supervision of a licensed
> nurse. Consequently, it would not constitute a skilled nursing service
> even if it is performed by a nurse. (See the Medicare Benefit Policy
> Manual, Chapter 7, "Home Health Services," §30.2.2.) The personal care
> duties normally performed by home health aides include assisting the
> patient with medications ordered by a physician which are ordinarily
> self-administered. (See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 7,
> "Home Health Services," §50.2.)
>
> Performance of such a service by an aide is consistent with the
> Medicare conditions of participation for home health agencies.
> Therefore, home health aide services would be appropriate for those
> blind diabetics who are qualified for home health benefits and who
> cannot fill their syringes. An adequately trained home health aide
> could make intermittent visits, usually on a weekly basis, to the home
> for the purpose of filling that supply of insulin ordered by the
> physician.
>
> If State law, however, precludes a home health aide from prefilling
> insulin syringes, payment may be made for this service as part of the
> cost of skilled nursing services when performed by a nurse for a blind
> diabetic who is otherwise unable to prefill his or her syringes. There
> are no adverse consequences with respect to reimbursement to the home
> health agency for providing the service in this manner.
>
> If State law does not preclude a home health aide from prefilling
> insulin syringes, but the home health agency chooses to send a nurse
> to perform only this task, the visit is reimbursed as if made by a
> home health aide.
>
> **NOTE:** As indicated, to qualify for home health benefits, a patient
> must require skilled nursing services on an intermittent basis or
> physical therapy or speech-language pathology. If a beneficiary does
> not qualify for home health benefits but only needs someone to prefill
> syringes with the correct dosage of insulin, then no program payment
> can be made.

# - Home Health Nurses' Visits to Patients Requiring Heparin Injections

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 90-2**
>
> Professional medical advice indicates that subcutaneous injections of
> low dose heparin can be, under certain circumstances, medically
> accepted therapy for the treatment of recurrent deep venous
> thrombosis, recurrent pulmonary emboli, and other conditions requiring
> long term anticoagulation. The usual drug of choice for these
> conditions is warfarin. Heparin may be substituted for warfarin in
> circumstances such as demonstrated warfarin sensitivity. Heparin is
> now the drug of choice for anticoagulation during pregnancy.
>
> Medicare payment may be made for serial visits by the home health
> nurse to teach the patient or the caring person to give subcutaneous
> injections of low dose heparin if it is prescribed by a physician for
> a homebound patient who:

-   Is pregnant and requires anticoagulant therapy, or

-   Requires treatment for deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary emboli or
    for another condition requiring anticoagulation and documentation
    justifies that the patient cannot tolerate warfarin.

> If the patient or caring person is unable to administer the injection,
> nursing visits to give the injections on a daily basis, 7 days a week,
> for a period of up to 6 months (in the case of pregnancy, visits may
> be made for a period beyond 6 months if reasonable and necessary)
> would be reimbursed by Medicare. Coverage for these services after 6
> months of treatment would be provided only if the prescribing
> physician can justify and document the need for such an extended
> course of treatment. Documentation of need for heparin injections
> beyond 6 months would not be required for pregnant patients who meet
> the homebound criteria.

# - Clinical Trials

# - Routine Costs in Clinical Trials (Effective July 9, 2007)

## (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> Effective for items and services furnished on or after July 9, 2007,
> Medicare covers the routine costs of qualifying clinical trials, as
> such costs are defined below, as well as reasonable and necessary
> items and services used to diagnose and treat complications arising
> from participation in all clinical trials. All other Medicare rules
> apply.
>
> Routine costs of a clinical trial include all items and services that
> are otherwise generally available to Medicare beneficiaries (i.e.,
> there exists a benefit category, it is not statutorily excluded, and
> there is not a national non-coverage decision) that are provided in
> either the experimental or the control arms of a clinical trial
> except:

-   The investigational item or service, itself unless otherwise covered
    outside of the clinical trial;

-   Items and services provided solely to satisfy data collection and
    > analysis needs and that are not used in the direct clinical
    > management of the patient (e.g., monthly CT scans for a condition
    > usually requiring only a single scan); and

-   Items and services customarily provided by the research sponsors
    free-of-charge for any enrollee in the trial.

> Routine costs in clinical trials include:

-   Items or services that are typically provided absent a clinical
    > trial (e.g., conventional care);

-   Items or services required solely for the provision of the
    > investigational item or service (e.g., administration of a
    > non-covered chemotherapeutic agent), the clinically appropriate
    > monitoring of the effects of the item or service, or the
    > prevention of complications; and

-   Items or services needed for reasonable and necessary care arising
    > from the provision of an investigational item or service\--in
    > particular, for the diagnosis or treatment of complications.

> This policy does not withdraw Medicare coverage for items and services
> that may be covered according to local medical review policies (LMRPs)
> or the regulations on category B investigational device exemptions
> found in 42 CFR 405.201-405.215, 411.15, and 411.406. For information
> about LMRPs, refer to [www.lmrp.net,](http://www.lmrp.net/) a
> searchable database of MAC local policies.
>
> For non-covered items and services, including items and services for
> which Medicare payment is statutorily prohibited, Medicare only covers
> the treatment of complications arising from the delivery of the
> non-covered item or service and unrelated reasonable and necessary
> care.
>
> However, if the item or service is not covered by virtue of a national
> non-coverage policy in Pub. 100-03, National Coverage Determination
> (NCD) Manual, and is the focus of a qualifying clinical trial, the
> routine costs of the clinical trial (as defined above) will be covered
> by Medicare but the non-covered item or service, itself, will not.

## Requirements for Medicare Coverage of Routine Costs

> Any clinical trial receiving Medicare coverage of routine costs must
> meet the following three requirements:

-   The subject or purpose of the trial must be the evaluation of an
    > item or service that falls within a Medicare benefit category
    > (e.g., physicians\' service, durable medical equipment, diagnostic
    > test) and is not statutorily excluded from coverage (e.g.,
    > cosmetic surgery, hearing aids).

-   The trial must not be designed exclusively to test toxicity or
    > disease pathophysiology. It must have therapeutic intent.

-   Trials of therapeutic interventions must enroll patients with
    > diagnosed disease rather than healthy volunteers. Trials of
    > diagnostic interventions may enroll healthy patients in order to
    > have a proper control group.

> The three requirements above are insufficient by themselves to qualify
> a clinical trial for Medicare coverage of routine costs. Clinical
> trials also should have the following desirable characteristics;
> however, some trials, as described below, are presumed to meet these
> characteristics and are automatically qualified to receive Medicare
> coverage:

1.  The principal purpose of the trial is to test whether the
    intervention potentially improves the participants\' health
    outcomes;

2.  The trial is well-supported by available scientific and medical
    information or it is intended to clarify or establish the health
    outcomes of interventions already in common clinical use;

3.  The trial does not unjustifiably duplicate existing studies;

4.  The trial design is appropriate to answer the research question
    being asked in the trial;

5.  The trial is sponsored by a credible organization or individual
    capable of executing the proposed trial successfully;

6.  The trial is in compliance with Federal regulations relating to the
    protection of human subjects; and

7.  All aspects of the trial are conducted according to the appropriate
    standards of scientific integrity.

## Qualification Process for Clinical Trials

> Using the authority found in §1142 of the Social Security Act (the
> Act) (cross-referenced in
>
> §1862(a)(1)(E) of the Act), the Agency for Healthcare Research and
> Quality (AHRQ) will convene a multi-agency Federal panel (the
> \"panel\") composed of representatives of the Department of Health and
> Human Services research agencies (National Institutes of Health (NIH),
> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug
> Administration (FDA), AHRQ, and the Office of Human Research
> Protection), and the research arms of the Department of Defense (DOD)
> and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop qualifying
> criteria that will indicate a strong probability that a trial exhibits
> the desirable characteristics listed above. These criteria will be
> easily verifiable, and where possible, dichotomous. Trials that meet
> these qualifying criteria will receive Medicare coverage of their
> associated routine costs. This panel is not reviewing or approving
> individual trials. The multi- agency panel will meet periodically to
> review and evaluate the program and recommend any necessary
> refinements to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).
>
> Clinical trials that meet the qualifying criteria will receive
> Medicare coverage of routine costs after the trial\'s lead principal
> investigator certifies that the trial meets the criteria. This process
> will require the principal investigator to enroll the trial in a
> Medicare clinical trials registry, currently under development.
>
> Some clinical trials are automatically qualified to receive Medicare
> coverage of their routine costs because they have been deemed by AHRQ,
> in consultation with the other agencies represented on the
> multi-agency panel to be highly likely to have the above-listed seven
> desirable characteristics of clinical trials. The principal
> investigators of these automatically qualified trials
>
> do not need to certify that the trials meet the qualifying criteria,
> but must enroll the trials in the Medicare clinical trials registry
> for administrative purposes, once the registry is established.
>
> Effective September 19, 2000, clinical trials that are deemed to be
> automatically qualified are:

1.  Trials funded by NIH, CDC, AHRQ, CMS, DOD, and VA;

2.  Trials supported by centers or cooperative groups that are funded by
    the NIH, CDC, AHRQ, CMS, DOD, and VA;

3.  Trials conducted under an investigational new drug application (IND)
    reviewed by the FDA; and

4.  Drug trials that are exempt from having an IND under 21 CFR
    312.2(b)(1) will be deemed automatically qualified until the
    qualifying criteria are developed and the certification process is
    in place. At that time the principal investigators of these trials
    must certify that the trials meet the qualifying criteria in order
    to maintain Medicare coverage of routine costs. This certification
    process will only affect the future status of the trial and will not
    be used to retroactively change the earlier deemed status.

> The CMS, through the NCD process, through an individualized assessment
> of benefits, risks, and research potential, may determine that certain
> items and services for which there is some evidence of significant
> medical benefit, but for which there is insufficient evidence to
> support a "reasonable and necessary" determination, are only
> reasonable and necessary when provided in a clinical trial that meets
> the requirements defined in that NCD.
>
> Medicare will cover the routine costs of qualifying trials that either
> have been deemed to be automatically qualified, have certified that
> they meet the qualifying criteria, or are required through the NCD
> process, unless CMS's Chief Clinical Officer subsequently finds that a
> clinical trial does not meet the qualifying criteria or jeopardizes
> the safety or welfare of Medicare beneficiaries.
>
> Should CMS find that a trial\'s principal investigator misrepresented
> that the trial met the necessary qualifying criteria in order to gain
> Medicare coverage of routine costs, Medicare coverage of the routine
> costs would be denied under §1862(a)(1)(E) of the Act. In the case of
> such a denial, the Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the trial would
> not be held liable (i.e., would be held harmless from collection) for
> the costs consistent with the provisions of §§1879, 1842(l), or
> 1834(j)(4) of the Act, as applicable. Where appropriate, the billing
> providers would be held liable for the costs and fraud investigations
> of the billing providers and the trial\'s principal investigator may
> be pursued.

> Medicare regulations require Medicare+Choice (M+C) organizations to
> follow CMS NCDs. This NCD raises special issues that require some
> modification of most M+C organizations\' rules governing provision of
> items and services in and out of network. The items and services
> covered under this NCD are inextricably linked to the clinical trials
> with which they are associated and cannot be covered outside of the
> context of those clinical trials. M+C organizations therefore
>
> must cover these services regardless of whether they are available
