# Foreword - Purpose for National Coverage Determinations (NCD)

> **Manual**

## (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

A.  **Purpose**

> The statutory and policy framework within which National Coverage
> Determinations (NCDs) are made may be found in title XVIII of the
> Social Security Act (the Act), and in Medicare regulations and
> rulings. The NCD Manual describes whether specific medical items,
> services, treatment procedures, or technologies can be paid for under
> Medicare.
>
> NCDs have been made on the items addressed in this manual. Decisions
> that items/services are not covered are generally based on
> [[§1862(a)(1)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Act (the "not reasonable and necessary" exclusion) unless
> otherwise specifically noted. Where another statutory authority for
> denial is indicated, that is the authority for denial. Where an
> item/service is stated to be covered, but such coverage is explicitly
> limited to specified indications or specified circumstances, all
> limitations on coverage of the items/services because they do not meet
> those specified indications or circumstances are based on
>
> §1862(a)(1) of the Act. Where coverage of an item/service is provided
> for specified indications or circumstances but is not explicitly
> excluded for others, or where the item/service is not mentioned at all
> in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) NCD Manual the
> Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) has the discretion to make
> the coverage decision, in consultation with its medical staff, and
> with CMS when appropriate, based on the law, regulations, rulings, and
> general program instructions
>
> The coverage determinations in the manual will be revised based on the
> most recent medical and other scientific and technical evidence
> available to CMS.
>
> Other manuals in this system in which coverage-related instructions
> may be found are: Pub 100-02 (Benefit Policy);
>
> Pub 100-04 (Claims Processing);
>
> Pub 100-05 (Medicare Secondary Payer); and Pub 100-08 (Program
> Integrity)
>
> These manuals usually contain more general coverage descriptions
> and/or claims processing instructions. There should be no
> inconsistencies among the instructions in any of these manuals and the
> NCD Manual pertaining to coverage. If any such inconsistencies are
> found, bring them to the attention of CMS, Center for Clinical
> Standards and Quality, Coverage and Analysis Group, Division of
> Operations and Information Management.

## Organization

> The NCD Manual is organized by categories, e.g., medical procedures,
> supplies, diagnostic services. A table of contents is provided at the
> beginning of the manual
>
> designating coverage determination categories. Each subject discussed
> within the category is listed and identified by a number.
>
> The revision transmittal sheet identifies new material and summarizes
> the principal changes. When a change in policy or procedure is
> involved, the background and effective date for the change is
> provided. If, at a later date, the reader wishes to refer to the
> background explanation given on a transmittal sheet, the reader can
> identify the transmittal by its number which appears on each manual
> page.

# - Anesthesia and Pain Management

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**

# - Use of Visual Tests Prior to and General Anesthesia During Cataract Surgery

## Pre-Surgery Evaluations

> Cataract surgery with an intraocular lens (IOL) implant is a high
> volume Medicare procedure. Along with the surgery, a substantial
> number of preoperative tests are available to the surgeon. In most
> cases, a comprehensive eye examination (ocular history and ocular
> examination) and a single scan to determine the appropriate
> pseudophakic power of the IOL are sufficient. In most cases involving
> a simple cataract, a diagnostic ultrasound A-scan is used. For
> patients with a dense cataract, an ultrasound B-scan may be used.
>
> Accordingly, where the only diagnosis is cataract(s), Medicare does
> not routinely cover testing other than one comprehensive eye
> examination (or a combination of a brief/intermediate examination not
> to exceed the charge of a comprehensive examination) and an A-scan or,
> if medically justified, a B-scan. Claims for additional tests are
> denied as not reasonable and necessary unless there is an additional
> diagnosis and the medical need for the additional tests is fully
> documented.
>
> Because cataract surgery is an elective procedure, the patient may
> decide not to have the surgery until later, or to have the surgery
> performed by a physician other than the diagnosing physician. In these
> situations, it may be medically appropriate for the operating
> physician to conduct another examination. To the extent the additional
> tests are considered reasonable and necessary by the A/B MAC\'s
> medical staff, they are covered.

## General Anesthesia

> The use of general anesthesia in cataract surgery may be considered
> reasonable and necessary if, for particular medical indications, it is
> the accepted procedure among ophthalmologists in the local community
> to use general anesthesia.

# - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) for Acute Post-Operative Pain

## (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> The use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for the
> relief of acute post- operative pain is covered under Medicare. TENS
> may be covered whether used as an adjunct to the use of drugs, or as
> an alternative to drugs, in the treatment of acute pain resulting from
> surgery.
>
> The TENS devices, whether durable or disposable, may be used in
> furnishing this service. When used for the purpose of treating acute
> post-operative pain, TENS devices are considered supplies. As such
> they may be hospital supplies furnished inpatients covered under Part
> A, or supplies incident to a physician's service when furnished in
> connection with surgery done on an outpatient basis, and covered under
> Part B.
>
> It is expected that TENS, when used for acute post-operative pain,
> will be necessary for relatively short periods of time, usually 30
> days or less. In cases when TENS is used for longer periods, A/B MACs
> should attempt to ascertain whether TENS is no longer being used for
> acute pain but rather for chronic pain, in which case the TENS device
> may be covered as durable medical equipment as described in §160.27.

# - Inpatient Hospital Pain Rehabilitation Programs

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-21**
>
> Pain rehabilitation programs are an innovative approach to the
> treatment of intractable pain. The goal of such programs is to give a
> patient the tools to manage and control his/her pain and thereby
> improve his/her ability to function independently.
>
> A hospital level pain rehabilitation program is one that employs a
> coordinated multi- disciplinary team to deliver, in a controlled
> environment, a concentrated program that is designed to modify pain
> behavior through the treatment of the physiological, psychological,
> and social aspects of pain. Such programs generally include diagnostic
> testing, skilled nursing, psychotherapy, structured progressive
> withdrawal from pain medications, physical therapy, and occupational
> therapy to restore physical fitness
>
> (mobility and endurance) to a maximal level within the constraints of
> a patient's physical disability, and the use of mechanical devices,
> and/or activities to relieve pain or modify a patient's reaction to it
> (e.g., nerve stimulator, hydrotherapy, massage, ice, systemic muscle
> relaxation training, and diversional activities).
>
> The nurse's responsibility in such pain rehabilitation programs is to
> observe and assess, on a continuing basis, a patient's condition and
> response to the program as reflected by his actions while in the
> nursing unit, and to assure that the atmosphere within the unit is not
> supportive of pain behavior. The day-to-day activities involved in
> carrying out the program are under the general supervision and, as
> needed, direct supervision of a physician.
>
> Since pain rehabilitation programs of a lesser scope than that
> described above would raise a question as to whether the program could
> be provided in a less intensive setting than on an inpatient hospital
> basis, carefully evaluate such programs to determine whether the
> program does, in fact, necessitate a hospital level of care. Some pain
> rehabilitation programs may utilize services and devices which are
> excluded from coverage, e.g., acupuncture dorsal column stimulator,
> and family counseling services. In determining whether the scope of a
> pain program does necessitate inpatient hospital care, evaluate only
> those services and devices which are covered. Although diagnostic
> tests may be an appropriate part of pain rehabilitation programs, such
> tests would be covered in an individual case only where they can be
> reasonably related to a patient's illness, complaint, symptom, or
> injury and where they do not represent an unnecessary duplication of
> tests previously performed.
>
> An inpatient program of 4 weeks' duration is generally required to
> modify pain behavior. After this period, it would be expected that any
> additional rehabilitation services which might be required could be
> effectively provided on an outpatient basis under an outpatient pain
> rehabilitation program (see [§10.4]{.underline}) or other outpatient
> program. The first 7-10 days of such an inpatient program constitute,
> in effect, an evaluation period. If a patient is unable to adjust to
> the program within this period, it is generally concluded that it is
> unlikely that the program will be effective and the patient is
> discharged from the program. On occasions, a program longer than four
> weeks may be required in a particular case. In such a case, there
> should be documentation to substantiate that inpatient care beyond a
> 4-week period was reasonable and necessary. Similarly, where it
> appears that a patient participating in a program is being granted
> frequent outside passes, a question would exist as to whether an
> inpatient program is reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the
> patient's condition.
>
> An inpatient hospital stay for the purpose of participating in a pain
> rehabilitation program would be covered as reasonable and necessary to
> the treatment of a patient's condition where the pain is attributable
> to a physical cause, the usual methods of treatment have not been
> successful in alleviating it, and a significant loss of ability to
> function independently has resulted from the pain. Chronic pain
> patients often have psychological problems which accompany or stem
> from the physical pain, and it is appropriate to include psychological
> treatment in the multi-disciplinary approach. However, patients whose
> pain
>
> symptoms result from a mental condition, rather than from any physical
> cause, generally cannot be successfully treated in a pain
> rehabilitation program.

# - Outpatient Hospital Pain Rehabilitation Programs

## (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> Some hospitals also provide pain rehabilitation programs for
> outpatients. In such programs, services frequently are provided in
> group settings even though they are being furnished pursuant to each
> patient's individualized plan of treatment.
>
> Coverage of services furnished under outpatient hospital pain
> rehabilitation programs, including services furnished in group
> settings under individualized plans of treatment, is available if the
> patient's pain is attributable to a physical cause, the usual methods
> of treatment have not been successful in alleviating it, and a
> significant loss of ability by the patient to function independently
> has resulted from the pain. If a patient meets these conditions and
> the program provides services of the types discussed in
> [§10.3]{.underline}, the services provided under the program may be
> covered. Non-covered services (e.g., vocational counseling, meals for
> outpatients, or acupuncture) continue to be excluded from coverage,
> and A/B MACs would not be precluded from finding, in the case of
> particular patients, that the pain rehabilitation program is not
> reasonable and necessary under
>
> [[§1862(a)(1)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Social Security Act for the treatment of their conditions.

# - Autogenous Epidural Blood Graft

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 45-11**
>
> Autogenous epidural blood grafts are considered a safe and effective
> remedy for severe headaches that may occur after performance of spinal
> anesthesia, spinal taps or myelograms, and are covered. In the
> procedure, blood is removed from the patient's vein and injected into
> his epidural space, to seal the spinal fluid leak and stop the pain.

# - Anesthesia in Cardiac Pacemaker Surgery

## (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> The use of general or monitored anesthesia during transvenous cardiac
> pacemaker surgery may be reasonable and necessary and therefore
> covered under Medicare only if adequate documentation of medical
> necessity is provided on a case-by-case basis. The A/B MAC obtains
> advice from its medical consultants or from appropriate specialty
> physicians or groups in its locality regarding the adequacy of
> documentation before deciding whether a particular claim should be
> covered.
>
> A second type of pacemaker surgery that is sometimes performed
> involves the use of the thoracic method of implantation which requires
> open surgery. Where the thoracic method is employed, general

>

>
> Obstructions which block the flow of blood through the vertebral
> artery can cause vertigo, visual or speech defects, ataxia, mental
> confusion, or stroke. These symptoms in patients result from reduction
> in blood flow to the brain and range from symptoms of transient
> basilar ischemia to mental deterioration or completed stroke.
>
> Five types of surgical procedures are performed to relieve
> obstructions to vertebral artery blood flow. They are:

-   Vertebral artery endarterectomy, a procedure which cleans out
    arteriosclerotic plaques which are inside the vertebral artery;

-   Vertebral artery by-pass or resection with anastomosis or graft;

-   Subclavian artery resection with or without endarterectomy;

-   Removal of laterally located osteophytes anywhere in the C6 (C7)-C2
    course of the vertebral artery; and

-   Arteriolysis which frees the artery from surrounding tissue, with or
    without arteriopexy (fixation of the vessel).

> These procedures can be medically reasonable and necessary, but only
> if each of the following conditions is met:

-   Symptoms of vertebral artery obstruction exist;

-   Other causes have been considered and ruled out;

-   There is radiographic evidence of a valid vertebral artery
    obstruction; and

-   Contraindications to the procedure do not exist, such as coexistent
    obstructions of multiple cerebral vessels.

> Angiograms documenting a valid obstruction should show not only the
> aortic arch with the vessels off the arch, but also show the vessels
> in the neck and head (providing biplane views of the carotid and
> vertebral vascular system). In addition, serial views are needed to
> diagnose "subclavian steal," the condition in which subclavian artery
> obstruction
>
> causes the symptoms of vertebral artery obstruction. Because the
> symptoms are not specific for vertebral artery obstruction, other
> causes must be considered. In addition to vertebral artery
> obstruction, the differential diagnosis should include various
> degenerative disorders of the brain, orthostatic hypotension, acoustic
> neuroma, labyrinthitis, diabetes mellitus and hypoglycemia related
> disorders.
>
> Obstructions which can cause symptoms of blocked vertebral artery
> blood flow and which can be documented by an angiogram include:

-   Intravascular obstructions - arteriosclerotic lesions within the
    vertebral artery or in other arteries.

-   Extravascular obstructions;

-   Bony tissue or osteophytes, located laterally in the C6 (C7)-C2
    cervical vertebral area course of the vertebral artery, most
    commonly at C5 -C6;

-   Anatomical variations - Anomalous location of the origin of the
    vertebral artery, a congenital aberration, and tortuosity and kinks
    of the vertebral artery; to

-   Fibrous tissue - Tissue changed as a result of manipulation of the
    neck for neck pain or injury associated with hematoma; external
    bands, tendinous slings, and fibrous bands.

> The most controversial obstructions include vertebral artery
> tortuosity and kinks and connective tissue along the course of the
> vertebral artery, and variously called external bands, tendinous
> slings and fibrous bands. In the absence of symptoms of vertebral
> artery obstruction, vascular surgeons feel such abnormalities are
> insignificant. Vascular surgery experts, however, agree that these
> abnormalities in very rare cases do cause symptoms of vertebral artery
> obstruction and do necessitate surgical correction.
>
> Vertebral artery construction and vertebral artery surgery are phrases
> which most physicians interpret to include only surgical cleaning
> (endarterectomy) and bypass (resection) procedures. However, some
> physicians who use these terms mean all operative manipulations which
> remove vertebral artery blood flow obstructions. Also, some physicians
> use general terms of vascular surgery, such as endarterectomy, when
> vertebral artery related surgery is performed. Use of the above
> terminology specifies neither the surgical procedure performed nor its
> relationship to the vertebral artery.
>
> Therefore, in developing claims for this type of procedure, require
> specific identification of the obstruction in question and the
> surgical procedure performed. Also, in view of the specific coverage
> criteria given, develop all claims for vertebral artery surgery on a
> case- by-case basis.
>
> Make payment for a surgical procedure listed above if: (1) it is
> reasonable and necessary for the individual patient to have the

# - Transmyocardial Revascularization (TMR)

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-94**
>
> Transmyocardial revascularization (TMR) is a surgical technique which
> uses a laser to bore holes through the myocardium of the heart in an
> attempt to restore perfusion to areas of the heart not being reached
> by diseased or clogged arteries. This technique is used as a late or
> last resort for relief of symptoms of severe angina in patients with
> ischemic heart disease not amenable to direct coronary
> revascularization interventions, such as angioplasty, stenting or open
> coronary bypass.
>
> The precise workings of this technique are not certain. The original
> theory upon which the technique was based, that the open channels
> would result in increased perfusion of the myocardium, does not appear
> to be the major or only action at work. Several theories have been
> proposed, including partial denervation of the myocardium, or the
> triggering of the cascade of biological reactions which encourage
> increased development of blood vessels.
>
> However, research at several facilities indicates that, despite this
> uncertainty, the technique does offer relief of angina symptoms for a
> period of time in patients for whom no other medical treatment
> offering relief is available. Studies indicate that both reduction in
> pain and reduction in hospitalizations are significant for most
> patients treated. Consequently, CMS has concluded that, for patients
> with severe angina (Class III or IV, Canadian Cardiovascular Society,
> or similar classification system) for whom all other medical therapies
> have been tried or evaluated and found insufficient, such therapy
> offers sufficient evidence of its medical effectiveness to treat the
> symptomatology. It is important to note that this technique does not
> provide for increased life expectancy, nor is it proven to affect the
> underlying cause of the angina. However, it appears effective in
> treating the symptoms of angina, and reducing hospitalizations and
> allowing patients to resume some of their normal activities of daily
> living.
>
> The CMS therefore covers TMR as a late or last resort for patients
> with severe (Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification Classes
> III or IV) angina (stable or unstable) which has been found refractory
> to standard medical therapy, including drug therapy at the maximum
> tolerated or maximum safe dosages. In addition, the angina symptoms
> must be caused by areas of the heart not amenable to surgical
> therapies such as percutaneous
>
> transluminal coronary angioplasty, stenting, coronary atherectomy or
> coronary bypass.
>
> Coverage is further limited to those uses of the laser used in
> performing the procedure which have been approved by the Food and Drug
> Administration for the purpose for which they are being used.
>
> Patients would have to meet all of the following additional selection
> guidelines:

-   An ejection fraction of 25 percent or greater;

-   Have areas of viable ischemic myocardium (as demonstrated by
    diagnostic study) which are not capable of being revascularized by
    direct coronary intervention; and

-   Have been stabilized, or have had maximal efforts to stabilize acute
    conditions such as severe ventricular arrhythmias, decompensated
    congestive heart failure or acute myocardial infarction.

> Coverage is limited to physicians who have been properly trained in
> the procedure. Providers of this service must also document that all
> ancillary personnel, including physicians, nurses, operating room
> personnel and technicians, are trained in the procedure and the proper
> use of the equipment involved. Coverage is further limited to
> providers which have dedicated cardiac care units, including the
> diagnostic and support services necessary for care of patients
> undergoing this therapy. In addition, these providers must conform to
> the standards for laser safety set by the American National Standards
> Institute, ANSIZ1363.

# - Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) (Various Effective Dates Below)

## (Rev. 212, Issued: 01-19-19, Effective: 02-19-19, Implementation: 02-19-19)

> The term Medicare beneficiary identifier (Mbi) is a general term
> describing a beneficiary's Medicare identification number. For
> purposes of this manual, Medicare beneficiary identifier references
> both the Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) and the Medicare
> Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) during the new Medicare card transition
> period and after for certain business areas that will continue to use
> the HICN as part of their processes.

## General

> This procedure involves inserting a balloon catheter into a narrow or
> occluded blood vessel to recanalize and dilate the vessel by inflating
> the balloon. The objective of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty
> (PTA) is to improve the blood flow through the diseased segment of a
> vessel so that vessel patency is increased and embolization is
> decreased. With the development and use of balloon angioplasty for
> treatment of atherosclerotic and other vascular stenoses, PTA (with
> and without the placement of a
>
> stent) is a widely used technique for dilating lesions of peripheral,
> renal, and coronary arteries.

## Indications and Limitations of Coverage

B.  **Nationally Covered Indications**

> The PTA is covered when used under the following conditions:

## Treatment of Atherosclerotic Obstructive Lesions

> -In the lower extremities, i.e., the iliac, femoral, and popliteal
> arteries, or in the upper extremities, i.e., the innominate,
> subclavian, axillary, and brachial arteries. The upper extremities do
> not include head or neck vessels.
>
> -Of a single coronary artery for patients for whom the likely
> alternative treatment is coronary bypass surgery and who exhibit the
> following characteristics:

-   Angina refractory to optimal medical management;

-   Objective evidence of myocardial ischemia; and

-   Lesions amenable to angioplasty.

> -Of the renal arteries for patients in whom there is an inadequate
> response to a thorough medical management of symptoms and for whom
> surgery is the likely alternative. PTA for this group of patients is
> an alternative to surgery, not simply an addition to medical
> management.
>
> -Of arteriovenous dialysis fistulas and grafts when performed through
> either a venous or arterial approach.

## Concurrent with Carotid Stent Placement in Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-Approved Category B Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Clinical Trials

> Effective July 1, 2001, Medicare covers PTA of the carotid artery
> concurrent with carotid stent placement when furnished in accordance
> with the FDA-approved protocols governing Category B IDE clinical
> trials. PTA of the carotid artery, when provided solely for the
> purpose of carotid artery dilation concurrent with carotid stent
> placement, is considered to be a reasonable and necessary service when
> provided in the context of such a clinical trial.

## Concurrent with Carotid Stent Placement in FDA-Approved Post-Approval Studies

> Effective October 12, 2004, Medicare covers PTA of the carotid artery
> concurrent with the placement of an FDA-approved carotid stent and an
> FDA-approved or --cleared
>
> embolic protection device (effective December 9, 2009) for an
> FDA-approved indication when furnished in accordance with FDA-approved
> protocols governing post-approval studies. The Centers for Medicare &
> Medicaid Services (CMS) determines that coverage of PTA of the carotid
> artery is reasonable and necessary in these circumstances.

## Concurrent with Carotid Stent Placement in Patients at High Risk for Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA)

> Effective March 17, 2005, Medicare covers PTA of the carotid artery
> concurrent with the placement of an FDA-approved carotid stent with
> embolic protection for the following:

-   Patients who are at high risk for CEA and who also have symptomatic
    > carotid artery stenosis ≥70%. Coverage is limited to procedures
    > performed using FDA- approved carotid artery stenting (CAS)
    > systems and FDA-approved or -cleared (effective December 9, 2009)
    > embolic protection devices. If deployment of the embolic
    > protection device is not technically possible, and not performed,
    > then the procedure is not covered by Medicare (effective December
    > 9, 2009);

-   Patients who are at high risk for CEA and have symptomatic carotid
    > artery stenosis between 50% and 70%, in accordance with the
    > Category B IDE clinical trials regulation (42 CFR 405.201), as a
    > routine cost under the clinical trials policy (Medicare National
    > Coverage Determination (NCD) Manual 310.1), or in accordance with
    > the NCD on CAS post-approval studies (Medicare NCD Manual 20.7);

-   Patients who are at high risk for CEA and have asymptomatic carotid
    artery stenosis ≥80%, in accordance with the Category B IDE clinical
    trials regulation (42 CFR 405.201), as a routine cost under the
    clinical trials policy (Medicare NCD Manual 310.1), or in accordance
    with the NCD on CAS post-approval studies (Medicare NCD Manual
    20.7).

> Coverage is limited to procedures performed using an FDA-approved CAS,
> stents and FDA-approved or -cleared embolic protection devices.
>
> The use of an FDA-approved or cleared embolic protection device is
> required. If deployment of the embolic protection device is not
> technically possible, and not performed, then the procedure is not
> covered by Medicare.
>
> Patients at high risk for CEA are defined as having significant
> comorbidities and/or anatomic risk factors (i.e., recurrent stenosis
> and/or previous radical neck dissection), and would be poor candidates
> for CEA. Significant comorbid conditions include but are not limited
> to:

-   Congestive heart failure (CHF) class III/IV;

-   Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \<30%;

-   Unstable angina;

-   Contralateral carotid occlusion;

-   Recent myocardial infarction (MI);

-   Previous CEA with recurrent stenosis;

-   Prior radiation treatment to the neck; and,

-   Other conditions that were used to determine patients at high risk
    > for CEA in the prior carotid artery stenting trials and studies,
    > such as ARCHER, CABERNET, SAPPHIRE, BEACH, and MAVERIC II.

> Symptoms of carotid artery stenosis include carotid transient ischemic
> attack (distinct focal neurological dysfunction persisting less than
> 24 hours), focal cerebral ischemia producing a non-disabling stroke
> (modified Rankin scale \<3 with symptoms for 24 hours or more), and
> transient monocular blindness (amaurosis fugax). Patients who have had
> a disabling stroke (modified Rankin scale ≥3) shall be excluded from
> coverage.
>
> The determination that a patient is at high risk for CEA and the
> patient's symptoms of carotid artery stenosis shall be available in
> the patient medical records prior to performing any procedure.
>
> The degree of carotid artery stenosis shall be measured by duplex
> Doppler ultrasound or carotid artery angiography and recorded in the
> patient's medical records. If the stenosis is measured by ultrasound
> prior to the procedure, then the degree of stenosis must be confirmed
> by angiography at the start of the procedure. If the stenosis is
> determined to be
>
> \<70% by angiography, then CAS should not proceed.
>
> In addition, CMS has determined that CAS with embolic protection is
> reasonable and necessary only if performed in facilities that have
> been determined to be competent in performing the evaluation,
> procedure and follow-up necessary to ensure optimal patient outcomes.
> Standards to determine competency include specific physician training
> standards, facility support requirements and data collection to
> evaluate outcomes during a required reevaluation.
>
> The CMS has created a list of minimum standards modeled in part on
> professional society statements on competency. All facilities must at
> least meet CMS's standards in order to receive coverage for CAS for
> high-risk patients.

-   Facilities must have necessary imaging equipment, device inventory,
    > staffing, and infrastructure to support a dedicated carotid stent
    > program. Specifically, high- quality x-ray imaging equipment is a
    > critical component of any carotid interventional suite, such as
    > high-resolution digital imaging systems with the capability of
    > subtraction, magnification, road mapping, and orthogonal
    > angulation.

-   Advanced physiologic monitoring must be available in the
    > interventional suite. This includes real time and archived
    > physiologic, hemodynamic, and cardiac rhythm monitoring equipment,
    > as well as support staff who are capable of interpreting the
    > findings and responding appropriately.

-   Emergency management equipment and systems must be readily available
    > in the interventional suite such as resuscitation equipment, a
    > defibrillator, vasoactive and antiarrhythmic drugs, endotracheal
    > intubation capability, and anesthesia support.

-   Each institution shall have a clearly delineated program for
    granting carotid stent privileges and for monitoring the quality of
    the individual interventionalists and the program as a whole. The
    oversight committee for this program shall be empowered to identify
    the minimum case volume for an operator to maintain privileges, as
    well as the (risk-adjusted) threshold for complications that the
    institution will allow before suspending privileges or instituting
    measures for remediation. Committees are encouraged to apply
    published standards from national specialty societies recognized by
    the American Board of Medical Specialties to determine appropriate
    physician qualifications. Examples of standards and clinical
    competence guidelines include those published in the December 2004
    edition of the American Journal of Neuroradiology, and those
    published in the August 18, 2004, Journal of the American College of
    Cardiology.

-   To continue to receive Medicare payment for CAS under this decision,
    the facility or a contractor to the facility must collect data on
    all CAS procedures done at that particular facility. This data must
    be analyzed routinely to ensure patient safety. This data must be
    made available to CMS upon request. The interval for data analysis
    will be determined by the facility but shall not be less frequent
    than every 6 months.

> Since there currently is no recognized entity that evaluates CAS
> facilities, CMS has established a mechanism for evaluating facilities.
> Facilities must provide written documentation to CMS that the facility
> meets one of the following:

1.  The facility was an FDA-approved site that enrolled patients in
    prior CAS IDE trials, such as SAPPHIRE, and ARCHER;

2.  The facility is an FDA-approved site that is participating and
    enrolling patients in ongoing CAS IDE trials, such as CREST;

3.  The facility is an FDA-approved site for one or more FDA post
    approval studies; or,

4.  The facility has provided a written affidavit to CMS attesting that
    the facility has met the minimum facility standards. This should be
    sent to:

> Director, Coverage and Analysis Group 7500 Security Boulevard,
> Mailstop S3-02-01 Baltimore, MD 21244
>
> The letter must include the following information:

-   Facility\'s name and complete address;

-   Facility\'s national provider identifier (formerly referred to as
    the Medicare provider number);

-   Point-of-contact for questions with telephone number;

-   Discussion of how each standard has been met by the hospital;

-   Mechanism of data collection of CAS procedures; and,

-   Signature of a senior facility administrative official.

> A list of certified facilities will be made available and viewable at:
> [[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/coverage/carotid-stent-facilities.asp]{.underline}.](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/coverage/carotid-stent-facilities.asp)
>
> In addition, CMS will publish a list of approved facilities in the
> [Federal]{.underline} [Register]{.underline}.
>
> Facilities must recertify every two (2) years in order to maintain
> Medicare coverage of CAS procedures. Recertification will occur when
> the facility documents that and describes how it continues to meet the
> CMS standards.
>

1.  Enroll facilities in every U.S. state and territory;

2.  Assure data confidentiality and compliance with HIPPA;

3.  Collect the required CMS data elements as listed in the above
    > section;

4.  Assure data quality and data completeness;

5.  Address deficiencies in the facility data collection, quality, and
    > submission;

6.  Validate the data submitted by facilities as needed;

7.  Track long term outcomes such as stroke and death;

8.  Conduct data analyses and produce facility specific data reports and
    > summaries;

9.  Submit data to CMS on behalf of the individual facilities; and

10. Provide quarterly reports to CMS on facilities that do not meet or
    no longer meet the CMS facility certification and recertification
    requirements pertaining to data collection and analysis.

> Registries wishing to receive this designation from CMS must submit

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Conditions under which cardiac pacing is generally considered
> acceptable or necessary, provided that the conditions are chronic or
> recurrent and not due to transient causes such as acute myocardial
> infarction, drug toxicity, or electrolyte imbalance. (In cases where
> there is a rhythm disturbance, if the rhythm disturbance is chronic or

1.  Acquired complete (also referred to as third-degree) AV heart block.

2.  Congenital complete heart block with severe bradycardia (in relation
    to age), or significant physiological deficits or significant
    symptoms due to the bradycardia.

3.  Second-degree AV heart block of Type II (i.e., [no]{.underline}
    progressive prolongation of P-R interval prior to each blocked beat.
    P-R interval indicates the time taken for an impulse to travel from
    the atria to the ventricles on an electrocardiogram).

4.  Second-degree AV heart block of Type I (i.e., progressive
    prolongation of P-R interval prior to each blocked beat) with
    significant symptoms due to hemodynamic instability associated with
    the heart block.

5.  Sinus bradycardia associated with major symptoms (e.g., syncope,
    seizures, congestive heart failure (CHF)); or substantial sinus
    bradycardia (heart rate less than 50) associated with dizziness or
    confusion. The correlation between symptoms and bradycardia must be
    documented, or the symptoms must be clearly attributable to the
    bradycardia rather than to some other cause.

6.  In selected and few patients, sinus bradycardia of lesser severity
    (heart rate 50-59) with dizziness or confusion. The correlation
    between symptoms and bradycardia must be documented, or the symptoms
    must be clearly attributable to the bradycardia rather than to some
    other cause.

7.  Sinus bradycardia is the consequence of long-term necessary drug
    treatment for which there is no acceptable alternative when
    accompanied by significant symptoms (e.g., syncope, seizures, CHF,
    dizziness, or confusion). The correlation between symptoms and
    bradycardia must be documented, or the symptoms must be clearly
    attributable to the bradycardia rather than to some other cause.

8.  Sinus node dysfunction with or without tachyarrhythmias or AV
    conduction block (i.e., the bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome,
    sino-atrial block, sinus arrest) when accompanied by significant
    symptoms (e.g., syncope, seizures, CHF, dizziness, or confusion).

9.  Sinus node dysfunction with or without symptoms when there are
    potentially life- threatening ventricular arrhythmias or tachycardia
    secondary to the bradycardia (e.g., numerous premature ventricular
    contractions, couplets, runs of premature ventricular contractions,
    or ventricular tachycardia).

10. Bradycardia associated with supraventricular tachycardia (e.g.,
    atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or paroxysmal atrial
    tachycardia) with high-degree AV block which is unresponsive to
    appropriate pharmacological management and when the bradycardia is
    associated with significant symptoms (e.g., syncope, seizures, CHF,
    dizziness, or confusion).

11. The occasional patient with hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome
    with syncope due to bradycardia and unresponsive to prophylactic
    medical measures.

12. Bifascicular or trifascicular block accompanied by syncope which is
    attributed to transient complete heart block after other plausible
    causes of syncope have been reasonably excluded.

13. Prophylactic pacemaker use following recovery from acute myocardial
    infarction (MI) during which there was temporary complete
    (third-degree) and/or Mobitz Type II second-degree AV block in
    association with bundle branch block.

14. In patients with recurrent and refractory ventricular tachycardia,
    \"overdrive pacing\" (pacing above the basal rate) to prevent
    ventricular tachycardia.

> (Effective May 9, 1985)

15. Second-degree AV heart block of Type I with the QRS complexes
    prolonged.

## Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> Conditions which, although used by some physicians as a basis for
> permanent cardiac pacing, are considered unsupported by adequate
> evidence of benefit and therefore should not generally be considered
> appropriate uses for single-chamber pacemakers in the absence of the
> above indications. A/B MACs should review claims for pacemakers with
> these indications to determine the need for further claims development
> prior to denying the claim, since additional claims development may be
> required. The object of such further development is to establish
> whether the particular claim actually meets the conditions in a)
> above. In claims where this is not the case or where such an event
> appears unlikely, the A/B MAC may deny the claim:

1.  Syncope of undetermined cause.

2.  Sinus bradycardia without significant symptoms.

3.  Sino-atrial block or sinus arrest without significant symptoms.

4.  Prolonged P-R intervals with atrial fibrillation (without
    third-degree AV block) or with other causes of transient ventricular
    pause.

5.  Bradycardia during sleep.

6.  Right bundle branch block with left axis deviation (and other forms
    of fascicular or bundle branch block) without syncope or other
    symptoms of intermittent AV block).

7.  Asymptomatic second-degree AV block of Type I unless the QRS
    complexes are prolonged or electrophysiological studies have
    demonstrated that the block is at or beyond the level of the His
    bundle (a component of the electrical conduction system of the
    heart).

> Effective October 1, 2001

8.  Asymptomatic bradycardia in post-MI patients about to initiate
    long-term beta-blocker drug therapy.

## Other

> All other indications for single-chamber cardiac pacing for which CMS
> has not specifically indicated coverage remain nationally non-covered,
> except for Category B Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) clinical
> trials, or as routine costs of single- chamber cardiac pacing
> associated with clinical trials, in accordance with section 310.1 of
> the NCD Manual.
>
> [Group II]{.underline}: Dual-Chamber Cardiac Pacemakers -- (Effective
> May 9, 1985)

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Conditions under dual-chamber cardiac pacing are considered acceptable
> or necessary in the general medical community unless conditions 1 and
> 2 under Group II. B., are present:

1.  Patients in who single-chamber (ventricular pacing) at the time of
    pacemaker insertion elicits a definite drop in blood pressure,
    retrograde conduction, or discomfort.

2.  Patients in whom the pacemaker syndrome (atrial ventricular
    asynchrony), with significant symptoms, has already been experienced
    with a pacemaker that is being replaced.

3.  Patients in whom even a relatively small increase in cardiac
    efficiency will importantly improve the quality of life, e.g.,
    patients with CHF despite adequate other medical measures.

4.  Patients in whom the pacemaker syndrome can be anticipated, e.g., in
    young and active people, etc.

> Dual-chamber pacemakers may also be covered for the conditions as
> listed in Group I. A., if the medical necessity is sufficiently
> justified through adequate claims development. Expert physicians
> differ in their judgments about what constitutes appropriate criteria
> for dual-chamber pacemaker use. The judgment that such a pacemaker is
> warranted in the patient meeting accepted criteria must be based upon
> the individual needs and characteristics of that patient, weighing the
> magnitude and likelihood of anticipated benefits against the magnitude
> and likelihood of disadvantages to the patient.

## Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> Whenever the following conditions (which represent overriding
> contraindications) are present, dual-chamber pacemakers are not
> covered:

1.  Ineffective atrial contractions (e.g., chronic atrial fibrillation
    or flutter, or giant left atrium.

2.  Frequent or persistent supraventricular tachycardias,
    [except]{.underline} where the pacemaker is specifically for the
    control of the tachycardia.

3.  A clinical condition in which pacing takes place only intermittently
    and briefly, and which is not associated with a reasonable
    likelihood that pacing needs will become prolonged, e.g., the
    occasional patient with hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome with
    syncope due to bradycardia and unresponsive to prophylactic medical
    measures.

4.  Prophylactic pacemaker use following recovery from acute MI during
    which there was temporary complete (third-degree) and/or Type II
    second-degree AV block in association with bundle branch block.

## Other

> All other indications for dual-chamber cardiac pacing for which CMS
> has not specifically indicated coverage remain nationally non-covered,
> except for Category B IDE clinical trials, or as routine costs of
> dual-chamber cardiac pacing associated with clinical trials, in

# - Cardiac Pacemaker Evaluation Services

## (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> Medicare covers a variety of services for the post-implant follow-up
> and evaluation of implanted cardiac pacemakers. The following
> guidelines are designed to assist A/B MACs in identifying and
> processing claims for such services.
>
> **NOTE:** These new guidelines are limited to lithium battery-powered
> pacemakers, because mercury-zinc battery-powered pacemakers are no
> longer being manufactured and virtually all have been replaced by
> lithium units. A/B MACs still receiving claims for monitoring such
> units should continue to apply the guidelines published in 1980 to
> those units until they are replaced.
>
> There are two general types of pacemakers in current use -
> single-chamber pacemakers which sense and pace the ventricles of the
> heart, and dual-chamber pacemakers which sense and pace both the atria
> and the ventricles. These differences require different monitoring
> patterns over the expected life of the units involved. One fact of

> programmed to pace only the ventricles; this may be done either at the
> time the pacemaker is implanted or at some time afterward. In such
> cases, a dual-chamber unit, when programmed or reprogrammed for
> ventricular pacing, should be treated as a single-chamber pacemaker in
> applying screening guidelines.
>
> The decision as to how often any patient's pacemaker should be
> monitored is the responsibility of the patient's physician who is best
> able to take into account the condition and circumstances of the
> individual patient. These may vary over time, requiring modifications
> of the frequency with which the patient should be monitored. In cases
> where monitoring is done by some entity other than the patient's
> physician, such as a commercial monitoring service or hospital
> outpatient department, the physician's prescription for monitoring is
> required and should be periodically renewed (at least annually) to
> assure that the frequency of monitoring is proper for the patient.
> Where a patient is monitored both during clinic visits and
> transtelephonically, the A/B MAC should be sure to include frequency
> data on both types of monitoring in evaluating the reasonableness of
> the frequency of monitoring services received by the patient.
>
> Since there are over 200 pacemaker models in service at any given
> point, and a variety of patient conditions that give rise to the need
> for pacemakers, the question of the appropriate frequency of
> monitoring is a complex one. Nevertheless, it is possible to develop

> fall and
>
> A/B MACs should do this, using their own data and experience, as well
> as the frequency guidelines which follow, in order to limit extensive
> claims development to those cases requiring special attention.

1.  []{#_bookmark17 .anchor}**- Transtelephonic Monitoring of Cardiac
    Pacemakers (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon
    Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of
    ICD-10)**

## General

> Transtelephonic monitoring of pacemakers is furnished by commercial
> suppliers, hospital outpatient departments, and physicians' offices.
>
> Telephone monitoring of cardiac pacemakers as described below is
> medically efficacious in identifying early signs of possible pacemaker
> failure, thus reducing the number of sudden pacemaker failures
> requiring emergency replacement. All systems that monitor the
> pacemaker rate (bpm) in both the free-running and/or magnetic mode are
> effective in detecting subclinical pacemaker failure due to battery
> depletion. More sophisticated systems are also capable of detecting
> internal electronic problems within the pulse generator itself and
> other potential problems. In the case of dual-chamber pacemakers in
> particular, such monitoring may detect failure of synchronization of
> the atria and ventricles, and the need for adjustment and
> reprogramming of the device.
>
> **NOTE:** The transmitting device furnished to the patient is simply
> one component of the diagnostic system, and is not covered as durable
> medical equipment. Those engaged in transtelephonic pacemaker
> monitoring should reflect the costs of the transmitters in setting
> their charges for monitoring.

## Definition of Transtelephonic Monitoring

> In order for transtelephonic monitoring services to be covered, the
> services must consist of the following elements:

-   A minimum 30-second readable strip of the pacemaker in the
    free-running mode;

-   Unless contraindicated, a minimum 30-second readable strip of the
    pacemaker in the magnetic mode; and,

-   A minimum 30 seconds of readable ECG strip.

## Frequency Guidelines for Transtelephonic Monitoring

> The guidelines below constitute a system which A/B MACs should use, in
> conjunction with their knowledge of local medical practices, to screen
> claims for transtelephonic monitoring prior to payment. It is
> important to note that they are not recommendations with respect to a
> minimum frequency for such monitorings, but rather a maximum
>
> frequency (within which payment may be made without further claims
> development). As with previous guidelines, more frequent monitorings
> may be covered in cases where A/B MACs are satisfied that such
> monitorings are medically necessary; e.g., based on the condition of
> the patient, or with respect to pacemakers exhibiting unexpected
> defects or premature failure. A/B MACs should seek written
> justification for more frequent monitorings from the patient's
> physician and/or any monitoring service involved.
>
> These guidelines are divided into two broad categories - Guideline I
> which will apply to the majority of pacemakers now in use, and
> Guideline II which will apply only to pacemaker systems (pacemaker and
> leads) for which sufficient long-term clinical information exists to
> assure that they meet the standards of the Inter-Society Commission
> for Heart Disease Resources (ICHD) for longevity and end-of-life
> decay. (The ICHD standards are: (1) 90% cumulative survival at 5 years
> following implant; and (2) an end- of-life decay of less than a 50%
> drop of output voltage and less than 20% deviation of magnet rate, or
> a drop of 5 beats per minute or less, over a period of 3 months or
> more.) A/B MACs should consult with their medical advisers and other
> appropriate individuals and organizations (such as the North American
> Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology which publishes product
> reliability information) should questions arise over whether a
> pacemaker system meets the ICHD standards.
>
> The two groups of guidelines are then further broken down into two
> general categories -- single-chamber and dual-chamber pacemakers. A/B
> MACs should be aware that the frequency with which a patient is
> monitored may be changed from time-to-time for a number of reasons,
> such as a change in the patient's overall condition, a reprogramming
> of the patient's pacemaker, the development of better information on
> the pacemaker's longevity or failure mode, etc. Consequently, changes
> in the proper set of guidelines may be required. A/B MACs should
> inform physicians and monitoring services to alert A/B MACs to any
> changes in the patient's monitoring prescription that might
> necessitate changes in the screening guidelines applied to that
> patient. (Of particular importance is the reprogramming of a
> dual-chamber pacemaker to a single-chamber mode of operation. Such
> reprogramming would shift the patient from the appropriate
> dual-chamber guideline to the appropriate single-chamber guideline.)
>
> Guideline I

1.  \- Single-chamber pacemakers 1st month - every 2 weeks.

> 2nd through 36th month - every 8 weeks. 37th month to failure - every
> 4 weeks.

2.  \- Dual-chamber pacemaker

> 1st month - every 2 weeks.
>
> 2nd through 6th month - every 4 weeks. 7th through 36th month - every
> 8 weeks. 37th month to failure - every 4 weeks.
>
> Guideline II

1.  \- Single-chamber pacemakers 1st month - every 2 weeks.

> 2nd through 48th month - every 12 weeks. 49th through 72nd month -

>
> 2nd through 30th month - every 12 weeks. 31st through 48th month -

## Pacemaker Clinic Services

1.  General

> Pacemaker monitoring is also covered when done by pacemaker clinics.
> Clinic visits may be done in conjunction with transtelephonic
> monitoring or as a separate service; however, the services rendered by
> a pacemaker clinic are more extensive than those currently possible by
> telephone. They include, for example, physical examination of patients
> and reprogramming of pacemakers. Thus, the use of one of these types
> of monitoring does not preclude concurrent use of the other.

2.  Frequency Guidelines

> As with transtelephonic pacemaker monitoring, the frequency of clinic
> visits is the decision of the patient's physician, taking into
> account, among other things, the medical condition of the patient.
> However, A/B MACs can develop monitoring guidelines that will prove
> useful in screening claims. The following are recommendations for
> monitoring guidelines on lithium-battery pacemakers:

-   For single-chamber pacemakers - twice in the first 6 months
    following implant, then once every 12 months.

-   For dual-chamber pacemakers - twice in the first 6 months, then once
    every 6 months.

# -- Single Chamber and Dual Chamber Permanent Cardiac Pacemakers

## (Rev. 187, Issued: 12-10-15, Effective: 08-13-13, Issued: 01-13-16)

A.  **General**

> Permanent cardiac pacemakers refer to a group of self-contained,
> battery operated, implanted devices that send electrical stimulation
> to the heart through one or more implanted leads. They are often
> classified by the number of chambers of the heart that the devices
> stimulate (pulse or depolarize). Single chamber pacemakers typically
> target either the right atrium or right ventricle. Dual chamber
> pacemakers stimulate both the right atrium and the right ventricle.
>
> The implantation procedure is typically performed under local
> anesthesia and requires only a brief hospitalization. A catheter is
> inserted into the chest and the pacemaker's leads are threaded through
> the catheter to the appropriate chamber(s) of the heart. The surgeon
> then makes a small "pocket" in the pad of the flesh under the skin on
> the upper portion of the chest wall to hold the power source. The
> pocket is then closed with stitches.
>
> The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has determined that
> the evidence is sufficient to conclude that implanted permanent
> cardiac pacemakers, single chamber or dual chamber, are reasonable and
> necessary for the treatment of non-reversible symptomatic bradycardia
> due to sinus node dysfunction and second and/or third degree
> atrioventricular block. Symptoms of bradycardia are symptoms that can
> be directly attributable to a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute

# -- Leadless Pacemakers

## (Rev. 201, Issued: 07-28-17, Effective: 01-18-18, Implementation: 08-29-17- for MAC local edits; January 2, 2018 - for MCS shared edits)

A.  **General**

> The leadless pacemaker eliminates the need for a device pocket and
> insertion of a pacing lead which are integral elements of traditional
> pacing systems. The removal of these elements eliminate an important
> source of complications associated with traditional pacing systems
> while providing similar benefits. Leadless pacemakers are delivered
> via catheter to the heart, and function similarly to other transvenous
> single-chamber ventricular pacemakers.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective January 18, 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
> Services (CMS) covers leadless pacemakers through Coverage with
> Evidence Development (CED). CMS covers leadless pacemakers when
> procedures are performed in Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
> approved studies. CMS also covers, in prospective longitudinal
> studies, leadless pacemakers that are used in accordance with the FDA
> approved label for devices that have either:

-   an associated ongoing FDA approved post-approval study; or

-   completed an FDA post-approval study.

> Each study must be approved by CMS and as a fully-described, written
> part of its protocol, must address the following research questions:

-   What are the peri-procedural and post-procedural complications of
    leadless pacemakers?

-   What are the long term outcomes of leadless pacemakers?

-   What are the effects of patient characteristics (age, gender,
    comorbidities) on the use and health effects of leadless pacemakers?

> CMS will review studies to determine if they meet the 13 criteria
> listed below. If CMS determines that they meet these criteria, the
> study will be posted on CMS' CED website
>
> ([[https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coverage/Coverage-with-Evidence-]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coverage/Coverage-with-Evidence-Development/index.html)
> [[Development/index.html]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coverage/Coverage-with-Evidence-Development/index.html)).

a.  The principal purpose of the study is to test whether the item or
    > service meaningfully improves health outcomes of affected
    > beneficiaries who are represented by the enrolled subjects.

b.  The rationale for the study is well supported by available
    > scientific and medical evidence.

c.  The study results are not anticipated to unjustifiably duplicate
    > existing knowledge.

d.  The study design is methodologically appropriate and the anticipated
    > number of enrolled subjects is sufficient to answer the research
    > question(s) being asked in the National Coverage Determination.

e.  The study is sponsored by an organization or individual capable of
    > completing it successfully.

f.  The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal
    > regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found in
    > the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 45 CFR Part 46. If a
    > study is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it
    > is also in compliance with 21 CFR Parts 50 and

> 56\. In addition, to further enhance the protection of human subjects
> in studies conducted under CED, the study must provide and obtain
> meaningful informed consent from patients regarding the risks
> associated with the study items and/or services, and the use and
> eventual disposition of the collected data.

g.  All aspects of the study are conducted according to appropriate
    > standards of scientific integrity.

h.  The study has a written protocol that clearly demonstrates adherence
    > to the standards listed here as Medicare requirements.

i.  The study is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disease
    > pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Such studies may meet this
    > requirement only if the disease or condition being studied is life
    > threatening as defined in 21 CFR §312.81(a) and the patient has no
    > other viable treatment options.

j.  The clinical research studies and registries are registered on the
    [www.ClinicalTrials.gov](http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov/) website by
    the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the
    first study subject. Registries are also registered in the Agency
    for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Registry of Patient
    Registries (RoPR).

k.  The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of
    public release of all prespecified outcomes to be measured including
    release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is terminated
    early. The results must be made public within 12 months of the
    study's primary completion date, which is the date the final subject
    had final data collection for the primary endpoint, even if the
    trial does not achieve its primary aim. The results must include
    number started/completed, summary results for primary and secondary
    outcome measures, statistical analyses, and adverse events. Final
    results must be reported in a publicly accessibly manner; either in
    a peer-reviewed scientific journal (in print or on-line), in an
    on-line publicly accessible registry dedicated to the dissemination

> of clinical trial information such as ClinicalTrials.gov, or in
> journals willing to publish in abbreviated format (e.g., for studies
> with negative or incomplete results).

l.  The study protocol must explicitly discuss beneficiary
    > subpopulations affected by the item or service under
    > investigation, particularly traditionally underrepresented groups
    > in clinical studies, how the inclusion and exclusion criteria
    > effect enrollment of these populations, and a plan for the
    > retention and reporting of said populations in the trial. If the
    > inclusion and exclusion criteria are expected to have a negative
    > effect on the recruitment or retention of underrepresented
    > populations, the protocol must discuss why these criteria are
    > necessary.

m.  The study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are or are
    > not expected to be generalizable to affected beneficiary
    > subpopulations. Separate discussions in the protocol may be
    > necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age,
    > disability or Medicaid eligibility.

>
> Intraoperative ventricular mapping is the technique of recording
> cardiac electrical activity directly from the heart. The recording

-   Localize accessory pathways associated with the
    Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) and other preexcitation syndromes;

-   Map the sequence of atrial and ventricular activation for

# -- Electrocardiographic Services

## (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD- 10)

A.  **General**

    1.  An electrocardiogram (EKG) is a graphic representation of
        electrical activity within the heart. Electrodes placed on the
        body in predetermined locations sense this electrical activity,
        which is then recorded by various means for review and
        interpretation. EKG recordings are used to diagnose a wide range

2.  Ambulatory electrocardiography (AECG) refers to services rendered in
    an outpatient setting over a specified period of time, generally
    while a patient is engaged in daily activities, including sleep.
    AECG devices are intended to provide the physician with documented
    episodes of arrhythmia, which may not be detected using a standard
    12-lead EKG. AECG is most typically used to evaluate symptoms that
    may correlate with intermittent cardiac arrhythmias and/or
    myocardial ischemia. Such symptoms include syncope, dizziness, chest
    pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath. Additionally, AECG is
    used to evaluate patient response to initiation, revision, or
    discontinuation of arrhythmic drug therapy.

3.  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), through the
    national coverage determination (NCD) process, may create new
    ambulatory EKG monitoring device categories if published,
    peer-reviewed clinical studies demonstrate evidence of

> improved clinical utility, or equal utility with additional advantage
> to the patient, as indicated by improved patient management and/or
> improved health outcomes in the Medicare population (such as superior
> ability to detect serious or life-threatening arrhythmias) as compared
> to devices or services in the currently described categories below.

## Descriptions of Ambulatory EKG Monitoring Technologies

1.  Dynamic electrocardiography devices that continuously record a
    real-time EKG, commonly known as Holter™ monitors, typically record
    over a 24-hour period. The recording is captured either on a
    magnetic tape or other digital medium. The data is then
    computer-analyzed at a later time, and a physician interprets the
    computer-generated report. A 24-hour recording is generally adequate
    to detect most transient arrhythmias. Documentation of medical
    necessity is required for monitoring longer than 24 hours. The
    recording device itself is not covered as durable medical equipment
    (DME) separate from the total diagnostic service.

2.  An event monitor, or event recorder, is a patient-activated or
    event-activated EKG device that intermittently records cardiac
    arrhythmic events as they occur. The EKG is recorded on magnetic
    tape or other digital medium.

> Cardiac event monitor technology varies among different devices. For
> patient-activated event monitors, the patient initiates recording when
> symptoms appear or when instructed to do so by a physician (e.g.,
> following exercise). For self-sensing, automatically triggered
> monitors, an EKG is automatically recorded when the device detects an
> arrhythmia, without patient intervention. Some devices permit a
> patient to transmit EKG data transtelephonically (i.e., via telephone)
> to a receiving center where the data is reviewed. A technician may be
> available at these centers to review transmitted data 24 hours per
> day. In some instances, when the EKG is determined to be outside
> certain pre- set criteria by a technician or other non-physician, a
> physician is available 24 hours per day to review the transmitted data
> and to make clinical decisions regarding the patient.
>
> These services are known as "24-hour attended monitoring". In other
> instances, transmitted EKG data is reviewed at a later time and are,
> therefore, considered "non- attended."
>
> Cardiac event monitors without transtelephonic capability must be
> removed from the patient and taken to a location for review of the
> stored EKG data. Some devices also permit a \"time sampling\" mode of
> operation. The \"time sampling\" mode is not covered under ambulatory
> EKG monitoring technology. Some cardiac event monitoring devices with
> trans-telephonic capabilities require the patient to dial the phone
> number of a central EKG data reception center and initiate
> transmission of EKG data. Other devices use Internet-based in-home
> computers to capture and store EKG data. When such devices detect
> pre-programmed arrhythmias, data is automatically sent via modem and
> standard telephone lines to a central receiving center, or independent
> diagnostic testing facility (IDTF), where the data is reviewed.
> Internet-based in-home computer systems may also
>
> provide the receiving center with a daily computer-generated report
> that summarizes 24 hours of EKG data.
>
> Certain cardiac event monitors capture electrical activity with a
> single electrode attached to the skin. Other devices may employ
> multiple electrodes in order to record more complex EKG tracings.
> Additionally, devices may be individually programmed to detect
> patient-specific factors, electrode malfunction, or other factors.
> Cardiac event monitors can be further categorized as either
> "pre-event" or "post-event" recorders, based on their memory
> capabilities:

a.  Pre-symptom Memory Loop Recorder (MLR)

> Upon detecting symptoms, the wearer presses a button, which activates
> the recorder to save (i.e., memorize) an interval of pre-symptom EKG
> data along with data during and subsequent to the symptomatic event.
> Self-sensing recorders (also known as event- activated or automatic
> trigger) do not require patient input to capture these data. Single or
> multiple events may be recorded. The device is worn at all times,
> usually for up to 30 days.

-   Implantable (or Insertable Loop) Recorder (ILR)

> Another type of pre-symptom MLR, it is implanted subcutaneously in a
> patient's upper left chest and may remain implanted for many months.
> An ILR is used when syncope is thought to be cardiac-related, but is
> too infrequent to be detected by either a Holter™ monitor or a
> traditional pre-symptom MLR.

b.  Post-symptom Recorder

> The patient temporarily places this device against the chest when
> symptoms occur and activates it by pressing a button. These recorders
> represent old technology, as they do not include a memory loop. The
> device transmits EKG data telephonically in real-time and is usually
> used for up to 30 days.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> The following indications are covered nationally unless otherwise
> indicated:

1.  Computer analysis of EKGs when furnished in a setting and under the
    circumstances required for coverage of other EKG services.

2.  EKG services rendered by an IDTF, including physician review and
    interpretation. Separate physician services are not covered unless
    he/she is the patient's attending or consulting physician.

3.  Emergency EKGs (i.e., when the patient is or may be experiencing a
    life- threatening event) performed as a laboratory or diagnostic
    service by a portable x-ray

> supplier only when a physician is in attendance at the time the
> service is performed or immediately thereafter.
>
> 4 Home EKG services with documentation of medical necessity.

5.  Transtelephonic EKG transmissions (effective March 1, 1980) as a
    diagnostic service for the indications described below, when
    performed with equipment meeting the standards described below,
    subject to the limitations and conditions specified below. Coverage
    is further limited to the amounts payable with respect to the
    physician's service in interpreting the results of such
    transmissions, including charges for rental of the equipment. The
    device used by the beneficiary is part of a total diagnostic system
    and is not considered DME separately. Covered uses are to:

    a.  Detect, characterize, and document symptomatic transient
        arrhythmias;

    b.  Initiate, revise, or discontinue arrhythmic drug therapy; or,

    c.  Carry-out early post-hospital monitoring of patients discharged
        after myocardial infarction (MI); (only if 24-hour coverage is
        provided, see C.5. below).

> Certain uses other than those specified above may be covered if, in
> the judgment of the local A/B MAC, such use is medically necessary.
>
> Additionally, the transmitting devices must meet at least the
> following criteria:

a.  They must be capable of transmitting EKG Leads, I, II, or III; and,

b.  The tracing must be sufficiently comparable to a conventional EKG.

> 24-hour attended coverage used as early post-hospital monitoring of
> patients discharged after MI is only covered if provision is made for
> such 24-hour attended coverage in the manner described below:
>
> 24-hour attended coverage means there must be, at a monitoring site or
> central data center, an EKG technician or other non-physician,
> receiving calls and/or EKG data; tape recording devices do not meet
> this requirement. Further, such technicians should have immediate,
> 24-hour access to a physician to review transmitted data and make
> clinical decisions regarding the patient. The technician should also
> be instructed as to when and how to contact available facilities to
> assist the patient in case of emergencies.

## Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> The following indications are non-covered nationally unless otherwise
> specified below:

1.  The time-sampling mode of operation of ambulatory EKG cardiac event
    monitoring/recording.

2.  Separate physician services other than those rendered by an IDTF
    unless rendered by the patient's attending or consulting physician.

3.  Home EKG services without documentation of medical necessity.

4.  Emergency EKG services by a portable x-ray supplier without a
    physician in attendance at the time of service or immediately
    thereafter.

5.  24-hour attended coverage used as early post-hospital monitoring of
    patients discharged after MI unless provision is made for such
    24-hour attended coverage in the manner described in section B.5.
    above.

6.  Any marketed Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ambulatory
    cardiac monitoring device or service that cannot be categorized
    according to the framework below.

# - Cardiac Output Monitoring By Thoracic Electrical Bioimpedance (TEB) -- Various Effective Dates Below

## (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

A.  **General**

> Thoracic electrical bioimpedance (TEB) devices, a form of
> plethysmography, monitor cardiac output by non-invasively measuring
> hemodynamic parameters, including: stroke volume, systemic vascular
> resistance, and thoracic fluid status. Under a previous coverage
> determination, effective for services performed on and after July 1,
> 1999, use of TEB was covered for the "noninvasive diagnosis or
> monitoring of hemodynamics in patients with suspected or known
> cardiovascular disease." In reconsidering this policy, the Centers for
> Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) concluded that this use was neither
> sufficiently defined nor supported by available clinical literature to
> offer the guidance necessary for practitioners to determine when TEB
> would be covered for patient management. Therefore, CMS revised its
> coverage policy language in response to a request for reconsideration
> to offer more explicit guidance and clarity for coverage of TEB based
> on a complete and updated literature review.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective for services performed on and after January 23, 2004, TEB is
> covered for the following uses:

1.  Differentiation of cardiogenic from pulmonary causes of acute
    dyspnea when medical history, physical examination, and standard
    assessment tools provide insufficient information, and the treating
    physician has determined that TEB hemodynamic data are necessary for
    appropriate management of the patient.

2.  Optimization of atrioventricular (A/V) interval for patients with
    A/V sequential cardiac pacemakers when medical history, physical
    examination, and standard assessment tools provide insufficient
    information, and the treating physician has determined that TEB
    hemodynamic data are necessary for appropriate management of the
    patient.

3.  Monitoring of continuous inotropic therapy for patients with
    terminal congestive heart failure, when those patients have chosen
    to die with comfort at home, or for patients waiting at home for a
    heart transplant.

4.  Evaluation for rejection in patients with a heart transplant as a
    predetermined alternative to a myocardial biopsy. Medical necessity
    must be documented should a biopsy be performed after TEB.

5.  Optimization of fluid management in patients with congestive heart
    failure when medical history, physical examination, and standard
    assessment tools provide insufficient information, and the treating
    physician has determined that TEB hemodynamic data are necessary for
    appropriate management of the patient.

C.  ## Nationally Non-Covered Indications

    1.  TEB is non-covered when used for patients:

        a.  With proven or suspected disease involving severe
            > regurgitation of the aorta;

        b.  With minute ventilation (MV) sensor function pacemakers,
            > since the device may adversely affect the functioning of
            > that type of pacemaker;

        c.  During cardiac bypass surgery; or,

        d.  In the management of all forms of hypertension (with the
            > exception of drug- resistant hypertension as outlined
            > below).

    2.  All other uses of TEB not otherwise specified remain
        non-covered.

D.  ## Other

> A/B MACs have discretion to determine whether the use of TEB for the
> management of drug-resistant hypertension is reasonable and necessary.
> Drug resistant hypertension is defined as failure to achieve goal
> blood pressure in patients who are adhering to full doses of an
> appropriate 3-drug regimen that includes a diuretic. Effective
> November 24, 2006, after reconsideration of Medicare policy, CMS will
> continue current Medicare policy for TEB.

# - Noninvasive Tests of Carotid Function

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 50-37**
>
> Noninvasive tests of carotid function aid physicians in studying and
> diagnosing carotid disease. There are varieties of these tests which
> measure various anatomical and physiological aspects of carotid
> function, including pressure (systolic, diastolic, and pulse), flow,
> collateral circulation, and turbulence.
>
> For operational purposes, it is useful to classify noninvasive tests
> of carotid function into direct and indirect tests. The direct tests
> examine the anatomy and physiology of the carotid artery, while the
> indirect tests examine hemodynamic changes in the distal beds of the
> carotid artery (the orbital and cerebral circulations).
>
> It is important to note that the names of these tests are not
> standardized. Following are some of the acceptable tests, recognizing
> that this list is not inclusive and that local medical consultants
> should make determinations:

## Direct Tests

-   Carotid Phonoangiography

-   Direct Bruit Analysis

-   Spectral Bruit Analysis

-   Doppler Flow Velocity

-   Ultrasound Imaging including Real Time

-   B-Scan and Doppler Devices

## Indirect Tests

-   Periorbital Directional Doppler Ultrasonography

-   Oculoplethysmography

-   Ophthalmodynamometry

    1.  # - Carotid Body Resection/Carotid Body Denervation

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-7**
>
> Carotid body resection is occasionally used to relieve pulmonary
> symptoms, including asthma, but has been shown to lack general
> acceptance of the professional medical community. In addition,
> controlled clinical studies establishing the safety and effective-
> ness of this procedure are needed. Therefore, all carotid body
> resections to relieve pulmonary symptoms must be considered
> investigational and cannot be considered reasonable and necessary
> within the meaning of
> [[§1862(a)(l)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Act. No program reimbursement may be made in such cases.
>
> However, there is one instance where carotid body resection has been
> accepted by the medical community as effective. That instance is when
> evidence of a mass in the carotid body, with or without symptoms,
> indicates the need for surgery to remove the carotid body tumor.
>
> Denervation of a carotid sinus to treat hypersensitive carotid sinus
> reflex is another procedure performed in the area of the carotid body.
> In the case of hypersensitive carotid sinus, light pressure on the
> upper part of the neck (such as might be experienced when turning or
> raising one's head) results in symptoms such as dizziness or syncope
> due to hypotension and slowed heart rate. Failure of medical therapy
> and continued deterioration in the condition of the patient in such
> cases may indicate need for surgery.
>
> Denervation of the carotid sinus is rarely performed, but when elected
> as the therapy of choice with the above indications, this procedure
> may be considered reasonable and necessary.

# - Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 50-42**
>
> Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) involves the use of a
> noninvasive device which is used to measure blood pressure in 24-hour
> cycles. These 24-hour measurements are stored in the device and are
> later interpreted by the physician. ABPM must be performed for at
> least 24 hours to meet coverage criteria.
>
> The ABPM is only covered for those patients with suspected white coat
> hypertension. Suspected white coat hypertension is defined as

1.  Office blood pressure \> 140/90 mm Hg on at least three separate
    clinic/office visits with two separate measurements made at each
    visit;

2.  At least two documented blood pressure measurements taken outside
    the office which are \< 140/90 mm Hg; and

3.  No evidence of end-organ damage.

> The information obtained by ABPM is necessary in order to determine
> the appropriate management of the patient. ABPM is not covered for any
> other uses. In the rare circumstance that ABPM needs to be performed
> more than once in a patient, the qualifying criteria described above
> must be met for each subsequent ABPM test. For those patients that
> undergo ABPM and have an ambulatory blood pressure of \< 135/85 with
> no evidence of end-organ damage, it is likely that their
> cardiovascular risk is similar to that of normotensives. They should
> be followed over time. Patients for which ABPM demonstrates a blood
> pressure of \> 135/85 may be at increased cardiovascular risk, and a
> physician may wish to consider antihypertensive therapy.

# - External Counterpulsation (ECP) Therapy for Severe Angina (Effective March 20, 2006)

## (Rev. 50, Issued: 03-31-06; Effective: 03-20-06; Implementation: 04-03-06)

A.  **General**

> External counterpulsation (ECP), commonly referred to as enhanced
> external counterpulsation, is a noninvasive outpatient treatment for
> coronary artery disease refractory to medical and/or surgical therapy.
> Although ECP devices are cleared by the Food and Drug Administration
> (FDA) for use in treating a variety of cardiac conditions, including
> stable or unstable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction and
> cardiogenic shock, the use of this device to treat cardiac conditions
> other than stable angina pectoris is not covered, since only that use
> has developed sufficient evidence to demonstrate its medical
> effectiveness. Non-coverage of hydraulic versions of these types of
> devices remains in force.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective for services performed on or after July 1, 1999, coverage is
> provided for the use of ECP for patients who have been diagnosed with
> disabling angina (Class III or Class IV, Canadian Cardiovascular
> Society Classification or equivalent classification) who, in the
> opinion of a cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon, are not readily
> amenable to surgical intervention, such as PTCA or cardiac bypass,
> because:

1.  Their condition is inoperable, or at high risk of operative
    complications or post- operative failure;

2.  Their coronary anatomy is not readily amenable to such procedures;
    > or

3.  They have co-morbid states that create excessive risk.

> A full course of therapy usually consists of 35 one-hour treatments
> which may be offered once or twice daily, usually 5 days per week. The
> patient is placed on a treatment table where their lower trunk and
> lower extremities are wrapped in a series of three compressive air
> cuffs which inflate and deflate in synchronization with the patient's
> cardiac cycle.
>
> During diastole, the three sets of air cuffs are inflated sequentially
> (distal to proximal) compressing the vascular beds within the muscles
> of the calves, lower thighs and upper thighs. This action results in
> an increase in diastolic pressure, generation of retrograde arterial
> blood flow and an increase in venous return. The cuffs are deflated
> simultaneously just prior to systole which produces a rapid drop in
> vascular impedance, a decrease in ventricular workload and an increase
> in cardiac output.
>
> The augmented diastolic pressure and retrograde aortic flow appear to
> improve myocardial perfusion, while systolic unloading appears to
> reduce cardiac workload and oxygen requirements. The increased venous
> return coupled with enhanced systolic flow appears to increase cardiac
> output. As a result of this treatment, most patients experience
> increased time until onset of ischemia, increased exercise tolerance,
> and a reduction in the number and severity of anginal episodes.
> Evidence was presented that this effect lasted well beyond the
> immediate post-treatment phase, with patients symptom-free for several
> months to 2 years. This procedure must be done under direct
> supervision of a physician.

## Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> All other cardiac conditions not otherwise specified as nationally

# - Chelation Therapy for Treatment of Atherosclerosis

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-64**
>
> Chelation therapy is the application of chelation techniques for the
> therapeutic or preventive effects of removing unwanted metal ions from
> the body. The application of chelation therapy using
> ethylenediamine-tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) for the treatment and
> prevention of atherosclerosis is controversial. There is no widely
> accepted rationale to explain the beneficial effects attributed to
> this therapy. Its safety is questioned and its clinical effectiveness
> has never been established by well-designed, controlled clinical
> trials. It is not widely accepted and practiced by American
> physicians. EDTA chelation therapy for atherosclerosis is considered
> experimental. For these reasons, EDTA
>
> chelation therapy for the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis
> is not covered. Some practitioners refer to this therapy as
> chemoendarterectomy and may also show a diagnosis other than
> atherosclerosis, such as arteriosclerosis or calcinosis. Claims
> employing such variant terms should also be denied under this section.
>
> Cross-reference: [§20.22]{.underline}.

# - Ethylenediamine-Tetra-Acetic (EDTA) Chelation Therapy for Treatment of Atherosclerosis

>
> **CIM 45-20**
>
> The use of EDTA as a chelating agent to treat atherosclerosis,

# - Fabric Wrapping of Abdominal Aneurysms

## (Rev. 1, 10-03-03)

> **Not Covered CIM 35-34**
>
> Fabric wrapping of abdominal aneurysms is not a covered Medicare
> procedure. This is a treatment for abdominal aneurysms which involves
> wrapping aneurysms with cellophane or fascia lata. This procedure has
> not been shown to prevent eventual rupture. In extremely rare
> instances, external wall reinforcement may be indicated when the
> current accepted treatment (excision of the aneurysm and
> reconstruction with synthetic materials) is not a viable alternative,
> but external wall reinforcement is not fabric wrapping.
>
> Accordingly, fabric wrapping of abdominal aneurysms is not considered
> reasonable and necessary within the meaning of

# - Displacement Cardiography

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 50-50**
>
> Displacement cardiography, including cardiokymography and
> photokymography, is a noninvasive diagnostic test used in evaluating

## Cardiokymography

> Cardiokymography is covered for services rendered on or after October
> 12, 1988.
>
> Cardiokymography is a covered service only when it is used as an
> adjunct to electrocardiographic stress testing in evaluating coronary
> artery disease and only when the following clinical indications are
> present:

-   For male patients, atypical angina pectoris or nonischemic chest
    > pain; or

-   For female patients, angina, either typical or atypical.

## Photokymography - Not Covered

## Not Covered

> Partial ventriculectomy, also known as ventricular reduction,
> ventricular remodeling, or heart volume reduction surgery, was
> developed by a Brazilian surgeon and has been performed only on a
> limited basis in the United States. This procedure is performed on
> patients with enlarged hearts due to end-stage congestive heart

# - Cardiointegram (CIG) as an Alternative to Stress Test or Thallium Stress Test

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 50-47**

## Not Covered

> A cardiointegram device consists of a microcomputer which receives
> output from a standard electrocardiogram (EKG) and transforms it to
> produce a graphic representation
>
> of heart electrophysiologic signals. This procedure is used primarily
> as a substitute for Exercise Tolerance Testing with Thallium Imaging
> in patients for whom a resting EKG may be inadequate to identify
> changes compatible with coronary artery disease. Because this device
> is still considered investigational pending additional data on its
> clinical efficacy/sensitivity and value as a diagnostic tool, program
> payment may not be made for its use at this time.

# -- Therapeutic Embolization

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-35**
>
> Therapeutic embolization is covered when done for hemorrhage, and for
> other conditions amenable to treatment by the procedure, when
> reasonable and necessary for the individual patient. Renal
> embolization for the treatment of renal adenocarcinoma continues to be
> covered, effective December 15, 1978, as one type of therapeutic
> embolization, to:

-   Reduce tumor vascularity preoperatively;

-   Reduce tumor bulk in inoperable cases; or

    1.  # -- Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy

## (Rev.203, Issued:11-17-17, Effective:04- 03-17, Implementation: 12-18-17)

> For purposes of coverage under Medicare, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO)
> therapy is a modality in which the entire body is exposed to oxygen
> under increased atmospheric pressure.

## Covered Conditions

> Program reimbursement for HBO therapy will be limited to that which is
> administered in a chamber (including the one man unit) and is limited
> to the following conditions:

1.  Acute carbon monoxide intoxication,

2.  Decompression illness,

3.  Gas embolism,

4.  Gas gangrene,

5.  Acute traumatic peripheral ischemia. HBO therapy is a valuable
    adjunctive treatment to be used in combination with accepted
    standard therapeutic measures when loss of function, limb, or life
    is threatened.

6.  Crush injuries and suturing of severed limbs. As in the previous
    conditions, HBO therapy would be an adjunctive treatment when loss
    of function, limb, or life is threatened.

7.  Progressive necrotizing infections (necrotizing fasciitis),

8.  Acute peripheral arterial insufficiency,

9.  Preparation and preservation of compromised skin grafts (not for
    primary management of wounds),

10. Chronic refractory osteomyelitis, unresponsive to conventional
    medical and surgical management,

11. Osteoradionecrosis as an adjunct to conventional treatment,

12. Soft tissue radionecrosis as an adjunct to conventional treatment,

13. Cyanide poisoning,

14. Actinomycosis, only as an adjunct to conventional therapy when the
    disease process is refractory to antibiotics and surgical treatment,

15. Diabetic wounds of the lower extremities in patients who meet the
    following three criteria:

    a.  Patient has type I or type II diabetes and has a lower extremity

A.  **General**

> Microvolt T-wave Alternans (MTWA) testing is a non-invasive diagnostic
> test that detects minute electrical activity in a portion of the

> in the stratification of patients who may be at risk for sudden
> cardiac death (SCD) from ventricular arrhythmias.
>
> Within patient groups that may be considered candidates for
> implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy, a negative MTWA
> test may be useful in identifying low-risk patients who are unlikely
> to benefit from, and who may experience worse outcomes from, ICD
> placement.
>
> Spectral analysis (SA) is a sensitive mathematical method of measuring
> and comparing time and the ECG signals. It requires specialized
> propriety electrodes to calculate minute T-wave voltage changes.
> Software then analyzes these microvolt changes and produces a report

# - Percutaneous Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC)

## (Rev. 192, Issued: 05-06-16, Effective: 02-08-16, Implementation: 10-03-16)

A.  **General**

> Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), an irregular heartbeat, are at
> an increased risk of stroke. The left atrial appendage (LAA) is a
> tubular structure that opens into the left atrium and has been shown
> to be one potential source for blood clots that can cause strokes.
> While thinning the blood with anticoagulant medications has been
> proven to prevent strokes, percutaneous LAA closure (LAAC) has been
> studied as a non- pharmacologic alternative for patients with AF.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) covers percutaneous
> LAAC for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) through Coverage with
> Evidence Development (CED) with the following conditions:

a.  LAAC devices are covered when the device has received Food and Drug
    > Administration (FDA) Premarket Approval (PMA) for that device's
    > FDA- approved indication and meet all of the conditions specified
    > below:

> The patient must have:

-   A CHADS2 score ≥ 2 (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age
    > \>75,

> Diabetes, Stroke/transient ischemia attack/thromboembolism) or
> CHA2DS2- VASc score ≥ 3 (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥
> 65, Diabetes, Stroke/transient ischemia attack/thromboembolism,
> Vascular disease, Sex category)

-   A formal shared decision making interaction with an independent non-
    > interventional physician using an evidence-based decision tool on
    > oral anticoagulation in patients with NVAF prior to LAAC.
    > Additionally, the shared decision making interaction must be
    > documented in the medical record.

-   A suitability for short-term warfarin but deemed unable to take
    > long-term oral anticoagulation following the conclusion of shared
    > decision making, as LAAC is only covered as a second line therapy
    > to oral anticoagulants. The patient (preoperatively and
    > postoperatively) is under the care of a cohesive,
    > multidisciplinary team (MDT) of medical professionals. The
    > procedure must be furnished in a hospital with an established
    > structural heart disease (SHD) and/or electrophysiology (EP)
    > program.

> The procedure must be performed by an interventional cardiologist(s),
> electrophysiologist(s), or cardiovascular surgeon (s) that meet the
> following criteria:

-   Has received training prescribed by the manufacturer on the safe and
    > effective use of the device prior to performing LAAC; and,

-   Has performed ≥ 25 interventional cardiac procedures that involve
    > transeptal

> puncture through an intact septum; and,

-   Continues to perform ≥ 25 interventional cardiac procedures that
    > involve transeptal puncture through an intact septum, of which at
    > least 12 are LAAC, over a 2-year period.

> The patient is enrolled in, and the MDT and hospital must participate
> in, a prospective, national, audited registry that: 1) consecutively
> enrolls LAAC patients, and, 2) tracks the following annual outcomes
> for each patient for a period of at least 4 years from the time of the
> LAAC:

-   Operator-specific complications

-   Device-specific complications including device thrombosis

-   Stroke, adjudicated, by type

-   Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)

-   Systemic embolism

-   Death

-   Major bleeding, by site and severity

> The registry must be designed to permit identification and analysis of
> patient, practitioner, and facility level factors that predict patient
> risk for these outcomes. The
>
> registry must collect all data necessary to conduct analyses adjusted
> for relevant confounders, and have a written executable analysis plan
> in place to address the following questions:

-   How do the outcomes listed above compare to outcomes in the pivotal
    > clinical trials in the short term (≤12 months) and in the long

-   What is the long term (≥ 4 year) durability of the device?

-   What are the short term (≤12 months) and the long term (≥4 years)
    > device- specific complications including device thromboses?

> To appropriately address some of these questions, Medicare claims or
> other outside data may be necessary.
>

# - Supervised Exercise Therapy (SET) for Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)

## (Rev. 207, Issued: 05-11-18, Effective: 05-25-17, Implementation: 07-02-18)

A.  **General**

> Research has shown supervised exercise therapy (SET) to be an
> effective, minimally invasive method to alleviate the most common
> symptom associated with peripheral artery disease (PAD) --
> intermittent claudication (IC). SET has been shown to be significantly
> more effective than unsupervised exercise, and could prevent the
> progression of PAD and lower the risk of cardiovascular events that
> are prevalent in these patients. SET has also been shown to perform at
> least as well as more invasive revascularization treatments that are
> covered by Medicare.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective for services performed on or after May 25, 2017, the Centers
> for Medicare & Medicaid Services has determined that the evidence is
> sufficient to cover SET for beneficiaries with IC for the treatment of
> symptomatic PAD. Up to 36 sessions over a
>
> 12-week period are covered if all of the following components of a SET
> program are met. The SET program must:

> transform bodily signals indicative of such functions as heart rate,
> blood pressure, skin temperature, salivation, peripheral vasomotor
> activity, and gross muscle tone into a tone or light, the loudness or
> brightness of which shows the extent of activity in the function being

> **(Rev. 48, Issued: 03-17-06; Effective/Implementation Dates:
> 06-19-06)**
>
> **CIM 60-11**
>
> There are several different types of blood glucose monitors that use
> reflectance meters to determine blood glucose levels. Medicare
> coverage of these devices varies, with respect to both the type of
> device and the medical condition of the patient for whom the device is
> prescribed.
>
> Reflectance colorimeter devices used for measuring blood glucose
> levels in clinical settings are not covered as durable medical
> equipment for use in the home because their need for frequent
> professional re-calibration makes them unsuitable for home use.
>
> However, some types of blood glucose monitors which use a reflectance
> meter specifically designed for home use by diabetic patients may be
> covered as durable medical equipment, subject to the conditions and
> limitations described below.
>
> Blood glucose monitors are meter devices that read color changes
> produced on specially treated reagent strips by glucose concentrations
> in the patient's blood. The patient, using a disposable sterile
> lancet, draws a drop of blood, places it on a reagent strip and,
> following instructions which may vary with the device used, inserts it
> into the device to obtain a reading. Lancets, reagent strips, and
> other supplies necessary for the proper functioning of the device are
> also covered for patients for whom the device is indicated. Home blood
> glucose monitors enable certain patients to better control their blood
> glucose
>
> levels by frequently checking and appropriately contacting their
> attending physician for advice and treatment. Studies indicate that
> the patient's ability to carefully follow proper procedures is
> critical to obtaining satisfactory results with these devices. In
> addition, the cost of the devices, with their supplies, limits
> economical use to patients who must make frequent checks of their
> blood glucose levels. Accordingly, coverage of home blood glucose
> monitors is limited to patients meeting the following conditions:

1.  The patient has been diagnosed as having diabetes;

2.  The patient's physician states that the patient is capable of being
    trained to use the particular device prescribed in an appropriate
    manner. In some cases, the patient may not be able to perform this
    function, but a responsible individual can be trained to use the
    equipment and monitor the patient to assure that the intended effect
    is achieved. This is permissible if the record is properly
    documented by the patient's physician; and

3.  The device is designed for home rather than clinical use.

> There is also a blood glucose monitoring system designed especially
> for use by those with visual impairments. The monitors used in such
> systems are identical in terms of reliability and sensitivity to the
> standard blood glucose monitors described above. They differ by having
> such features as voice synthesizers, automatic timers, and specially
> designed arrangements of supplies and materials to enable the visually
> impaired to use the equipment without assistance.
>
> These special blood glucose monitoring systems are covered under
> Medicare if the following conditions are met:

-   The patient and device meet the three conditions listed above for
    coverage of standard home blood glucose monitors; and

-   The patient's physician certifies that he or she has a visual
    impairment severe enough to require use of this special monitoring
    system.

> The additional features and equipment of these special systems justify
> a higher reimbursement amount than allowed for standard blood glucose
> monitors. Separately identify claims for such devices and establish a
> separate reimbursement amount for them.

# - Closed-Loop Blood Glucose Control Device (CBGCD)

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-70**
>
> The closed-loop blood glucose control device (CBGCD) is a hospital
> bedside device designed for short-term management of patients with
> insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type I). It consists of a rapid
> on-line glucose analyzer; a computer with a controller for the
> calculation and control of the infusion of either insulin or dextrose;
> a multi-channel infusion system; and a printer designed to record
> continuous glucose values and to
>
> provide cumulative totals of the substances infused. Its primary use
> is for the stabilization of Type I diabetics during periods of stress,
> such as trauma, labor and delivery, and surgery, when there are wide
> fluctuations in blood sugar levels. It serves to temporarily correct
> abnormal blood glucose levels (hyper- or hypo-glycemia) and this
> correction is made by infusion of either insulin or dextrose. Its use
> is generally limited to a 24- to 48-hour period because of potential
> complications; (e.g., sepsis, thromboses, and nonportability, etc.).
> The CBGCD requires specialized training for use and interpretation of
> its diagnostic and therapeutic contribution and continuous observation
> by specially trained medical personnel.
>
> Use of the CBGCD is covered for short-term management of insulin
> dependent diabetics in crisis situations, in a hospital inpatient
> setting, and only under the direction of specially trained medical
> personnel.

> This regimen is also sometimes termed Cellular Activation Therapy
> (CAT), Chronic Intermittent Intravenous Insulin Therapy (CIIT),
> Hepatic Activation Therapy (HAT), Intercellular Activation Therapy
> (iCAT), Metabolic Activation Therapy (MAT), Pulsatile Intravenous
> Insulin Treatment (PIVIT), Pulse Insulin Therapy (PIT), and Pulsatile
> Therapy (PT).
>
> In OIVIT, insulin is intravenously administered in the outpatient
> setting for a variety of indications. Most commonly, it is delivered
> in pulses, but it may be delivered as a more conventional drip
> solution. The insulin administration is adjunctive to the patient's
> routine diabetic management regimen (oral agent or insulin-based) or
> other disease management regimen, typically performed on an
> intermittent basis (often weekly), and frequently performed
> chronically without duration limits. Glucose or other carbohydrate is

## (Rev. 184, Issued: 08-21-15, Effective: 07-29-15, Implementation: 09-21-15)

A.  **General**

> Speech generating devices are considered to fall within the durable
> medical equipment (DME) benefit category established by §1861(n) of
> the Social Security Act. They are covered for patients who suffer from
> a severe speech impairment and have a medical condition that warrants
> the use of a device based on the following definitions.
>
> Speech generating devices are defined as durable medical equipment
> that provides an individual who has a severe speech impairment with
> the ability to meet his or her functional, speaking needs. Speech
> generating devices are speech aids consisting of devices or software
> that generate speech and are used solely by the individual who has a
> severe speech impairment. The speech is generated using one of the
> following methods:

-   digitized audible/verbal speech output, using prerecorded messages;

-   synthesized audible/verbal speech output which requires message
    > formulation by spelling and device access by physical contact with
    > the device-direct selection techniques;

-   synthesized audible/verbal speech output which permits multiple
    > methods of message formulation and multiple methods of device
    > access; or

-   software that allows a computer or other electronic device to
    > generate audible/verbal speech.

> Other covered features of the device include the capability to
> generate email, text, or phone messages to allow the patient to
> "speak" or communicate remotely, as well as the capability to download
> updates to the covered features of the device from the manufacturer or
> supplier of the device.
>
> If a speech generating device is limited to use by a patient with a
> severe speech impairment and is primarily used for the purpose of
> generating speech, it is not necessary for the device to be dedicated
> only to audible/verbal speech output to be considered DME. Computers
> and tablets are generally not considered DME because they are useful
> in the absence of an illness or injury.

## Nationally Covered Indications

## (Rev. 11875; Issued:02-23-23; Effective: 09-26-22; Implementation: 03-24-23)

A.  General

> A cochlear implant device is an electronic instrument, part of which
> is implanted surgically to stimulate auditory nerve fibers, and part
> of which is worn or carried by the individual to capture, analyze, and
> code sound. Cochlear implant devices are available in single-channel
> and multi-channel models. The purpose of implanting the device is to
> provide awareness and identification of sounds and to facilitate
> communication for persons who are moderately to profoundly hearing
> impaired.

B.  Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective for services performed on or after September 26, 2022,
> cochlear implantation may be covered for treatment of bilateral pre-
> or post-linguistic, sensorineural, moderate- to-profound hearing loss
> in individuals who demonstrate limited benefit from amplification.
> Limited benefit from amplification is defined by test scores of less
> than or equal to 60% correct in the best-aided listening condition on
> recorded tests of open-set sentence recognition. Patients must meet
> all of the following criteria.

-   Diagnosis of bilateral moderate-to-profound sensorineural hearing
    > impairment with limited benefit from appropriate hearing (or
    > vibrotactile) aids;

-   Cognitive ability to use auditory clues and a willingness to undergo
    > an extended program of rehabilitation;

-   Freedom from middle ear infection, an accessible cochlear lumen that
    > is structurally suited to implantation, and freedom from lesions
    > in the auditory nerve and acoustic areas of the central nervous
    > system;

-   No contraindications to surgery; and

-   The device must be used in accordance with Food and Drug
    > Administration (FDA)-approved labeling.

C.  Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> Medicare beneficiaries not meeting all of the coverage criteria for
> cochlear implantation listed in Section B are deemed not eligible for
> Medicare coverage except as described in Section D below.

D.  Other

> CMS may provide coverage of cochlear implants for beneficiaries not
> meeting the coverage criteria listed in Section B when performed in

# - Ultrasonic Surgery

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-4**
>
> Reimbursement may be made for ultrasonic surgery when required in the
> treatment of patients with severe and recurrent episodes of vertigo
> due to Meniere's syndrome. This procedure utilizes a machine that
> produces ultrasonic waves of high intensity and frequency that
> selectively irradiate certain portions of the inner ear thereby

>
> **CIM 50-8.1**
>
> Presently, peripheral neuropathy, or diabetic sensory neuropathy, is
> the most common factor leading to amputation in people with diabetes.
> In diabetes, sensory neuropathy is an anatomically diffuse process
> primarily affecting sensory and autonomic fibers; however, distal
> motor findings may be present in advanced cases. Long nerves are
> affected first, with symptoms typically beginning insidiously in the
> toes and then advancing proximally. This leads to loss of protective
> sensation (LOPS), whereby a person is unable to feel minor trauma from
> mechanical, thermal, or chemical sources.
>
> When foot lesions are present, the reduction in autonomic nerve
> functions may also inhibit wound healing.
>
> Diabetic sensory neuropathy with LOPS is a localized illness of the
> feet and falls within the regulation's exception to the general
> exclusionary rule (see [[42 CFR
> 411.15(l)(1)(i)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/)).
> Foot exams for people with diabetic sensory neuropathy with LOPS are
> reasonable and necessary to allow for early intervention in serious
> complications that typically afflict diabetics with the disease.
>
> Effective for services furnished on or after July 1, 2002, Medicare
> covers, as a physician service, an evaluation (examination and
> treatment) of the feet no more often than every six months for
> individuals with a documented diagnosis of diabetic sensory neuropathy
> and LOPS, as long as the beneficiary has not seen a foot care
> specialist for some other reason in the interim. LOPS shall be
> diagnosed through sensory testing with the 5.07 monofilament using
> established guidelines, such as those developed by the National
> Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases guidelines.
> Five sites should be tested on the plantar surface of each foot,
> according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
> Kidney Diseases guidelines. The areas must be tested randomly since
> the loss of protective sensation may be patchy in distribution, and
> the patient may get clues if the test is done rhythmically. Heavily
> callused areas should be avoided. As suggested by the American
> Podiatric Medicine Association, an absence of sensation at two or more
> sites out of 5 tested on either foot when tested with the 5.07 Semmes-
> Weinstein monofilament must be present and documented to diagnose
> peripheral neuropathy with loss of protective sensation.
>
> The examination includes:

1.  A patient history, and

2.  A physical examination that must consist of at least the following
    > elements:

    -   Visual inspection of forefoot and hindfoot (including toe web
        > spaces);

    -   Evaluation of protective sensation;

    -   Evaluation of foot structure and biomechanics;

    -   Evaluation of vascular status and skin integrity;

        > education.

## A. Treatment includes, but is not limited to:

-   Local care of superficial wounds;

-   Debridement of corns and calluses; and

-   Trimming and debridement of nails.

> The diagnosis of diabetic sensory neuropathy with LOPS should be
> established and documented prior to coverage of foot care. Other
> causes of peripheral neuropathy should be considered and investigated

>
> In order to accurately apply the criteria in the Medicare Benefit
> Policy Manual, Chapters 6, §20.4.1, or Chapter 15, "Covered Medical

>
> §60.1, the auxiliary medical personnel must be members of the office

> Effective April 1, 2004, OPT with verteporfin is covered for patients
> with a diagnosis of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
> with:

-   Predominately classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
    lesions (where the area of classic CNV occupies ≥50% of the area of
    the entire lesion) at the initial visit as determined by a
    fluorescein angiogram (FA). (CNV lesions are comprised of classic
    and/or occult components.) Subsequent follow-up visits require
    either an optical coherence tomography (effective April 3, 2013) or
    an FA (effective April 1, 2004) to access treatment response.

> There are no requirements regarding visual acuity, lesion size, and
> number of retreatments when treating predominantly classic lesions.

-   Subfoveal occult with no classic CNV associated with AMD.

-   Subfoveal minimally classic CNV (where the area of classic CNV
    occupies \<50% of the area of the entire lesion) associated with
    AMD.

> The above 2 indications are considered reasonable and necessary only
> when:

1.  The lesions are small (4 disk areas or less in size) at the time of
    initial treatment or within the 3 months prior to initial treatment;
    and,

2.  The lesions have shown evidence of progression within the 3 months
    prior to initial treatment. Evidence of progression must be
    documented by deterioration of visual acuity (at least 5 letters on
    a standard eye examination chart), lesion growth

> (an increase in at least 1 disk area), or the appearance of blood
> associated with the lesion.

## Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> Other uses of OPT with verteporfin to treat AMD not already addressed
> by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will continue to be
> non-covered. These include, but are not limited to, the following AMD
> indications: juxtafoveal or extrafoveal CNV lesions (lesions outside
> the fovea), inability to obtain an FA, or atrophic or "dry" AMD.

## Other

> The OPT with verteporfin for other ocular indications, such as
> pathologic myopia or presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, continue
> to be eligible for local coverage determinations through individual
> A/B MAC discretion.

# - Hydrophilic Contact Lenses

## (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> Hydrophilic contact lenses are eyeglasses within the meaning of the
> exclusion in
>
> [[§1862(a)(7)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Social Security Act and are not covered when used in the treatment
> of non-diseased eyes with spherical ametrophia, refractive
> astigmatism, and/or corneal astigmatism. Payment may be made under the
> prosthetic device benefit, however, for hydrophilic contact lenses
> when prescribed for an aphakic patient.
>
> A/B MACs are authorized to accept a Food and Drug Administration
> (FDA**)** letter of approval or other FDA-published material as
> evidence of FDA approval. (See [§80.1]{.underline} for coverage of a
> hydrophilic lens as a corneal bandage.)

# - Scleral Shell

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 65.3**
>
> Scleral shell (or shield) is a catchall term for different types of
> hard scleral contact lenses. A scleral shell fits over the entire
> exposed surface of the eye as opposed to a corneal contact lens which
> covers only the central non-white area encompassing the pupil and
> iris. Where an eye has been rendered sightless and shrunken by
> inflammatory disease, a
>
> scleral shell may, among other things, obviate the need for surgical
> enucleation and prosthetic implant and act to support the surrounding
> orbital tissue. In such a case, the device serves essentially as an
> artificial eye. In this situation, payment may be made for a scleral
> shell under
> [[§1861(s)(8)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Act.
>
> Scleral shells are occasionally used in combination with artificial
> tears in the treatment of "dry eye" of diverse etiology. Tears
> ordinarily dry at a rapid rate, and are continually replaced by the
> lacrimal gland. When the lacrimal gland fails, the half-life of
> artificial tears may be greatly prolonged by the use of the scleral
> contact lens as a protective barrier against the drying action of the
> atmosphere. Thus, the difficult and sometimes hazardous process of
> frequent installation of artificial tears may be avoided. The lens
> acts in this instance to substitute, in part, for the functioning of
> the diseased lacrimal gland and would be covered as a prosthetic
> device in the rare case when it is used in the treatment of "dry eye."

> §120.1.

# - Intraocular Photography

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-39**
>
> Intraocular photography is covered when used for the diagnosis of such
> conditions as macular degeneration, retinal neoplasms, choroid
> disturbances and diabetic retinopathy, or to identify glaucoma,
> multiple sclerosis and other central nervous system abnormalities.
> Make Medicare payment for the use of this procedure by an
> opthalmologist in these situations when it is reasonable and necessary
> for the individual patient to receive these services.

# - Refractive Keratoplasty

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-54**

## Not Covered

> Refractive keratoplasty is surgery to reshape the cornea of the eye to
> correct vision problems such as myopia (nearsightedness) and hyperopia
> (farsightedness). Refractive keratoplasty procedures include
> keratomileusis, in which the front of the cornea is removed, frozen,
> reshaped, and stitched back on the eye to correct either near or
> farsightedness; keratophakia, in which a reshaped donor cornea is
> inserted in the eye to correct farsightedness; and radial keratotomy,
> in which spoke-like slits are cut in the
>
> cornea to weaken and flatten the normally curved central portion to
> correct nearsightedness.
>
> The correction of common refractive errors by eyeglasses, contact
> lenses or other prosthetic devices is specifically excluded from
> coverage. The use of radial keratotomy and/or keratoplasty for the
> purpose of refractive error compensation is considered a substitute or
> alternative to eye glasses or contact lenses which are specifically
> excluded by [[§1862
> (a)(7)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of the Act
> (except in certain cases in connection with cataract surgery). In
> addition, many in the medical community consider such procedures
> cosmetic surgery which is excluded by §§1862 (a)(10) of the Act.
> Therefore, radial keratotomy and keratoplasty to treat refractive
> defects are not covered.

# - Keratoplasty

## (Rev. 1, 10-03-03)

> Keratoplasty that treats specific lesions of the cornea, such as
> phototherapeutic keratectomy that removes scar tissue from the visual
> field, deals with an abnormality of the eye and is not cosmetic
> surgery. Such cases may be covered under
> [[§1862(a)(1)(A)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Act.
>
> The use of lasers to treat ophthalmic disease constitutes
> opthalmalogic surgery. Coverage is restricted to practitioners who
> have completed an approved training program in ophthalmologic surgery.

# - Endothelial Cell Photography

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 50-38**
>
> Endothelial cell photography involves the use of a specular microscope
> to determine the endothelial cell count. It is used by
> ophthalmologists as a predictor of success of ocular surgery or
> certain other ocular procedures. Endothelial cell photography is a
> covered procedure under Medicare when reasonable and necessary for
> patients who meet one or more of the following criteria:

-   Have slit lamp evidence of endothelial dystrophy (cornea guttata),

-   Have slit lamp evidence of corneal edema (unilateral or bilateral),

-   Are about to undergo a secondary intraocular lens implantation,

-   Have had previous intraocular surgery and require cataract surgery,

-   Are about to undergo a surgical procedure associated with a higher
    > risk to corneal endothelium; i.e., phacoemulsification, or
    > refractive surgery (see [§80.7]{.underline} for excluded
    > refractive procedures),

-   With evidence of posterior polymorphous dystrophy of the cornea or
    > irido- corneal-endothelium syndrome, or

-   Are about to be fitted with extended wear contact lenses after
    > intraocular surgery.

> When a presurgical examination for cataract surgery is performed and
> the conditions of
>
> this section are met, if the only visual problem is cataracts,
> endothelial cell photography is covered as part of the presurgical
> comprehensive eye examination or combination brief/intermediate
> examination provided prior to cataract surgery, and not in addition to
> it. (See [§10.1]{.underline})

# - Computer Enhanced Perimetry

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 50-49**
>
> Computer enhanced perimetry involves the use of a micro-computer to
> measure visual sensitivity at preselected locations in the visual
> field. It is a covered service when used in assessing visual fields in
> patients with glaucoma or other neuropathologic defects.

# - Phaco-Emulsification Procedure - Cataract Extraction

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-9**
>
> In view of recommendations of authoritative sources in the field of
> ophthalmology, the subject technique is viewed as an accepted
> procedure for removal of cataracts.
>
> Accordingly, program reimbursement may be made for necessary services
> furnished in connection with cataract extraction utilizing the
> phaco-emulsification procedure.

# - Vitrectomy

> **(Rev. 48, Issued: 03-17-06; Effective/Implementation Dates:
> 06-19-06)**
>
> **CIM - 35-16**
>
> Vitrectomy may be considered reasonable and necessary for the
> following conditions: vitreous loss incident to cataract surgery,
> vitreous opacities due to vitreous hemorrhage or other causes, retinal
> detachments secondary to vitreous strands, proliferative retinopathy,
> and vitreous retraction. See chapter 23 of the Medicare Claims
> Processing Manual for how to determine payment for physician
> vitrectomy services and the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter
> 14, "Ambulatory Surgical Centers," §40, for how to determine payment
> for ASC facility vitrectomy services. Also, see the Medicare Claims
> Processing Manual, Chapter 23, "Fee Schedule Administration and Coding
> Requirements," §20.9, to identify when, for Medicare payment purposes,
> certain vitrectomy codes are included in other codes or when codes for
> other services include vitrectomy codes.

# - Intraocular Lenses (IOLs)

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 65-7**
>
> An intraocular lens, or pseudophakos, is an artificial lens which may
> be implanted to replace the natural lens after cataract surgery.
> Intraocular lens implantation services, as well as the lens itself,
> may be covered if reasonable and necessary for the individual.
>
> Implantation services may include hospital, surgical, and other
> medical services,
>
> including preimplantation ultrasound (A-scan) eye measurement of one
> or both eyes. Cross-reference:
>
> The Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 6,"Hospital Services
> Covered Under Part B," §10.
>
> The Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, "Covered Medical and
> Other Health Services," §120.
