# - Pharmacogenomic Testing to Predict Warfarin Responsiveness (Effective August 3, 2009)

### (Rev. 111, Issued: 12-18-09, Effective: 08-03-09, Implementation: 04-05-10)

A.  **General**

> Warfarin sodium is an orally administered anticoagulant drug that is
> marketed most commonly as Coumadin®. (The Food and Drug Administration
> (FDA) approved labeling for Coumadin® includes a Black Box Warning
> dating back to 2007.) Anticoagulant drugs are sometimes referred to as
> blood thinners by the lay public. Warfarin affects the vitamin
> K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Warfarin is thought
> to interfere with clotting factor synthesis by inhibition of the C1
> subunit of the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) enzyme complex,
> thereby reducing the regeneration of vitamin K1 epoxide. The
> elimination of warfarin is almost entirely by metabolic conversion to
> inactive metabolites by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in liver cells.
> CYP2C9 is the principal cytochrome P450 enzyme that modulates the
> anticoagulant activity of warfarin. From results of clinical studies,
> genetic variation in the CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genes can, in concert
> with clinical factors, predict how each individual responds to
> warfarin.
>
> Pharmacogenomics denotes the study of how an individual\'s genetic
> makeup, or genotype, affects the body\'s response to drugs.
> Pharmacogenomics as a science examines associations among variations
> in genes with individual responses to a drug or medication. In
> application, pharmacogenomic results (i.e., information on the
> patient's genetic variations) can contribute to predicting a patient's
> response to a given drug: good, bad, or none at all. Pharmacogenomic
> testing of CYP2C9 or VKORC1 alleles to predict a patient's response to
> warfarin occurs ideally prior to initiation of the drug. This would be
> an once-in-a-lifetime test, absent any reason to believe that the
> patient's personal genetic characteristics would change over time.
> Although such pharmacogenomic testing would be used to attempt to
> better approximate the best starting dose of warfarin, it would not
> eliminate the need for periodic PT/INR testing, a standard diagnostic
> test for coagulation activity and for assessing how a patient is
> reacting to a warfarin dose.

### Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective August 3, 2009, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
> (CMS) believes that the available evidence supports that coverage with
> evidence development (CED) under §1862(a)(1)(E) of the Social Security
> Act (the Act) is appropriate for pharmacogenomic testing of CYP2C9 or
> VKORC1 alleles to predict warfarin responsiveness by any method, and
> is therefore covered only when provided to Medicare beneficiaries who
> are candidates for anticoagulation therapy with warfarin who:

1.  Have not been previously tested for CYP2C9 or VKORC1 alleles; and

2.  Have received fewer than five days of warfarin in the
    anticoagulation regimen for which the testing is ordered; and

3.  Are enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study
    when that study meets the following standards.

> A clinical study seeking Medicare payment for pharmacogenomic testing
> of CYP2C9 or VKORC1 alleles to predict warfarin responsiveness
> provided to the Medicare beneficiary who is a candidate for
> anticoagulation therapy with warfarin pursuant to CED must address one
> or more aspects of the following question:
>
> Prospectively, in Medicare-aged subjects whose warfarin therapy
> management includes pharmacogenomic testing of CYP2C9 or VKORC1
> alleles to predict warfarin response, what is the frequency and
> severity of the following outcomes, compared to subjects whose
> warfarin therapy management does not include pharmacogenomic testing?

-   Major hemorrhage

-   Minor hemorrhage

-   Thromboembolism related to the primary indication for
    > anticoagulation

-   Other thromboembolic event

-   Mortality

> The study must adhere to the following standards of scientific
> integrity and relevance to the Medicare population:

a.  The principal purpose of the research study is to test whether a
    particular intervention potentially improves the participants'
    health outcomes.

b.  The research study is well-supported by available scientific and
    medical information or it is intended to clarify or establish the
    health outcomes of interventions already in common clinical use.

c.  The research study does not unjustifiably duplicate existing
    > studies.

d.  The research study design is appropriate to answer the research
    > question being asked in the study.

e.  The research study is sponsored by an organization or individual
    capable of executing the proposed study successfully.

f.  The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal
    regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found in the
    Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 45 CFR Part 46. If a study is
    regulated by the FDA, it also must be in compliance with 21 CFR
    Parts 50 and 56.

g.  All aspects of the research study are conducted according to the
    appropriate standards of scientific integrity.

h.  The research study has a written protocol that clearly addresses, or
    incorporates by reference, the Medicare standards.

i.  The clinical research study is not designed to exclusively test
    toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Trials
    of all medical technologies measuring therapeutic outcomes as one of
    the objectives meet this standard only if the disease or condition
    being studied is life-threatening as defined in 21 CFR § 312.81(a)
    and the patient has no other viable treatment options.

j.  The clinical research study is registered on the
    [[www.ClinicalTrials.gov]{.underline}](http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov/)
    website by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the
    enrollment of the first study subject.

k.  The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of
    public release of all pre-specified outcomes to be measured
    including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is
    terminated early. The results must be made public within 24 months
    of the end of data collection. If a report is planned to be
    published in a peer-reviewed journal, then that initial release may
    be an abstract that meets the requirements of the International
    Committee of Medical Journal Editors. However, a full report of the
    outcomes must be made public no later than 3 years after the end of
    data collection.

l.  The research study protocol must explicitly discuss subpopulations
    affected by the treatment under investigation, particularly
    traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the
    inclusion and exclusion criteria affect enrollment of these
    populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said

> populations on the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are
> expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or retention of
> underrepresented populations, the protocol must discuss why these
> criteria are necessary.

m.  The research study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are
    or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population
    to infer whether Medicare patients may benefit from the
    intervention. Separate discussions in the protocol may be necessary
    for populations eligible for Medicare due to age, disability or
    Medicaid eligibility.

> Consistent with section 1142 of the Act, the Agency for Healthcare
> Research and Quality (AHRQ) supports clinical research studies that
> CMS determines meet the above-listed standards and address the
> above-listed research questions.

### Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> The CMS believes that the available evidence does not demonstrate that
> pharmacogenomic testing of CYP2C9 or VKORC1 alleles to predict
> warfarin responsiveness improves health outcomes in Medicare
> beneficiaries outside the context of CED, and is therefore not
> reasonable and necessary under
>
> §1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act.

### Other

> This NCD does not determine coverage to identify CYP2C9 or VKORC1
> alleles for other purposes, nor does it determine national coverage to
> identify other alleles to predict warfarin responsiveness.

# Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) for Patients with Somatic (Acquired) and Germline (Inherited) Cancer

### (Rev. 10346, Issued: 09-11-20, Effective: 01-27-20, Implementation: 11-13-20)

A.  **General**

> Clinical laboratory diagnostic tests can include tests that, for

A.  **General**

> Obesity may be caused by medical conditions such as hypothyroidism,
> Cushing\'s disease, and hypothalamic lesions, or can aggravate a
> number of cardiac and respiratory diseases as well as diabetes and
> hypertension. Non-surgical services in connection with the treatment
> of obesity are covered when such services are an integral and
> necessary part of a course of treatment for one of these medical
> conditions.
>
> In addition, supplemented fasting is a type of very low calorie weight
> reduction regimen used to achieve rapid weight loss. The reduced
> calorie intake is supplemented by a mixture of protein, carbohydrates,
> vitamins, and minerals. Serious questions exist about the safety of
> prolonged adherence for 2 months or more to a very low calorie weight
> reduction regimen as a general treatment for obesity, because of
> instances of cardiopathology and sudden death, as well as possible
> loss of body protein.
>
> Bariatric surgery procedures are performed to treat comorbid
> conditions associated with morbid obesity. Two types of surgical
> procedures are employed. Malabsorptive procedures divert food from the
> stomach to a lower part of the digestive tract where the normal mixing
> of digestive fluids and absorption of nutrients cannot occur.
> Restrictive procedures restrict the size of the stomach and decrease
> intake. Surgery can combine both types of procedures.
>
> The following are descriptions of bariatric surgery procedures:

1.  Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGBP)

> The RYGBP achieves weight loss by gastric restriction and
> malabsorption. Reduction of the stomach to a small gastric pouch (30
> cc) results in feelings of satiety following even small meals. This
> small pouch is connected to a segment of the jejunum, bypassing the
> duodenum and very proximal small intestine, thereby reducing
> absorption. RYGBP procedures can be open or laparoscopic.

2.  Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD/DS) or Gastric
    Reduction Duodenal Switch (BPD/GRDS)

> The BPD achieves weight loss by gastric restriction and malabsorption.
> The stomach is partially resected, but the remaining capacity is
> generous compared to that achieved with RYGBP. As such, patients eat
> relatively normal-sized meals and do not need to restrict intake
> radically, since the most proximal areas of the small intestine (i.e.,
> the duodenum and jejunum) are bypassed, and substantial malabsorption
> occurs. The partial BPD/DS or BPD/GRDS is a variant of the BPD
> procedure. It involves resection of the greater curvature of the
> stomach, preservation of the pyloric sphincter, and transection of the
> duodenum above the ampulla of Vater with a duodeno-ileal anastomosis
> and a lower ileo-ileal anastomosis. BPD/DS or BPD/GRDS procedures can
> be open or laparoscopic.

3.  Adjustable Gastric Banding (AGB)

> The AGB achieves weight loss by gastric restriction only. A band
> creating a gastric pouch with a capacity of approximately 15 to 30
> cc's encircles the uppermost portion of the stomach. The band is an
> inflatable doughnut-shaped balloon, the diameter of which can be
> adjusted in the clinic by adding or removing saline via a port that is
> positioned beneath the skin. The bands are adjustable, allowing the
> size of the gastric outlet to be modified as needed, depending on the
> rate of a patient's weight loss. AGB procedures are laparoscopic only.

4.  Sleeve Gastrectomy

> Sleeve gastrectomy is a 70%-80% greater curvature gastrectomy (sleeve
> resection of the stomach) with continuity of the gastric lesser curve
> being maintained while simultaneously reducing stomach volume. In the
> past, sleeve gastrectomy was the first step in a two-stage procedure
> when performing RYGBP, but more recently has been offered as a
> stand-alone surgery. Sleeve gastrectomy procedures can be open or
> laparoscopic.

5.  Vertical Gastric Banding (VGB)

> The VGB achieves weight loss by gastric restriction only. The upper
> part of the stomach is stapled, creating a narrow gastric inlet or
> pouch that remains connected with the remainder of the stomach. In
> addition, a non- adjustable band is placed around this new inlet in an
> attempt to prevent future enlargement of the stoma (opening). As a
> result, patients experience a sense of fullness after eating small
> meals. Weight loss from this procedure results entirely from eating
> less. VGB procedures are essentially no longer performed.

# - Extracorporeal Photopheresis

### (Rev. 143, Issued: 05-18-12, Effective: 04-30-12, Implementation: 10-01-12)

A.  **General**

> Extracorporeal photopheresis is a medical procedure in which a
> patient's white blood cells are exposed first to a drug called
> 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and then to ultraviolet A (UVA) light. The
> procedure starts with the removal of the patient's blood, which is
> centrifuged to isolate the white blood cells. The drug is typically
> administered directly to the white blood cells after they have been
> removed from the patient (referred to as ex vivo administration) but
> the drug can alternatively be administered directly to the patient
> before the white blood cells are withdrawn. After UVA light exposure,
> the treated white blood cells are then re-infused into the patient.

### Nationally Covered Indications

1.  Effective April 8, 1988, Medicare provides coverage for:

> Palliative treatment of skin manifestations of cutaneous T-cell
> lymphoma that has not responded to other therapy.

2.  Effective December 19, 2006, Medicare also provides coverage for:

> Patients with acute cardiac allograft rejection whose disease is
> refractory to standard immunosuppressive drug treatment; and,
>
> Patients with chronic graft versus host disease whose disease is
> refractory to standard immunosuppressive drug treatment.

3.  Effective April 30, 2012, Medicare also provides coverage for:

> Extracorporeal photopheresis for the treatment of bronchiolitis
> obliterans syndrome (BOS) following lung allograft transplantation
> only when extracorporeal photopheresis is provided under a clinical
> research study that meets the following conditions:
>
> The clinical research study meets the requirements specified below to

h.  The research study has a written protocol that clearly addresses, or
    > incorporates by reference, the standards listed here as Medicare
    > requirements for coverage with evidence development.

i.  The clinical research study is not designed to exclusively test
    > toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Trials
    > of all medical technologies measuring therapeutic outcomes as one
    > of the objectives meet this standard only if the disease or
    > condition being studied is life threatening as defined in 21 CFR §

> Keeping the scalp cool during chemotherapy has been noted to reduce
> the risk of hair loss. The cooling may be done by packing the scalp
> with ice-filled bags or bandages, or by specially designed devices
> filled with cold-producing chemicals activated during chemotherapy.
>
> While ice-filled bags or bandages or other devices used for scalp
> hypothermia during chemotherapy may be covered as supplies of the kind

# - Blood Transfusions

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 45-27**
>
> Blood transfusions are used to restore blood volume after hemorrhage,
> to improve the oxygen carrying capacity of blood in severe anemia, and
> to combat shock in acute hemolytic anemia.

A.  ### Definitions

    1.  Homologous Blood Transfusion

> Homologous blood transfusion is the infusion of blood or blood
> components that have been collected from the general public.

2.  Autologous Blood Transfusion

> An autologous blood transfusion is the precollection and subsequent
> infusion of a patient's own blood.

3.  Donor Directed Blood Transfusion

> A donor directed blood transfusion is the infusion of blood or blood
> components that have been precollected from a specific individual(s)
> other than the patient and subsequently infused into the specific
> patient for whom the blood is designated. For example, patient B's
> brother predeposits his blood for use by patient B during upcoming
> surgery.

4.  Perioperative Blood Salvage

> Perioperative blood salvage is the collection and reinfusion of blood
> lost during and immediately after surgery.

### Policy Governing Transfusions

> For Medicare coverage purposes, it is important to distinguish between
> a transfusion itself and preoperative blood services; e.g.,
> collection, processing, storage. Medically necessary transfusion of
> blood, regardless of the type, may generally be a covered service
> under both Part A and Part B of Medicare. Coverage does not make a
> distinction between the transfusion of homologous, autologous, or
> donor-directed blood. With respect to the coverage of the services
> associated with the preoperative collection, processing, and storage
> of autologous and donor-directed blood, the following policies apply.

1.  Hospital Part A and B Coverage and Payment

> Under
> [[§1862(a)(14)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Act, nonphysician services furnished to hospital patients are
> covered and paid for as hospital services. As provided in
> [[§1886]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of the Act,
> under the prospective payment system (PPS), the diagnosis related
> group (DRG) payment to the hospital includes all covered blood and
> blood processing expenses, whether or not the blood is eventually
> used.
>
> In a situation where the hospital operates its own blood collection
> activities, rather than using an independent blood supplier, the costs
> incurred to collect autologous or donor-directed blood are recorded in
> the whole blood and packed red blood cells cost center. Because the
> blood has been replaced, Medicare does not recognize a charge for the
> blood itself. Under PPS, the DRG payment is intended to pay for all
> covered blood and blood services, whether or not the blood is
> eventually used.
>
> Under its provider agreement, a hospital is required to furnish or
> arrange for all covered services furnished to hospital patients.
> Medicare payment is made to the hospital, under PPS or cost
> reimbursement, for covered inpatient and outpatient services, and it
> is intended to reflect payment for all costs of furnishing those
> services.

### Nonhospital Part B Coverage

> Under Part B, to be eligible for separate coverage, a service must fit
> the definition of one of the services authorized by
> [[§1832]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of the Act.
> These services are defined in [[42 CFR
> 410.10]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) and do not
> include a separate category for a supplier's services associated with
> blood donation services, either autologous or donor- directed. That
> is, the collection, processing, and storage of blood for later
> transfusion into the beneficiary is not recognized as a separate
> service under Part B. Therefore, there is no avenue through which a
> blood supplier can receive direct payment under Part B for blood
> donation services.

### Perioperative Blood Salvage

> When the perioperative blood salvage process is used in surgery on a
> hospital patient, payment made to the hospital (under PPS or through
> cost reimbursement) for the procedure in which that process is used is
> intended to encompass payment for all costs relating to that process.

# - Blood Platelet Transfusions

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-30**
>
> Blood platelet transplants are safe and effective for the correction
> of thrombocytopenia and other blood defects. It is covered under
> Medicare when treatment is reasonable and necessary for the individual
> patient.

>
> **CIM 45-28**
>
> For antigens provided to patients on or after November 17, 1996,
> Medicare does not cover such antigens if they are to be administered
> sublingually, i.e., by placing drops under the patient's tongue. This
> kind of allergy therapy has not been proven to be safe and effective.

>
> **CIM 50-2**

### Not Covered

> Prior to August 5, 1985, Medicare covered cytotoxic food tests as an

# - Apheresis (Therapeutic Pheresis)

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-60**

### General

> Apheresis (also known as pheresis or therapeutic pheresis) is a
> medical procedure utilizing specialized equipment to remove selected
> blood constituents (plasma, leukocytes, plataelets, or cells) from
> whole blood. The remainder is retransfused into the person from whom
> the blood was taken.
>
> For purposes of Medicare coverage, apheresis is defined as an
> autologous procedure, i.e., blood is taken from the patient,
> processed, and returned to the patient as part of a continuous
> procedure (as distinguished from the procedure in which a patient
> donates blood preoperatively and is transfused with the donated blood
> at a later date).

### Indications

> Apheresis is covered for the following indications:

-   Plasma exchange for acquired myasthenia gravis;

-   Leukaphersis in the treatment of leukemia;

-   Plasmapheresis in the treatment of primary macroglobulinemia
    > (Waldenstrom);

-   Treatment of hyperglobulinemias, including (but not limited to)
    multiple myelomas, cryoglobulinemia and hyperviscosity syndromes;

-   Plasmapheresis or plasma exchange as a last resort treatment of
    thromobotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP);

-   Plasmapheresis or plasma exchange in the last resort treatment of
    life threatening rheumatoid vasculitis;

-   Plasma perfusion of charcoal filters for treatment of pruritis of
    > cholestatic liver disease;

-   Plasma exchange in the treatment of Goodpasture's Syndrome;

-   Plasma exchange in the treatment of glomerulonephritis associated
    with antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies and advancing renal
    failure or pulmonary hemorrhage;

-   Treatment of chronic relapsing polyneuropathy for patients with
    severe or life threatening symptoms who have failed to respond to
    conventional therapy;

-   Treatment of life threatening scleroderma and polymyositis when the
    patient is unresponsive to conventional therapy;

-   Treatment of Guillain-Barre Syndrome; and

-   Treatment of last resort for life threatening systemic lupus
    erythematosus (SLE) when conventional therapy has failed to prevent
    clinical deterioration.

### Settings

> Apheresis is covered only when performed in a hospital setting (either
> inpatient or outpatient); or in a nonhospital setting, e.g., a
> physician directed clinic when the following conditions are met:

-   A physician (or a number of physicians) is present to perform
    medical services and to respond to medical emergencies at all times
    during patient care hours;

-   Each patient is under the care of a physician; and

-   All nonphysician services are furnished under the direct, personal
    > supervision of a physician.

# - Ultrafiltration, Hemoperfusion and Hemofiltration

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-38**

### Ultrafiltration

> This is a process for removing excess fluid from the blood through the
> dialysis membrane by means of pressure. It is not a substitute for
> dialysis. Ultrafiltration is utilized in cases where excess fluid
> cannot be removed easily during the regular course of hemodialysis.
> When it is performed, it is commonly done during the first hour or two
> of each hemodialysis on patients who, e.g., have refractory edema.
>
> Ultrafiltration is a covered procedure under the Medicare program
> (effective for services performed on and after September 1, 1979)
>
> Predialysis Ultrafiltration
>
> While this procedure requires additional staff care, the facility
> dialysis rate is intended to cover the full range of complicated and
> uncomplicated nonacute dialysis treatments. Therefore, no additional
> facility charge is recognized for predialysis ultrafiltration. The
> physician's role in ultrafiltration varies with the stability of the
> patient's condition. In unstable patients, the physician may need to
> be present at the initiation of dialysis, and available either
> in-house or in close proximity to monitor the patient carefully. In
> patients who are relatively stable, but who seem to accumulate
> excessive weight gain, the procedure requires only a modest increase
> in physician involvement over routine outpatient hemodialysis.
>
> Occasionally, medical complications may occur which require that
> ultrafiltration be performed separate from the dialysis treatment, and
> in these cases an additional charge can be recognized. However, the
> claim must be documented as to why the ultrafiltration could not have
> been performed at the same time as the dialysis.

### Hemoperfusion

> This is a process which removes substances from the blood using a
> charcoal or resin artificial kidney. When used in the treatment of
> life threatening drug overdose, hemoperfusion is a covered service for
> patients with or without renal failure. Hemoperfusion generally
> requires a physician to be present to initiate treatment and to be
> present in the hospital or an adjacent medical office during the
> entire procedure, as changes may be sudden. Special staff training and
> equipment are required.
>
> Develop charges for hemoperfusion in the same manner as for any new or
> unusual service. One or two treatments are usually all that is
> necessary to remove the toxic compound; document additional
> treatments. Hemoperfusion may be performed concurrently with dialysis,
> and in those cases payment for the hemoperfusion reflects only the
> additional care rendered over and above the care given with dialysis.
>
> The effects of using hemoperfusion to improve the results of chronic
> hemodialysis are not known. Therefore, hemoperfusion is not a covered
> service when used to improve the results of hemodialysis. In addition,
> it has not been demonstrated that the use of hemoperfusion in
> conjunction with deferoxamine (DFO), in treating symptomatic patients
> with iron overload, is efficacious. There is also a paucity of data
> regarding its efficacy in treating asymptomatic patients with iron
> overload. Therefore, hemoperfusion used in conjunction with DFO in
> treating patients with iron overload is not a covered service; i.e.,
> it is not considered reasonable and necessary within the meaning of
> [[§1862(a)(1)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Act.
>
> However, the use of hemoperfusion in conjunction with DFO for the
> treatment of patients with aluminum toxicity has been demonstrated to
> be clinically efficacious and is therefore regarded as a covered
> service.

### Hemofiltration

> This is a process which removes fluid, electrolytes and other low
> molecular weight toxic substances from the blood by filtration through
> hollow artificial membranes and may be routinely performed in 3 weekly
> sessions. Hemofiltration (which is also known as diafiltration) is a
> covered procedure under Medicare and is a safe and effective technique
> for the treatment of ESRD patients and an alternative to peritoneal
> dialysis and hemodialysis. In contrast to both hemodialysis and
> peritoneal dialysis treatments which eliminate dissolved substances
> via diffusion across semipermeable membranes, hemofiltration mimics
> the filtration process of the normal kidney. The technique requires an
> arteriovenous access. Hemofiltration may be performed either in
> facility or at home.
>
> The procedure is most advantageous when applied to high-risk unstable
> patients, such as older patients with cardiovascular diseases or
> diabetes, because there are fewer side effects such as hypotension,
> hypertension or volume overload.

# - Nonselective (Random) Transfusions and Living Related Donor Specific Transfusions (DST) in Kidney Transplantation

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-71**
>
> Transplant surgeons have established a definite correlation in both
> cadaver and living-related kidney transplantation between
> pretransplant transfusions of blood into the recipient and the success
> of graft retention.
>
> These pretransplant transfusions are covered under Medicare without a
> specific limitation on the number of transfusions, subject to the
> normal Medicare blood deductible provisions. Where blood is given
> directly to the transplant patient; e.g., in the case of donor
> specific transfusions, the blood is considered replaced for purposes
> of the blood deductible provisions. (See the Medicare General
> Information, Eligibility, and Entitlement Manual, Chapter 3,

# - Aprepitant for Chemotherapy-Induced Emesis

### General

> Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) can range from mild to
> severe, with the most severe cases resulting in dehydration,
> malnutrition, metabolic imbalances, and potential withdrawal from
> future chemotherapy treatments. The incidence and severity of CINV are
> influenced by the specific chemotherapeutic agent(s) used; dosage,
> schedule and route of administration; and drug combinations.
>
> Patient specific risk factors such as gender, age, history of motion
> sickness, and prior \`exposure to chemotherapeutic agents can also
> have an effect on CINV incidence and severity. Progress has been made
> in reducing CINV, although it can still be hard to control symptoms
> that occur more than a day after chemotherapy, during repeat cycles of
> chemotherapy, and when chemotherapy is given on more than one day or
> in very high doses. No single antiemetic agent is completely effective
> in all patients. As noted above, many factors influence the incidence
> and severity of CINV, with the specific chemotherapeutic agent as the
> primary factor to consider when deciding which antiemetic to
> administer. Aprepitant (Emend®) is the first Food and Drug
> Administration-approved drug of its type. Aprepitant has been proposed
> to function in combination with other oral antiemetics for a specified
> population of Medicare patients receiving highly emetogenic
> chemotherapy and/or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.
>
> CMS is defining highly emetogenic chemotherapy and moderately
> emetogenic chemotherapy as those anticancer agents so designated in at
> least two of three guidelines published by the National Comprehensive
> Cancer Network (NCCN), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO),

### (Rev. 67, Issued: 04-06-07; Effective Date: 03-20-07; Implementation Date: 05-07-07)

A.  **General**

> The blood brain barrier (BBB) of the central nervous system is

>
> The BBBD is the disruption of the tight junctions between the
> endothelial cells that line the capillaries in the brain accomplished
> by osmotic disruption, bradykinin or irradiation. Theoretically,
> disruption of the BBB may, in the treatment of brain tumors, increase
> the concentration of chemotherapy drugs delivered to the tumor and may

### Nationally Covered Indications

> ESA treatment for the anemia secondary to myelosuppressive anticancer
> chemotherapy in solid tumors, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and
> lymphocytic leukemia is only reasonable and necessary under the
> following specified conditions:

-   The hemoglobin level immediately prior to initiation or maintenance
    of ESA treatment is \<10 g/dL (or the hematocrit is \<30%).

-   The starting dose for ESA treatment is the recommended FDA label
    starting dose, no more than 150 U/kg/3 times weekly for epoetin and
    2.25 mcg/kg/1 time weekly for darbepoetin alpha. Equivalent doses
    may be given over other approved time periods.

-   Maintenance of ESA therapy is the starting dose if the hemoglobin
    level remains below 10g/dL (or hematocrit is \<30%) 4 weeks after
    initiation of therapy and the rise in hemoglobin is
    [\>]{.underline}1g/dL (hematocrit

> [\>]{.underline}3%);

-   For patients whose hemoglobin rises \<1g/dl (hematocrit rise \<3%)
    compared to pretreatment baseline over 4 weeks of treatment and
    whose hemoglobin level remains \<10g/dL after the 4 weeks of
    treatment (or the hematocrit is \<30%), the recommended FDA label
    starting dose may be increased once by 25%. Continued use of the
    drug is not reasonable and necessary if the hemoglobin rises \<1g/dl
    (hematocrit rise

> \<3%) compared to pretreatment baseline by 8 weeks of treatment.

-   Continued administration of the drug is not reasonable and necessary
    if there is a rapid rise in hemoglobin \>1g/dl (hematocrit \>3%)
    over 2 weeks of treatment unless the hemoglobin remains below or
    subsequently falls to \<10g/dL (or the hematocrit is \<30%).
    Continuation and reinstitution of ESA therapy must include a dose
    reduction of 25% from the previously administered dose.

-   ESA treatment duration for each course of chemotherapy includes the
    8 weeks following the final dose of myelosuppressive chemotherapy in
    a chemotherapy regimen.

### Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> ESA treatment is not reasonable and necessary for beneficiaries with
> certain clinical conditions, either because of a deleterious effect of
> the ESA on their underlying disease or because the underlying disease
> increases their risk of adverse effects related to ESA use. These
> conditions include:

-   Any anemia in cancer or cancer treatment patients due to folate
    deficiency, B-12 deficiency, iron deficiency, hemolysis, bleeding,
    or bone marrow fibrosis;

-   The anemia associated with the treatment of acute and chronic
    > myelogenous leukemias (CML, AML), or erythroid cancers;

-   The anemia of cancer not related to cancer treatment;

-   Any anemia associated only with radiotherapy;

-   Prophylactic use to prevent chemotherapy-induced anemia;

-   Prophylactic use to reduce tumor hypoxia;

-   Patients with erythropoietin-type resistance due to neutralizing
    > antibodies; and

-   Anemia due to cancer treatment if patients have uncontrolled
    > hypertension.

> cancer were diagnosed and an estimated 27,360 deaths were reported.
> The National Cancer Institute states that prostate cancer is

> cancer the median survival is generally less than two years.
>
> In 2010 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sipuleucel-T
> (PROVENGE®; APC8015), for patients with castration-resistant,
> metastatic prostate cancer. The posited mechanism of action,

> The goal of immunotherapy is to stimulate the body\'s natural defenses
> (such as the white blood cells called dendritic cells, T-lymphocytes
> and mononuclear cells) in a specific manner so that they attack and
> destroy, or at least prevent, the proliferation of cancer cells.
> Specificity is attained by intentionally exposing a patient\'s white

> is
>
> expected to result in a decrease in the size and/or number of cancer
> sites, an increase in the time to cancer progression, and/or an
> increase in survival of the patient.
>
> Sipuleucel-T differs from other infused anti-cancer therapies. Most
> such anti-cancer therapies are manufactured and sold by a
> biopharmaceutical company and then purchased by and dispensed from a
> pharmacy. In contrast, once the decision is made to treat with
> sipuleucel-T, a multi-step process is used to produce sipuleucel-T.
> Sipuleucel-T is made individually for each patient with his own white
> blood cells. The patient's white blood cells are removed via a
> procedure called leukapheresis. In a laboratory the white blood cells
> are exposed to PA2024, which is a molecule created by linking
> prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) with granulocyte/macrophage-colony
> stimulating factor (GM-CSF). PAP is an antigen specifically associated
> with prostate cancer cells; GM-CSF is a protein that targets a
> receptor on the surface of white blood cells. Hence, PAP serves to
> externally manipulate the immunological functioning of the patient\'s
> white blood cells while GM-CSF serves to stimulate the white blood
> cells into action. As noted in the FDA\'s clinical review, each dose
> of sipuleucel-T contains a minimum of 40 million treated white blood
> cells, however there is \"high inherent variability\" in the yield of
> sipuleucel-T from leukapheresis to leukapheresis in the same patient
> as well as from patient to patient. The treated white blood cells are

B.  ### Nationally Covered Indications

    I.  **Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)**

        a.  Effective for services performed on or after August 1, 1978,
            > for the treatment of leukemia, leukemia in remission, or
            > aplastic anemia when it is reasonable and necessary,

        b.  Effective for services performed on or after June 3, 1985,
            for the treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency
            disease (SCID) and for the treatment of Wiskott-Aldrich
            syndrome.

        c.  Effective for services performed on or after August 4, 2010,
            for the treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)
            pursuant to Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) in the
            context of a Medicare-approved, prospective clinical study.

> MDS refers to a group of diverse blood disorders in which the bone
> marrow does not produce enough healthy, functioning blood cells. These
> disorders are varied with regard to clinical characteristics,
> cytologic and pathologic features, and cytogenetics. The abnormal
> production of blood cells in the bone marrow leads to low blood cell
> counts, referred to as cytopenias, which are a hallmark feature of MDS
> along with a dysplastic and hypercellular-appearing bone marrow
>
> Medicare payment for these beneficiaries will be restricted to
> patients enrolled in an approved clinical study. In accordance with
> the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005 (US Public Law
> 109-129) a standard dataset is collected for all allogeneic transplant
> patients in the United States by the Center for International Blood
> and Marrow Transplant Research. The elements in this dataset,
> comprised of two mandatory forms plus one additional form, encompass
> the information we require for a study under CED.
>
> A prospective clinical study seeking Medicare payment for treating a
> beneficiary with allogeneic HSCT for MDS pursuant to CED must meet one
> or more aspects of the following questions:

1.  Prospectively, compared to Medicare beneficiaries with MDS who do
    > not receive HSCT, do Medicare beneficiaries with MDS who receive
    > HSCT have improved outcomes as indicated by:

    -   Relapse-free mortality,

    -   progression free survival,

    -   relapse, and

    -   overall survival?

2.  Prospectively, in Medicare beneficiaries with MDS who receive HSCT,
    > how do International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) scores,
    > patient age, cytopenias, and comorbidities predict the following
    > outcomes:

    -   Relapse-free mortality,

    -   progression free survival,

    -   relapse, and

    -   overall survival?

3.  Prospectively, in Medicare beneficiaries with MDS who receive HSCT,
    > what treatment facility characteristics predict meaningful
    > clinical improvement in the following outcomes:

    -   Relapse-free mortality,

    -   progression free survival,

    -   relapse, and

    -   overall survival?

> In addition, the clinical study must adhere to the following standards
> of scientific integrity and relevance to the Medicare population:

a.  The principal purpose of the research study is to test whether a
    > particular intervention potentially improves the participants'
    > health outcomes.

b.  The research study is well supported by available scientific and
    > medical information or it is intended to clarify or establish the
    > health outcomes of interventions already in common clinical use.

c.  The research study does not unjustifiably duplicate existing
    > studies.

d.  The research study design is appropriate to answer the research
    > question being asked in the study.

e.  The research study is sponsored by an organization or individual
    > capable of executing the proposed study successfully.

f.  The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal
    > regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found at
    > 45 CFR Part 46. If a study is regulated by the Food and Drug
    > Administration (FDA), it must be in compliance with 21 CFR parts
    > 50 and 56.

g.  All aspects of the research study are conducted according to
    > appropriate standards of scientific integrity (see
    > [[http://www.icmje.org]{.underline}](http://www.icmje.org/)).

h.  The research study has a written protocol that clearly addresses, or
    > incorporates by reference, the standards listed here as Medicare
    > requirements for CED coverage.

i.  The clinical research study is not designed to exclusively test
    > toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Trials
    > of all medical technologies measuring therapeutic outcomes as one
    > of the objectives meet this standard only if the disease or
    > condition being studied is life threatening as defined in 21 CFR
    > §312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment options.

j.  The clinical research study is registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov
    > Web site by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the
    > enrollment of the first study subject.

k.  The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of
    > public release of all pre-specified outcomes to be measured
    > including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is
    > terminated early. The results must be made public within 24 months
    > of the end of data collection. If a report is planned to be
    > published in a peer-reviewed journal, then that initial release
    > may be an abstract that meets the requirements of the
    > International Committee of Medical

> Journal Editors (http://www.icmje.org). However a full report of the

l.  The research study protocol must explicitly discuss subpopulations
    > affected by the treatment under investigation, particularly
    > traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the
    > inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment of these
    > populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said
    > populations on the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria
    > are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or
    > retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must
    > discuss why these criteria are necessary.

m.  The research study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are
    > or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population
    > to infer whether Medicare patients may benefit from the
    > intervention. Separate discussions in the protocol may be
    > necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age,
    > disability or Medicaid eligibility.

> Consistent with section 1142 of the Social Security Act, the Agency
> for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ) supports clinical research
> studies that CMS determines meet the above-listed standards and
> address the above-listed research questions.
>
> The clinical research study should also have the following features:

-   It should be a prospective, longitudinal study with clinical
    > information from the period before HSCT and short- and long-term
    > follow-up information.

-   Outcomes should be measured and compared among pre-specified
    > subgroups within the cohort.

-   The study should be powered to make inferences in subgroup analyses.

-   Risk stratification methods should be used to control for selection
    > bias. Data elements to be used in risk stratification models
    > should include:

### Patient selection:

-   Patient Age at diagnosis of MDS and at transplantation

-   Date of onset of MDS

-   Disease classification (specific MDS subtype at diagnosis prior to

# Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy

### (Rev. 10891, Issued: 07-20-21, Effective: 08-07-19, Implementation: 09-20-21)

> ***A.* General**
>
> Cancer is a collection of related diseases of dividing cells that can
> start almost anywhere in or on the body, evade the immune system, and
> invade nearby tissues. Categories of cancer are typically organized by
> the location in the body and specific type of cell. These categories
> may include carcinoma, sarcoma, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma,
> melanoma, and brain and spinal cord tumors. There are also changes to
> these cells that are not considered cancer. These changes include
> hyperplasia---when a cell divides faster than normal---and
> dysplasia---a buildup of extra cells with abnormal shape and
> disorganization.
>
> A person's immune system contains cells to help fight substances that
> are foreign to the body, including cancer. These cells are called
> white blood cells, most of which are lymphocytes. The two main types
> of lymphocytes are B lymphocytes (B-cells) and T lymphocytes
> (T-cells). B-cells generate and release antibodies to fight infection,
> especially bacterial infections, while T-cells employ a number of
> other mechanisms to fight abnormal cells such as cancer. One type of
> therapy that leverages the immune system---immunotherapy---is Chimeric
> Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.
>
> CAR T-cells have been genetically altered in order to improve the
> ability of the T-cells to fight cancer. The genetic modification
> creating a CAR can enhance the ability of the T-cell to recognize and
> attach to a specific protein, called an antigen, on the surface of a
> cancer cell.

# - Inpatient Hospital Stays for the Treatment of Alcoholism

### (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

A.  **Inpatient Hospital Stay for Alcohol Detoxification**

> Many hospitals provide detoxification services during the more acute
> stages of alcoholism or alcohol withdrawal. When the high probability
> or occurrence of medical complications (e.g., delirium, confusion,
> trauma, or unconsciousness) during detoxification for acute alcoholism
> or alcohol withdrawal necessitates the constant availability of
> physicians and/or complex medical equipment found only in the hospital
> setting, inpatient hospital care during this period is considered
> reasonable and necessary and is therefore covered under the program.
> Generally, detoxification can be accomplished within two to three days
> with an occasional need for up to five days where the patient's
> condition dictates. This limit (five days) may be extended in an
> individual case where there is a need for a longer period for
> detoxification for a particular patient.
>
> In such cases, however, there should be documentation by a physician
> which substantiates that a longer period of detoxification was
> reasonable and necessary. When the detoxification needs of an
> individual no longer require an inpatient hospital setting, coverage
> should be denied on the basis that inpatient hospital care is not
> reasonable and necessary as required by
> [[§1862(a)(l)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Social Security Act (the Act).
>
> Following detoxification a patient may be transferred to an inpatient
> rehabilitation unit or discharged to a residential treatment program
> or outpatient treatment setting.

### Inpatient Hospital Stay for Alcohol Rehabilitation

> Hospitals may also provide structured inpatient alcohol rehabilitation
> programs to the chronic alcoholic. These programs are composed
> primarily of coordinated educational and psychotherapeutic services
> provided on a group basis. Depending on the subject matter, a series
> of lectures, discussions, films, and group therapy sessions are led by
> either physicians, psychologists, or alcoholism counselors from the
> hospital or various outside organizations. In addition, individual
> psychotherapy and family counseling (see [§70.1]{.underline}) may be
> provided in selected cases. These programs are conducted under the
> supervision and direction of a physician. Patients may directly enter
> an inpatient hospital rehabilitation program after having undergone
> detoxification in the same hospital or in another hospital or may
> enter an inpatient hospital rehabilitation program without prior
> hospitalization for detoxification.
>
> Alcohol rehabilitation can be provided in a variety of settings other
> than the hospital setting. In order for an inpatient hospital stay for
> alcohol rehabilitation to be covered under Medicare it must be
> medically necessary for the care to be provided in the inpatient
> hospital setting rather than in a less costly facility or on an
> outpatient basis. Inpatient hospital care for receipt of an alcohol
> rehabilitation program would generally be medically necessary where
> either (l) there is documentation by the physician that recent alcohol
> rehabilitation services in a less intensive setting or on an
> outpatient basis have proven unsuccessful and, as a consequence, the
> patient requires the supervision and intensity of services which can
> only be found in the controlled environment of the hospital, or (2)
> only the hospital environment can assure the medical management or
> control of the patient's concomitant conditions during the course of
> alcohol rehabilitation. (However, a patient's concomitant condition
> may make the use of certain alcohol treatment modalities medically
> inappropriate.)
>
> In addition, the "active treatment" criteria (see the Medicare Benefit
> Policy Manual, Chapter 2, "Inpatient Psychiatric Hospital Services,"
> §20) should be applied to psychiatric care in the general hospital as
> well as to psychiatric care in a psychiatric hospital. Since
> alcoholism is classifiable as a psychiatric condition the "active
> treatment" criteria must also be met in order for alcohol
> rehabilitation services to be covered under Medicare. (Thus, it is the
> combined need for "active treatment" and for covered care which can
> only be provided in the inpatient hospital setting, rather than the
> fact that rehabilitation immediately follows a period of
> detoxification which provides the basis for coverage of inpatient
> hospital alcohol rehabilitation programs.)
>
> Generally 16-19 days of rehabilitation services are sufficient to
> bring a patient to a point where care could be continued in other than
> an inpatient hospital setting. An inpatient hospital stay for alcohol
> rehabilitation may be extended beyond this limit in an individual case
> where a longer period of alcohol rehabilitation is medically
> necessary. In such cases, however, there should be documentation by a
> physician which substantiates the need for such care. Where the
> rehabilitation needs of an individual no longer require an inpatient
> hospital setting, coverage should be denied on the basis that
> inpatient hospital care is not reasonable and necessary as required by
> [[§1862 (a)(l)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Act.
>
> Subsequent admissions to the inpatient hospital setting for alcohol
> rehabilitation follow-up, reinforcement, or "recap" treatments are
> considered to be readmissions (rather than an extension of the
> original stay) and must meet the requirements of this section for
> coverage under Medicare. Prior admissions to the inpatient hospital
> setting - either in the same hospital or in a different hospital - may
> be an indication that the "active treatment" requirements are not met
> (i.e., there is no reasonable expectation of improvement) and the stay

### Combined Alcohol Detoxification/Rehabilitation Programs

> A/B MACs should apply the guidelines in A. and B. above to both phases
> of a combined inpatient hospital alcohol detoxification/rehabilitation
> program. Not all patients who require the inpatient hospital setting
> for detoxification also need the inpatient hospital setting for
> rehabilitation. (See
> [[§130.1]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) for
> coverage of
>
> outpatient hospital alcohol rehabilitation services.) Where the
> inpatient hospital setting is medically necessary for both alcohol
> detoxification and rehabilitation, generally a 3-week period is
> reasonable and necessary to bring the patient to the point where care
> can be continued in other than an inpatient hospital setting.
>
> Decisions regarding reasonableness and necessity of treatment, the
> need for an inpatient hospital level of care, and length of treatment
> should be made by the A/B MAC (A) based on accepted medical practice
> with the advice of their medical consultant. (In hospitals under PSRO
> review, PSRO determinations of medical necessity of services and
> appropriateness of the level of care at which services are provided
> are binding on the A/B MAC (A) for purposes of adjudicating claims for

# - Outpatient Hospital Services for Treatment of Alcoholism

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-22**
>
> Some hospitals also provide services on an outpatient basis, either
> individually or as part of a day hospitalization program, for
> treatment of alcoholism. These services may include, for example, drug
> therapy, psychotherapy, and patient education and may be furnished by
> physicians, psychologists, nurses, and alcoholism counselors to
> individuals who have been discharged from an inpatient hospital stay
> for treatment of alcoholism and require continued treatment or to
> individuals from the community who require treatment but do not
> require the inpatient hospital setting.
>
> Coverage is available for both diagnostic and therapeutic services
> furnished for the treatment of alcoholism by the hospital to
> outpatients subject to the same rules applicable to outpatient

>
> While there is no coverage for day hospitalization programs, per se,
> individual services which meet the requirements in the Medicare
> Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 6, "Hospital Services Covered Under
> Part B,"
>
> §§20 may be covered. (Meals, transportation, and recreational and
> social activities do not fall within the scope of covered outpatient

>
> All services must be reasonable and necessary for diagnosis or
> treatment of the patient's condition (see the Medicare Benefit Policy
> Manual, Chapter 16, "General Exclusions from Coverage," §20). Thus,
> educational services and family counseling would only be covered where

# - Chemical Aversion Therapy for Treatment of Alcoholism

### (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> Chemical aversion therapy is a behavior modification technique that is
> used in the treatment of alcoholism. Chemical aversion therapy
> facilitates alcohol abstinence through the development of conditioned
> aversions to the taste, smell, and sight of alcohol beverages. This is
> accomplished by repeatedly pairing alcohol with unpleasant symptoms
> (e.g., nausea) which have been induced by one of several chemical
> agents. While a number of drugs have been employed in chemical
> aversion therapy, the three most commonly used are emetine,
> apomorphine, and lithium. None of the drugs being used, however, have
> yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration specifically for
> use in chemical aversion therapy for alcoholism.
>
> Accordingly, when these drugs are being employed in conjunction with
> this therapy, patients undergoing this treatment need to be kept under
> medical observation.
>
> Available evidence indicates that chemical aversion therapy may be an
> effective component of certain alcoholism treatment programs,
> particularly as part of multi-modality treatment programs which
> include other behavioral techniques and therapies, such as
> psychotherapy. Based on this evidence, the Centers for Medicare &
> Medicaid Services' medical consultants have recommended that chemical
> aversion therapy be covered under Medicare. However, since chemical
> aversion therapy is a demanding therapy which may not
>
> be appropriate for all Medicare beneficiaries needing treatment for
> alcoholism, a physician should certify to the appropriateness of
> chemical aversion therapy in the individual case. Therefore, if
> chemical aversion therapy for treatment of alcoholism is determined to
> be reasonable and necessary for an individual patient, it is covered
> under Medicare.
>
> When it is medically necessary for a patient to receive chemical
> aversion therapy as a hospital inpatient, coverage for care in that
> setting is available. (See [§130.1]{.underline} regarding coverage of
> multi-modality treatment programs.) Follow-up treatments for chemical
> aversion therapy can generally be provided on an outpatient basis.
> Thus, where a patient is admitted as an inpatient for receipt of
> chemical aversion therapy, there must be documentation by the
> physician of the need in the individual case for the inpatient
> hospital admission.
>
> Decisions regarding reasonableness and necessity of treatment and the
> need for an inpatient hospital level of care should be made by the A/B
> MAC (A) based on accepted medical practice with the advice of their
> medical consultant. (In hospitals under Quality Improvement
> Organization (QIO) review, QIO determinations of medical necessity of

> "Physician/Practitioners Billing," §10; the Medicare General
> Information, Eligibility, and Entitlement Manual, Chapter 3,

# - Treatment of Drug Abuse (Chemical Dependency)

### (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recognizes that there are
> similarities between the approach to treatment of drug abuse and
> alcohol detoxification and rehabilitation. However, the intensity and
> duration of treatment for drug abuse may vary (depending on the
> particular substance(s) of abuse, duration of use, and the patient's
> medical and emotional condition) from the duration of treatment or
> intensity needed to treat
>
> alcoholism. Accordingly, when it is medically necessary for a patient
> to receive detoxification and/or rehabilitation for drug substance
> abuse as a hospital inpatient, coverage for care in that setting is
> available. Coverage is also available for treatment services that are
> provided in the outpatient department of a hospital to patients who,
> for example, have been discharged from an inpatient stay for the
> treatment of drug substance abuse or who require treatment but do not
> require the availability and intensity of services found only in the

>
> **CIM 35-99**
>
> Abortions are not covered Medicare procedures except:

1.  If the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest; or

2.  In the case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical
    injury, or physical illness, including a life-endangering physical
    condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself, that

# - Breast Reconstruction Following Mastectomy

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-47**
>
> During recent years, there has been a considerable change in the
> treatment of diseases of the breast such as fibrocystic disease and
> cancer. While extirpation of the disease remains of primary
> importance, the quality of life following initial treatment is
> increasingly recognized as of great concern. The increased use of
> breast reconstruction procedures is due to several factors:

-   A change in epidemiology of breast cancer, including an apparent
    > increase in incidence;

-   Improved surgical skills and techniques;

-   The continuing development of better prostheses; and

-   Increasing awareness by physicians of the importance of postsurgical
    > psychological adjustment.

> Reconstruction of the affected and the contralateral unaffected breast
> following a medically necessary mastectomy is considered a relatively
> safe and effective noncosmetic procedure. Accordingly, program payment
> may be made for breast reconstruction surgery following removal of a
> breast for any medical reason.
>
> Program payment may not be made for breast reconstruction for cosmetic
> reasons. (Cosmetic surgery is excluded from coverage under

> Electrical Osteogenic Stimulators

### General

> Electrical stimulation to augment bone repair can be attained either
> invasively or non-invasively. Invasive devices provide electrical
> stimulation directly at the fracture site either through
> percutaneously placed
>
> cathodes or by implantation of a coiled cathode wire into the fracture
> site. The power pack for the latter device is implanted into soft
> tissue near the fracture site and subcutaneously connected to the
> cathode, creating a self-contained system with no external components.
> The power supply for the former device is externally placed and the
> leads connected to the inserted cathodes. With the non-invasive
> device, opposing pads, wired to an external power supply, are placed
> over the cast. An electromagnetic field is created between the pads at
> the fracture site.

B.  ### Nationally Covered Indications

    1.  **Noninvasive Stimulator**

> The noninvasive stimulator device is covered only for the following
> indications:

-   Nonunion of long bone fractures;

-   Failed fusion, where a minimum of 9 months has elapsed since the
    last surgery;

-   Congenital pseudarthroses;

-   Effective July 1, 1996, as an adjunct to spinal fusion surgery for
    patients at high risk of pseudarthrosis due to previously failed
    spinal fusion at the same site or for those undergoing multiple
    level fusion. A multiple level fusion involves 3 or more vertebrae
    (e.g., L3-L5, L4-S1, etc).

-   Effective September 15, 1980, nonunion of long bone fractures is
    considered to exist only after 6 or more months have elapsed without
    healing of the fracture.

-   Effective April 1, 2000, nonunion of long bone fractures is
    considered to exist only when serial radiographs have confirmed that
    fracture healing has ceased for **3** or more months prior to
    starting treatment with the electrical osteogenic stimulator. Serial
    radiographs must include a minimum of 2 sets of radiographs, each
    including multiple views of the fracture site, separated by a
    minimum of 90 days.

> Ultrasonic Osteogenic Stimulators

### General

> An ultrasonic osteogenic stimulator is a noninvasive device that emits
> low intensity, pulsed ultrasound. The device is applied to the surface
> of the skin at the fracture site and ultrasound waves are emitted via
> a
>
> conductive coupling gel to stimulate fracture healing. The ultrasonic
> osteogenic stimulators are not be used concurrently with other
> non-invasive osteogenic devices.

### Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective January 1, 2001, ultrasonic osteogenic stimulators are
> covered as medically reasonable and necessary for the treatment of
> nonunion fractures. In demonstrating non-union fractures, CMS expects:

-   A minimum of **2** sets of radiographs, obtained prior to starting
    treatment with the osteogenic stimulator, separated by a minimum of
    90 days. Each radiograph set must include multiple views of the
    fracture site accompanied with a written interpretation by a
    physician stating that there has been no clinically significant
    evidence of fracture healing between the **2** sets of radiographs;
    and,

-   Indications that the patient failed at least one surgical
    > intervention for the treatment of the fracture.

-   Effective April 27, 2005, upon reconsideration of ultrasound
    stimulation for nonunion fracture healing, CMS determines that the
    evidence is adequate to conclude that noninvasive ultrasound
    stimulation for the treatment of nonunion bone fractures prior to
    surgical intervention is reasonable and necessary. In demonstrating
    non-union fractures, CMS expects:

-   A minimum of 2 sets of radiographs, obtained prior to starting
    treatment with the osteogenic stimulator, separated by a minimum of
    90 days. Each radiograph set must include multiple views of the
    fracture site accompanied with a written interpretation by a
    physician stating that there has been no clinically significant
    evidence of fracture healing between the 2 sets of radiographs.

### Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> Nonunion fractures of the skull, vertebrae and those that are
> tumor-related are excluded from coverage. Ultrasonic osteogenic
> stimulators may not be used concurrently with other non-invasive
> osteogenic devices. Ultrasonic osteogenic stimulators for fresh

# - Arthroscopic Lavage and Arthroscopic Debridement for the Osteoarthritic Knee (Effective June 11, 2004)

### (Rev. 14, 06-10-04)

> Arthroscopy is a surgical procedure that allows the direct

> function, current practice does not recognize the benefit of lavage
> alone for the reduction of mechanical symptoms. Arthroscopy also
> permits the removal of any loose bodies from the interior joint space,
> a procedure termed debridement.
>
> Debridement, when used alone or not otherwise specified, may include
> low volume lavage or washout. Osteoarthritis is a chronic and painful
> joint disease caused by degeneration. The American College of
> Rheumatology defines a patient diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee

-   Over 50 years of age;

-   Less than 30 minutes of morning stiffness;

-   Crepitus (noisy, grating sound) on active motion;

-   Bony tenderness;

-   Bony enlargement;

-   No palpable warmth of synovium;

-   ESR \<40mm/hr;

-   Rheumatoid Factor \<1:40; or,

-   Synovial fluid signs.

### Arthroscopic lavage used alone for the osteoarthritic knee;

-   Arthroscopic debridement for osteoarthritic patients presenting with
    knee pain only; or,

-   Arthroscopic debridement and lavage with or without debridement for
    patients presenting with severe osteoarthritis ((Severe
    osteoarthritis is defined in the Outerbridge classification scale,
    grades III and IV. Outerbridge is the most commonly used clinical
    scale that classifies the severity of joint degeneration of the knee
    by compartments and grades. Grade I is defined as softening or
    blistering of joint cartilage. Grade II is defined as fragmentation
    or fissuring in an area \<1 cm. Grade III presents clinically with
    cartilage fragmentation or fissuring in an area \>1 cm. Grade IV

# -- Percutaneous Image-guided Lumbar Decompression (PILD) for Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS) (Various Effective Dates Below)

### (Rev. 200, Issued: 07-25-17, Effective: 12-07-16, Implementation: 06-27-17)

A.  **General**

> PILD is a posterior decompression of the lumbar spine performed under
> indirect image guidance without any direct visualization of the
> surgical area. This is a procedure proposed as a treatment for
> symptomatic LSS unresponsive to conservative therapy. This procedure
> is generally described as a
>
> non-invasive procedure using specially designed instruments to

> (e.g., fluoroscopic, CT) with the assistance of contrast media to
> identify and monitor the compressed area via epiduragram.

### Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective for dates of service specified below, the Centers for
> Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has determined that PILD will be
> covered by Medicare when provided in a clinical study under section
> 1862(a)(1)(E) of the Social Security Act (the Act) through Coverage
> with Evidence Development (CED) for beneficiaries with LSS who are
> enrolled in an approved clinical study that meets the criteria in
> section I or II below:

I.  Effective for services performed on or after January 9, 2014, PILD
    will be covered by Medicare through CED for beneficiaries with LSS
    who are enrolled in an approved clinical study that meets the
    following criteria. CMS has a particular interest in improved
    beneficiary function and quality of life, specific characteristics
    that identify patients who may benefit from the procedure, and the
    duration of benefit. A clinical study seeking Medicare payment for
    PILD for LSS must address one or more aspects of the following
    questions in a prospective, randomized, controlled design using
    current validated and reliable measurement instruments and
    clinically appropriate comparator treatments, including appropriate
    medical or surgical interventions or a sham controlled arm, for
    patients randomized to the non-PILD group.

> The study protocol must specify a statistical analysis and a minimum
> length of patient follow up time that evaluates the effect of
> beneficiary characteristics on patient health outcomes as well as the
> duration of benefit.

i.  Does PILD provide a clinically meaningful improvement of function
    > and/or quality of life in Medicare beneficiaries with LSS compared
    > to other treatments?

ii. Does PILD provide clinically meaningful reduction in pain in
    > Medicare beneficiaries with LSS compared to other treatments?

iii. Does PILD affect the overall clinical management of LSS and
     > decision making, including use of other medical treatments or
     > services, compared to other treatments?

> These studies must be designed so that the contribution of treatments
> in addition to the procedure under study are either controlled for or
> analyzed in such a way as to determine their impact.

a.  The principal purpose of the research study is to test whether a
    > particular intervention potentially improves the participants'
    > health outcomes.

b.  The research study is well supported by available scientific and
    > medical information or it is intended to clarify or establish the
    > health outcomes of interventions already in common clinical use.

c.  The research study does not unjustifiably duplicate existing
    > studies.

d.  The research study design is appropriate to answer the research
    > question being asked in the study.

e.  The research study is sponsored by an organization or individual
    > capable of executing the proposed study successfully.

f.  The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal
    > regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found at
    > 45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 46. If a study is
    > regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it must be in
    > compliance with 21 CFR parts 50 and 56.

g.  All aspects of the research study are conducted according to
    > appropriate standards of scientific integrity (see
    > http://www.icmje.org).

h.  The research study has a written protocol that clearly addresses, or
    > incorporates by reference, the standards listed here as Medicare
    > requirements for CED coverage.

i.  The clinical research study is not designed to exclusively test
    > toxicity or disease pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Trials
    > of all medical technologies measuring therapeutic outcomes as one
    > of the objectives meet this standard only if the disease or
    > condition being studied is life threatening as defined in 21
    > CFR§312.81(a) and the patient has no other viable treatment
    > options.

j.  The clinical research study is registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov
    > website by the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the
    > enrollment of the first study subject.

k.  The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of
    > public release of all prespecified outcomes to be measured
    > including release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is
    > terminated early. The results must be made public within 24 months
    > of the end of data collection. If a report is planned to be
    > published in a peer reviewed journal, then that initial release
    > may be an abstract that meets the requirements of the
    > International Committee of Medical Journal Editors
    > (http://www.icmje.org).

l.  The research study protocol must explicitly discuss subpopulations
    > affected by the treatment under investigation, particularly
    > traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies, how the
    > inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment of these
    > populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of said
    > populations on the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria
    > are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment or
    > retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must
    > discuss why these criteria are necessary.

m.  The research study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are
    > or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population
    > to infer whether Medicare patients may benefit from the
    > intervention. Separate discussions in the protocol may be
    > necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age,
    > disability or Medicaid eligibility.

> Consistent with section 1142 of the Act, the Agency for Healthcare
> Research and Quality (AHRQ) supports clinical research studies that
> CMS determines meet the above-listed standards and address the
> above-listed research questions.

II. Effective for services performed on or after December 7, 2016, CMS
    will cover through a prospective, longitudinal study PILD procedures
    using an FDA-approved/cleared device that completed a CMS- approved
    randomized control trial (RCT) that met the criteria listed in
    section I above.

> The CMS-approved prospective, longitudinal study must answer at least
> one of the following questions:

i.  Does PILD provide a clinically meaningful improvement of function
    > (e.g., reduced acute and post-acute hospitalizations, nursing home
    > care or inpatient rehabilitation services) and/or quality of life
    > in Medicare beneficiaries with LSS compared to other treatments?

ii. Does PILD provide a clinically meaningful reduction in pain (e.g.,
    > as measured by class, dose, duration of prescription pain
    > medication use) in Medicare beneficiaries with LSS compared to
    > other treatments?

iii. Does PILD affect the overall clinical management of LSS and
     > decision making, including use of other medical treatments or
     > services (e.g., repeat PILD procedures, other interventions and
     > surgical treatments), compared to other treatments?

> The prospective, longitudinal study must also meet the following
> criteria:

1.  The protocol must specify a statistical analysis and a minimum
    length of patient follow-up time that evaluates the effect of
    beneficiary characteristics on patient health outcomes as well as
    the duration of the benefit.

2.  The eligibility requirements, both inclusion and exclusion criteria
    that were specified in the CMS-approved RCT protocol, must be
    maintained in the new prospective, longitudinal study.

3.  All study sites and study results must be listed in the
    > ClinicalTrials.gov database.

> All CMS-approved clinical research studies must adhere to the
> following standards of scientific integrity and relevance to the
> Medicare population:

a.  The principal purpose of the study is to test whether the item or
    service meaningfully improves health outcomes of affected
    beneficiaries who are represented by the enrolled subjects.

b.  The rationale for the study is well supported by available
    > scientific and medical evidence.

c.  The study results are not anticipated to unjustifiably duplicate
    > existing knowledge.

d.  The study design is methodologically appropriate and the anticipated
    number of enrolled subjects is sufficient to answer the research
    question(s) being asked in the National Coverage Determination.

e.  The study is sponsored by an organization or individual capable of
    completing it successfully.

f.  The research study is in compliance with all applicable Federal
    regulations concerning the protection of human subjects found in the
    CFR at 45 CFR Part 46. If a study is regulated by the FDA, it is
    also in compliance with 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56. In addition, to
    further enhance the protection of human subjects in studies
    conducted under CED, the study must provide and obtain meaningful
    informed consent from patients regarding the risks associated with
    the study items and/or services, and the use and eventual
    disposition of the collected data.

g.  All aspects of the study are conducted according to appropriate
    standards of scientific integrity.

h.  The study has a written protocol that clearly demonstrates adherence
    to the standards listed here as Medicare requirements.

i.  The study is not designed to exclusively test toxicity or disease
    pathophysiology in healthy individuals. Such studies may meet this
    requirement only if the disease or condition being studied is life
    threatening as defined in 21 CFR §312.81(a) and the patient has no
    other viable treatment options.

j.  The clinical research studies and [registries are registered on the
    www.ClinicalTrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/) website by
    the principal sponsor/investigator prior to the enrollment of the
    first study subject. Registries are also registered in the AHRQ
    Registry of Patient Registries (RoPR).

k.  The research study protocol specifies the method and timing of
    public release of all prespecified outcomes to be measured including
    release of outcomes if outcomes are negative or study is terminated
    early. The results must be made public within 12 months of the
    study's primary completion date, which is the date the final subject
    had final data collection for the primary endpoint, even if the
    trial does not achieve its primary aim. The results must include
    number started/completed, summary results for primary and secondary
    outcome measures, statistical analyses, and adverse events. Final
    results must be reported in a publicly accessibly manner; either in
    a peer-reviewed scientific journal (in print or on-line), in an
    on-line publicly accessible registry dedicated to the dissemination
    of clinical trial information such as ClinicalTrials.gov, or in
    journals willing to publish in abbreviated format (e.g., for studies
    with negative or incomplete results).

l.  The study protocol must explicitly discuss beneficiary
    subpopulations affected by the item or service under investigation,
    particularly traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical
    studies, how the inclusion and exclusion criteria effect enrollment
    of these populations, and a plan for the retention and reporting of
    said populations in the trial. If the inclusion and exclusion
    criteria are expected to have a negative effect on the recruitment
    or retention of underrepresented populations, the protocol must
    discuss why these criteria are necessary.

m.  The study protocol explicitly discusses how the results are or are
    not expected to be generalizable to affected beneficiary
    subpopulations. Separate discussions in the protocol may be
    necessary for populations eligible for Medicare due to age,
    disability or Medicaid eligibility.

# - Induced Lesions of Nerve Tracts

### (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> Surgically induced lesions of nerve tracts which involve destruction
> of nerve tissue are primarily indicated for controlling the chronic or
> acute pain arising from conditions such as terminal cancer or lumbar
> degenerative arthritis. Induced lesions of nerve tracts may be
> produced by surgical cutting of the nerve (rhizolysis), chemical
> destruction of the nerve, or by creation of a radio-frequency lesion
> (electrocautery). Accordingly, program payment may be made for these
> denervation procedures when used in selected cases (concurred in by
> the A/B MAC's medical staff) to treat chronic pain.
>
> Note that these procedures differ from those employing implanted
> electrodes and associated equipment to control pain in that the nerve
> fibers are ablated rather than stimulated and no electronic equipment
> is required by the patient after the operation.

### Not Covered

> While electric nerve stimulation has been employed to control chronic
> intractable pain for some time, its use in the treatment of motor
> function disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, is a recent
> innovation, and the medical effectiveness of such therapy has not been
> verified by scientifically controlled studies. Therefore, where
> electric nerve stimulation is employed to treat motor function
> disorders, no reimbursement may be made for the stimulator or for the
> services related to its implantation since this treatment cannot be
> considered reasonable and necessary. See [§§30.1]{.underline} and
> [160.7]{.underline}.

# - Electrical Nerve Stimulators

### (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> Two general classifications of electrical nerve stimulators are
> employed to treat chronic intractable pain: peripheral nerve
> stimulators and central nervous system stimulators.

### Implanted Peripheral Nerve Stimulators

> Payment may be made under the prosthetic device benefit for implanted
> peripheral nerve stimulators. Use of this stimulator involves
> implantation of electrodes around a selected peripheral nerve. The
> stimulating electrode is connected by an insulated lead to a receiver
> unit which is implanted under the skin at a depth not greater than 1/2
> inch.
>
> Stimulation is induced by a generator connected to an antenna unit
> which is attached to the skin surface over the receiver unit.
> Implantation of electrodes requires surgery and usually necessitates
> an operating room.
>
> **NOTE:** Peripheral nerve stimulators may also be employed to assess
> a patient's suitability for continued treatment with an electric nerve
> stimulator. As explained in
>
> [§160.7.1]{.underline}, such use of the stimulator is covered as part
> of the total diagnostic service furnished to the beneficiary rather
> than as a prosthesis.

### Central Nervous System Stimulators (Dorsal Column and Depth Brain Stimulators)

> The implantation of central nervous system stimulators may be covered
> as therapies for the relief of chronic intractable pain, subject to
> the following conditions:

### Types of Implantations

> There are two types of implantations covered by this instruction:

-   Dorsal Column (Spinal Cord) Neurostimulation - The surgical
    > implantation of neurostimulator electrodes within the dura mater
    > (endodural) or the percutaneous insertion of electrodes in the
    > epidural space is covered.

-   Depth Brain Neurostimulation - The stereotactic implantation of
    > electrodes in the deep brain (e.g., thalamus and periaqueductal
    > gray matter) is covered.

### Conditions for Coverage

> No payment may be made for the implantation of dorsal column or depth
> brain stimulators or services and supplies related to such
> implantation, unless all of the conditions listed below have been met:

-   The implantation of the stimulator is used only as a late resort (if
    > not a last resort) for patients with chronic intractable pain;

-   With respect to item a, other treatment modalities (pharmacological,
    > surgical, physical, or psychological therapies) have been tried
    > and did not prove satisfactory, or are judged to be unsuitable or
    > contraindicated for the given patient;

-   Patients have undergone careful screening, evaluation and diagnosis
    > by a multidisciplinary team prior to implantation. (Such screening
    > must include psychological, as well as physical evaluation);

-   All the facilities, equipment, and professional and support
    > personnel required for the proper diagnosis, treatment training,
    > and follow up of the patient (including that required to satisfy
    > item c) must be available; and

-   Demonstration of pain relief with a temporarily implanted electrode
    > precedes permanent implantation.

> A/B MACs may find it helpful to work with Quality Improvement
> Organizations to obtain the information needed to apply these
> conditions to claims.
>

# - Assessing Patients Suitability for Electrical Nerve Stimulation Therapy

### (Rev. 149, Issued: 11-30-12, Effective: 06-08-12, Implementation: 01-07-13)

> Electrical nerve stimulation is an accepted modality for assessing a
> patient's suitability for ongoing treatment with a transcutaneous or
> an implanted nerve stimulator.
>
> Accordingly, program payment may be made for the following techniques
> when used to determine the potential therapeutic usefulness of an
> electrical nerve stimulator:

### Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)

> This technique involves attachment of a transcutaneous nerve
> stimulator to the surface of the skin over the peripheral nerve to be
> stimulated. It is used by the patient on a trial basis and its
> effectiveness in modulating pain is monitored by the physician, or
> physical therapist. Generally, the physician or physical therapist is
> able to determine whether the patient is likely to derive a
> significant therapeutic benefit from continuous use of a
> transcutaneous stimulator within a trial period of one month; in a few
> cases this determination may take longer to make. Document the medical
> necessity for such services which are furnished beyond the first
> month. (See [§160.13]{.underline} for an explanation of coverage of
> medically necessary supplies for the effective use of TENS.)
>
> If TENS significantly alleviates pain, it may be considered as primary
> treatment; if it produces no relief or greater discomfort than the
> original pain electrical nerve stimulation therapy is ruled out.
> However, where TENS produces incomplete relief, further evaluation
> with percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may be considered to
> determine whether an implanted peripheral nerve stimulator would
> provide significant relief from pain.
>
> Usually, the physician or physical therapist providing the services
> will furnish the equipment necessary for assessment. Where the
> physician or physical therapist advises the patient to rent the TENS
> from a supplier during the trial period rather than supplying it
> himself/herself, program payment may be made for rental of the TENS as
> well as for the services of the physician or physical therapist who is
> evaluating its use. However, the combined program payment which is
> made for the physician's or physical therapist's services and the
> rental of the stimulator from a supplier should not exceed the amount
> which would be payable for the total service, including the
> stimulator, furnished by the physician or physical therapist alone.

### Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (PENS)

> This diagnostic procedure which involves stimulation of peripheral
> nerves by a needle electrode inserted through the skin is performed
> only in a physician's office, clinic, or hospital outpatient
> department. Therefore, it is covered only when performed by a
> physician or incident to physician's service. If pain is effectively
> controlled by percutaneous stimulation, implantation of electrodes is
> warranted.
>
> As in the case of TENS (described in subsection A), generally the
> physician should be able to determine whether the patient is likely to
> derive a significant therapeutic benefit from continuing use of an
> implanted nerve stimulator within a trial period of 1 month. In a few
> cases, this determination may take longer to make. The medical
> necessity for such diagnostic services which are furnished beyond the
> first month must be documented.
>
> **NOTE:** Electrical nerve stimulators do not prevent pain but only
> alleviate pain as it occurs. A patient can be taught how to employ the
> stimulator, and once this is done, can use it safely and effectively
> without direct physician supervision. Consequently, it is
> inappropriate for a patient to visit his/her physician, physical
> therapist, or an outpatient clinic on a continuing basis for treatment
> of pain with electrical nerve stimulation. Once it is determined that
> electrical nerve stimulation should be continued as therapy and the
> patient has been trained to use the stimulator, it is expected that a
> stimulator will be implanted or the patient will employ the TENS on a
> continual basis in his/her home.
>
> Electrical nerve stimulation treatments furnished by a physician in
> his/her office, by a physical therapist or outpatient clinic are
> excluded from coverage by §1862(a)(1) of the Act. (See §160.7 for an
> explanation of coverage of the therapeutic use of implanted peripheral
> nerve stimulators under the prosthetic devices benefit.) See §160.27
> for an explanation of coverage of the therapeutic use of TENS under
> the durable medical equipment benefit.

# - Electroencephalographic Monitoring During Surgical Procedures Involving the Cerebral Vasculature

> **(Rev. 48, Issued: 03-17-06; Effective/Implementation Dates:
> 06-19-06)**
>
> **CIM 35-57**
>
> Electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring is a safe and reliable
> technique for the assessment of gross cerebral blood flow during
> general anesthesia and is covered under Medicare. Very characteristic
> changes in the EEG occur when cerebral perfusion is inadequate for
> cerebral function. EEG monitoring as an indirect measure of cerebral
> perfusion requires the expertise of an electroencephalographer, a
> neurologist trained in EEG, or an advanced EEG technician for its
> proper interpretation.
>
> The EEG monitoring may be covered routinely in carotid
> endarterectomies and in other neurological procedures where cerebral
> perfusion could be reduced. Such other procedures might include
> aneurysm surgery where hypotensive anesthesia is used or other
> cerebral vascular procedures where cerebral blood flow may be
> interrupted.

# -- Electroencephalographic (EEG) Monitoring During Open-Heart Surgery *(RETIRED)*

#### *(Rev. 11892; Issued: 03-09-23; Effective: 04-10-23; Implementation:04-10-23)*

> Effective December 18, 2014, NCD 160.9 is *retired.*

# - Evoked Response Tests

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 50-31**
>
> Evoked response tests, including brain stem evoked response and visual
> evoked response tests, are generally accepted as safe and effective
> diagnostic tools. These tests measure brain responses to repetitive
> visual, click or other stimuli. Program payment may be made for these
> procedures.

# - Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulator (NMES)

### (Rev. 55, Issued: 05-05-06, Effective: 10-01-06, Implementation: 10-02-06)

> Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) involves the use of a
> device which transmits an electrical impulse to the skin over selected
> muscle groups by way of electrodes. There are two broad categories of
> NMES. One type of device stimulates the muscle when the patient is in
> a resting state to treat muscle atrophy. The second type is used to
> enhance functional activity of neurologically impaired patients.
>
> Treatment of Muscle Atrophy
>
> Coverage of NMES to treat muscle atrophy is limited to the treatment
> of disuse atrophy where nerve supply to the muscle is intact,
> including brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves, and other
> non-neurological reasons for disuse atrophy. Some examples would be
> casting or splinting of a limb, contracture due to scarring of soft
> tissue as in burn lesions, and hip replacement surgery (until orthotic
> training begins). (See [§160.13]{.underline} for an explanation of
> coverage of medically necessary supplies for the effective use of
> NMES.)
>
> Use for Walking in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)
>
> The type of NMES that is use to enhance the ability to walk of SCI
> patients is commonly referred to as functional electrical stimulation
> (FES). These devices are surface units that use electrical impulses to
> activate paralyzed or weak muscles in precise sequence.
>
> Coverage for the use of NMES/FES is limited to SCI patients for
> walking, who have completed a training program which consists of at
> least 32 physical therapy sessions with the device over a period of
> three months. The trial period of physical therapy will enable the
> physician treating the patient for his or her spinal cord injury to
> properly evaluate the person's ability to use these devices frequently
> and for the long term. Physical therapy necessary to perform this
> training must be directly performed by the physical therapist as part
> of a one-on-one training program.
>
> The goal of physical therapy must be to train SCI patients on the use
> of NMES/FES devices to achieve walking, not to reverse or retard
> muscle atrophy.
>
> Coverage for NMES/FES for walking will be covered in SCI patients with
> all of the following characteristics:

1.  Persons with intact lower motor unite (L1 and below) (both muscle
    > and peripheral nerve);

2.  Persons with muscle and joint stability for weight bearing at upper
    > and lower extremities that can demonstrate balance and control to
    > maintain an upright support posture independently;

3.  Persons that demonstrate brisk muscle contraction to NMES and have
    > sensory perception electrical stimulation sufficient for muscle
    > contraction;

4.  Persons that possess high motivation, commitment and cognitive
    ability to use such devices for walking;

5.  Persons that can transfer independently and can demonstrate
    independent standing tolerance for at least 3 minutes;

6.  Persons that can demonstrate hand and finger function to manipulate
    > controls;

7.  Persons with at least 6-month post recovery spinal cord injury and
    > restorative surgery;

8.  Persons with hip and knee degenerative disease and no history of
    > long bone fracture secondary to osteoporosis; and

9.  Persons who have demonstrated a willingness to use the device
    > long-term.

> The NMES/FES for walking will not be covered in SCI patient with any
> of the following:

1.  Persons with cardiac pacemakers;

2.  Severe scoliosis or severe osteoporosis;

3.  Skin disease or cancer at area of stimulation;

4.  Irreversible contracture; or

5.  Autonomic dysflexia.

> The only settings where therapists with the sufficient skills to
> provide these services are employed, are inpatient hospitals;
> outpatient hospitals; comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation
> facilities; and outpatient rehabilitation facilities. The physical
> therapy necessary to perform this training must be part of a
> one-on-one training program.
>
> Additional therapy after the purchase of the DME would be limited by
> our general policies in converge of skilled physical therapy.
>
> (Also reference the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15,

# - Supplies Used in the Delivery of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)

### (Rev. 173, Issued: 09-04-14, Effective: Upon Implementation: of ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and/or
> Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) can ordinarily be
> delivered to patients through the use of conventional electrodes,
> adhesive tapes and lead wires. There may be times, however, where it
> might be medically necessary for certain patients receiving TENS or
> NMES treatment to use, as an alternative to conventional electrodes,
> adhesive tapes and lead wires, a form-fitting conductive garment
> (i.e., a garment with conductive fibers which are separated from the
> patients' skin by layers of fabric).
>
> A form-fitting conductive garment (and medically necessary related
> supplies) may be covered under the program only when:

1.  It has received permission or approval for marketing by the Food and
    Drug Administration;

2.  It has been prescribed by a physician for use in delivering covered
    TENS or NMES treatment; and

3.  One of the medical indications outlined below is met:

    -   The patient cannot manage without the conductive garment because
        > there is such a large area or so many sites to be stimulated
        > and the stimulation would have to be delivered so frequently
        > that it is not feasible to use conventional electrodes,
        > adhesive tapes and lead wires;

    -   The patient cannot manage without the conductive garment for the
        > treatment of chronic intractable pain because the areas or
        > sites to be stimulated are inaccessible with the use of
        > conventional electrodes, adhesive tapes and lead wires;

    -   The patient has a documented medical condition such as skin
        > problems that preclude the application of conventional
        > electrodes, adhesive tapes and lead wires;

    -   The patient requires electrical stimulation beneath a cast
        > either to treat disuse atrophy, where the nerve supply to the
        > muscle is intact, or to treat chronic intractable pain; or

    -   The patient has a medical need for rehabilitation strengthening
        > (pursuant to a written plan of rehabilitation) following an
        > injury where the nerve supply to the muscle is intact.

> A conductive garment is not covered for use with a TENS device during
> the trial period specified in §160.3 unless:

4.  The patient has a documented skin problem prior to the start of the
    > trial period; and

5.  The A/B MAC (B)\'s medical consultants are satisfied that use of
    > such an item is medically necessary for the patient.

> (See conditions for coverage of the use of TENS in the diagnosis and
> treatment of chronic intractable pain in §§160.3, 160.13, and 160.27,
> and the use of NMES in the treatment of disuse atrophy in §150.4.)

# - Invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitoring

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-62**
>
> Invasive intracranial pressure monitoring is a safe and effective
> therapeutic tool used to monitor intracranial pressure. It is usually
> used for patients suffering from head injuries, subarachnoid
> hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, Reye's syndrome, or posthypoxic,
> metabolic, and viral encephalopathies. It is usually performed in
> specialized intensive care units for neurosurgical and neurologic
> patients. It is a covered procedure when reasonable and necessary for
> the individual patient.

# - Electrotherapy for Treatment of Facial Nerve Palsy (Bell's Palsy)

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-72**

### Not Covered

> Electrotherapy for the treatment of facial nerve paralysis is the
> application of electrical stimulation to affected facial muscles to
> provide muscle innervation with the intention of preventing muscle
> degeneration. A device that generates an electrical current with
> controlled frequency, intensity, wave form and type (galvanic or
> faradic) is used in combination with a pad electrode and a hand
> applicator electrode to provide electrical stimulation.
>
> Electrotherapy for the treatment of facial nerve paralysis, commonly
> known as Bell's Palsy, is not covered under Medicare because its
> clinical effectiveness has not been established.

# - Vertebral Axial Decompression (VAX-D)

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 35-97**

### Not Covered

> Vertebral axial decompression is performed for symptomatic relief of
> pain associated with lumbar disk problems. The treatment combines
> pelvic and/or cervical traction connected to a special table that
> permits the traction application. There is insufficient scientific
> data to support the benefits of this technique. Therefore, VAX-D is
> not covered by Medicare.

# - L-Dopa

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 45-1**

### Part A Payment for L-Dopa and Associated Inpatient Hospital Service

> A hospital stay and related ancillary services for the administration
> of L-Dopa are covered if medically required for this purpose. Whether
> a drug represents an allowable inpatient hospital cost during such
> stay depends on whether it meets the definition of a drug in
> [[§1861(t)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of the
> Act; i.e., on its inclusion in the compendia named in the Act or
> approval by the hospital's pharmacy and drug therapeutics (P&DT) or
> equivalent committee. (Levodopa (L-Dopa) has been favorably evaluated
> for the treatment of Parkinsonism by A.M.A. Drug Evaluations, First
> Edition 1971, the replacement compendia for "New Drugs.\")
>
> Inpatient hospital services are frequently not required in many cases
> when L-Dopa therapy is initiated. Therefore, determine the medical
> need for inpatient hospital services on the basis of medical facts in
> the individual case. It is not necessary to hospitalize the typical,
> well-functioning, ambulatory Parkinsonian patient who has no
> concurrent disease at the start of L-Dopa treatment. It is reasonable
> to provide inpatient hospital services for Parkinsonian patients with
> concurrent diseases, particularly of the cardiovascular,
> gastrointestinal, and neuropsychiatric systems. Although many patients
> require hospitalization for a period of under two weeks, a 4-week
> period of inpatient care is not unreasonable.
>
> Laboratory tests in connection with the administration of L-Dopa - The
> tests medically warranted in connection with the achievement of
> optimal dosage and the control of the side effects of L-Dopa include a
> complete blood count, liver function tests such as SGOT, SGPT, and/or
> alkaline phosphatase, BUN or creatinine and urinalysis, blood sugar,
> and electrocardiogram.
>
> Whether or not the patient is hospitalized, laboratory tests in
> certain cases are reasonable at weekly intervals although some
> physicians prefer to perform the tests much less frequently.
>
> Physical therapy furnished in connection with administration of
> L-Dopa - Where, following administration of the drug, the patient
> experiences a reduction of rigidity which permits the reestablishment
> of a restorative goal for him/her, physical therapy services required
> to enable him/her to achieve this goal are payable provided they
> require the skills of a qualified physical therapist and are furnished
> by or under the supervision of such a therapist. However, once the
> individual's restoration potential has been achieved, the services
> required to maintain him/her at this level do not generally require
> the skills of a qualified physical therapist. In such situations, the
> role of the therapist is to evaluate the patient's needs in
> consultation with his/her physician and design a program of exercise
> appropriate to the capacity and tolerance of the patient and treatment
> objectives of the physician, leaving to others the actual carrying out
> of the program. While the evaluative services rendered by a qualified
> physical therapist are payable as physical therapy, services furnished
> by others in connection with the carrying out of the maintenance
> program established by the therapist are not. (See the Medicare
> Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 1, "Inpatient Hospital Services," §30.)

### Part A Reimbursement for L-Dopa Therapy in SNFs

> Initiation of L-Dopa therapy can be appropriately carried out in the
> skilled nursing facility (SNF) setting, applying the same guidelines
> used for initiation of L-Dopa therapy in the hospital, including the
> types of patients who should be covered for inpatient services, the
> role of physical therapy, and the use of laboratory tests. (See
> subsection A.)
>
> Where inpatient care is required and L-Dopa therapy is initiated in
> the SNF, limit the stay to a maximum of four weeks; but in many cases
> the need may be no longer than one or two weeks, depending upon the
> patient's condition. However, where L-Dopa therapy is begun in the
> hospital and the patient is transferred to a SNF for continuation of
> the therapy, a combined length of stay in hospital and SNF of no
> longer than four weeks is reasonable (i.e., 1-week hospital stay
> followed by three weeks SNF stay; or two weeks hospital stay followed
> by two weeks SNF stay; etc.). Medical need must be demonstrated in
> cases where the combined length of stay in hospital and SNF is longer
> than four weeks. The choice of hospital or SNF, and the decision
> regarding the relative length of time spent in each, should be left to
> the medical judgment of the treating physician. See the Medicare
> Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 8, "Coverage of Extended Care (SNF)
> Services Under Hospital Insurance," §50.5.

### L-Dopa Coverage Under Part B

> Part B reimbursement may not be made for the drug L-Dopa since it is a
> self- administrable drug. (See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual,
> Chapter 6, "Hospital Services Covered Under Part B," §20.4.1.)
> However, physician services rendered in connection with its
> administration and control of its side effects are covered if
> determined to be reasonable and necessary. Initiation of L-Dopa
> therapy on an outpatient basis is possible in most cases. Visit
> frequency ranging from every week to every 2 or 3 months is
> acceptable. However, after half a year of therapy, visits more
> frequent than every month would usually not be reasonable.

# - Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)

> Implementation: 07-22-**
>
> **2020)**

A.  **General**

> Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is a pulse generator, similar to a
> pacemaker, that is surgically implanted under the skin of the left
> chest and an electrical lead (wire) is connected from the generator to
> the left vagus nerve. Electrical signals are sent from the
> battery-powered generator to the vagus nerve via the lead. These
> signals are in turn sent to the brain. The Food and Drug
> Administration (FDA) approved VNS for treatment of refractory epilepsy
> in 1997 and for resistant depression in 2005.

### Nationally Covered Indications

> Effective for services performed on or after July 1, 1999, VNS is
> reasonable and necessary for patients with medically refractory
> partial onset seizures for whom surgery is not recommended or for whom
> surgery has failed.
>
> Effective for services performed on or after February 15, 2019, the
> Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will cover FDA-approved

> double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a follow-up
> duration of at least one year with the possibility of extending the
> study to a prospective longitudinal study when the CMS-approved,
> double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial has completed
> enrollment, and there are positive interim findings.
>
> Each study must be approved by CMS and as a fully-described, written
> part of its protocol, must address whether VNS improves health
> outcomes for TRD patients compared to a control group, by answering
> all of the following research questions

> below. The details of the prospective longitudinal study must be
> described in the original protocol for the double-blind, randomized,
> placebo-controlled trial. Response is defined as a ≥ 50% improvement
> in depressive symptoms from baseline, as measured by a guideline
> recommended depression scale assessment tool. Remission is defined as
> being below the threshold on a guideline recommended depression scale
> assessment tool. The following research questions must be addressed in
> a separate analysis for patients with bipolar and unipolar disease.
>
> Research Questions:

-   What is the rate of response (defined as person months of
    > response/total months of study participation)?

-   What is the rate of remission (defined as person months of

# - Phrenic Nerve Stimulator

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 65-13**
>
> The implantation of a phrenic nerve stimulator is covered for selected
> patients with partial or complete respiratory insufficiency.
>
> The phrenic nerve stimulator provides electrical stimulation of the
> patient's phrenic nerve to contract the diaphragm rhythmically and
> produce breathing in patients who have hypoventilation (a state in
> which an abnormally low amount of air enters the lungs). The device
> has been used successfully to treat hypoventilation caused by a
> variety of conditions, including respiratory paralysis resulting from
> lesions of the brain stem and cervical spinal cord and chronic
> pulmonary disease with ventilatory insufficiency. The phrenic nerve
> stimulator is intended to be an alternative to management of patients
> with respiratory insufficiency who are dependent upon the usual
> therapy of intermittent or permanent use of a mechanical ventilator as
> well as maintenance of a permanent tracheotomy stoma.
>
> However, an implanted phrenic nerve stimulator can be effective only
> if the patient has an intact phrenic nerve and diaphragm. Moreover,
> nerve injury may occur during the surgical procedure and if sufficient
> injury is incurred, the device will not prove useful to the patient.
> Consequently, it is possible for such a device to be indicated for a
> patient but, due to injury sustained during implant, fail to assist
> the patient, resulting in a return to the use of mechanical
> ventilation.

# - Transfer Factor for Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 45-17**
>
> Transfer factor is the dialysate of an extract from sensitized
> leukocytes which increases cellular immune activity in the recipient.
> It is not covered as a treatment for multiple sclerosis because its

# - Telephone Transmission of EEGs

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM - 50-39**
>
> Telephone transmission of electroencephalograms (EEGs) is covered as a
> physician's service, or as incident to a physician's service when
> reasonable and necessary for the individual patient, under appropriate
> circumstances. The service is safe, and may save time and cost in
> sending EEGs from remote areas without special competence in
>
> neurology, neurosurgery, and electroencephalography, by avoiding the
> need to transport patients to large medical centers for standard EEG
> testing.
>
> Telephone transmission of EEGs has been most helpful in the following
> clinical situations:

-   Altered consciousness, such as stuporous, semicomatose, or comatose
    > states;

-   A typical seizure variants in patients experiencing bizarre,
    > distressing symptoms as seen with "spike and wave stupor" or other
    > forms of seizure disorders;

-   Diagnosis of a suspected intracranial tumor;

-   Head injury, where a subdural hematoma may be identified;

-   Headaches during the acute phase where, for instance, in migraine
    syndrome, abnormal responses may be seen.

> Telephonically transmitted EEGs should not be used for determining
> electrical inactivity (i.e., brain death), because of unavoidable
> signal interference.

# - Sensory Nerve Conduction Threshold Tests (sNCTs) (Effective April 1, 2004)

### (Rev. 15, 06-18-04)

A.  **General**

> The sNCT is a psychophysical assessment of both central and peripheral
> nerve functions. It measures the detection threshold of accurately
> calibrated sensory stimuli. This procedure is intended to evaluate and
> quantify function in both large and small caliber fibers for the
> purpose of detecting neurologic disease. Sensory perception and
> threshold detection are dependent on the integrity of both the
> peripheral sensory apparatus and peripheral-central sensory pathways.
> In theory, an abnormality detected by this procedure may signal
> dysfunction anywhere in the sensory pathway from the receptors, the
> sensory tracts, the primary sensory cortex, to the association cortex.
>
> This procedure is different and distinct from assessment of nerve
> conduction velocity, amplitude and latency. It is also different from
> short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials.
>
> Effective October 1, 2002, CMS initially concluded that there was
> insufficient scientific or clinical evidence to consider the sNCT test
> and the device used in performing this test reasonable and necessary
> within the meaning of section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the law.
>
> Therefore, sNCT was noncovered.
>
> Effective April 1, 2004, based on a reconsideration of current
> Medicare policy for sNCT, CMS concludes that the use of any type of
> sNCT device (e.g., "current output" type device used to perform
> current perception threshold (CPT), pain perception threshold (PPT),
> or pain tolerance threshold (PTT) testing or "voltage input" type
> device used for voltage-nerve conduction threshold (v-NCT) testing) to
> diagnose sensory neuropathies or radiculopathies in Medicare
> beneficiaries is not reasonable and necessary.

### Nationally Covered Indications

> Not applicable.

### Nationally Noncovered Indications

> All uses of sNCT to diagnose sensory neuropathies or radiculopathies

# - Cavernous Nerves Electrical Stimulation with Penile Plethysmography - Effective August 24, 2006

### (Rev.61, Issued: 11-24-06, Effective: 08-24-06, Implementation: 01-08-07)

A.  **General**

> In nerve-sparing prostatic and colorectal surgical procedures, the
> assessment of the function of the cavernous nerves by direct
> application of electrical stimulation with penile plethysmography is a
> diagnostic test, also referred to as cavernosal nerve mapping, which
> may be performed to assess the integrity of the cavernous nerves.
> Through an open or laparoscopic procedure, the surgeon may want to
> assess the function of the cavernous nerves by stimulating the most
> distal end of the nerve that can be located by using an electrical
> nerve stimulator. The presence of a response and the degree of the

### (Rev. 149, Issued: 11-30-12, Effective: 06-08-12, Implementation: 01-07-13)

> The TENS is a type of electrical nerve stimulator that is employed to
> treat chronic intractable pain. This stimulator is attached to the
> surface of the patient's skin over the peripheral nerve to be
> stimulated. It may be applied in a variety of settings (in the

A.  General

> For the purposes of this decision chronic low back pain (CLBP) is
> defined as:

1.  an episode of low back pain that has persisted for three months or
    > longer; and

2.  is not a manifestation of a clearly defined and generally
    > recognizable primary disease entity. For example, there are
    > cancers that, through metastatic spread to the spine or pelvis,
    > may elicit pain in the lower back as a symptom; and certain
    > systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple
