# - Speech -Language Pathology Services for the Treatment of Dysphagia

## (Rev. 55, Issued: 05-05-06, Effective: 10-01-06, Implementation: 10-02-06)

> Dysphagia is a swallowing disorder that may be due to various
> neurological, structural, and cognitive deficits. Dysphagia may be the
> result of head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, neuromuscular
> degenerative diseases, head and neck cancer, or encephalopathies.
> While dysphagia can afflict any age group, it most often appears among
> the elderly. Speech-language pathology services are covered under
> Medicare for the treatment of dysphagia, regardless of the presence of
> a communication disability.
>
> Patients who are motivated, moderately alert, and have some degree of
> deglutition and swallowing functions are appropriate candidates for
> dysphagia therapy. Elements of the therapy program can include thermal
> stimulation to heighten the sensitivity of the swallowing reflex,
> exercises to improve oral-motor control, training in laryngeal
> adduction and compensatory swallowing techniques, and positioning and
> dietary modifications. Design all programs to ensure swallowing safety
> of the patient during oral feedings and maintain adequate nutrition.

# - Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT)

## (Rev. 11426; Issued: 05-20-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 07-05-22)

A.  General

> Section
> [[1861(s)(2)(V)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Social Security Act authorizes Medicare part B coverage of medical
> nutrition therapy services (MNT) for certain beneficiaries who have
> diabetes or a renal disease. Regulations for MNT were established on
> January 2, 2002, at [[42 CFR 410.130 -
> 410.134]{.underline}.](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) This
> national coverage determination (NCD) establishes the duration and
> frequency limits for the MNT benefit and coordinates MNT and diabetes
> outpatient self-management training (DSMT) as an NCD.

B.  Nationally Covered

> Effective January 1, 2022, basic coverage of MNT, for the first year a
> beneficiary receives MNT, with either a diagnosis of renal disease or
> diabetes as defined at
>
> [[42 CFR 410.130]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) is
> three hours of administration. Basic coverage in subsequent years for
> renal disease or diabetes is two hours. The dietitian/nutritionist may

> many units are administered per day as long as all of the other
> requirements in this NCD and [[42 CFR
> 410.130-410.134]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) are

> 4CFR]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/)
> [[410.132(b)(5)]{.underline},](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/)
> additional hours are considered to be medically necessary and covered
> if the physician determines that there is a change in medical
> condition, diagnosis, or treatment regimen that requires a change in
> MNT and orders additional hours during that episode of care.
>
> If the physician determines that receipt of both MNT and DSMT is
> medically necessary in the same episode of care, Medicare will cover
> both DSMT and MNT initial and subsequent years without decreasing
> either benefit as long as DSMT and MNT are not provided on the same
> date of service. The dietitian/nutritionist may choose how many units
> are performed per day as long as all of the other requirements in the

# - Enteral and Parenteral Nutritional Therapy *(RETIRED)*

### *(Rev. 11892; Issued: 03-09-23; Effective: 04-10-23; Implementation:04-10-23)*

> Effective January 1, 2022, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
> Services determined that no national coverage determination (NCD) is
> appropriate at this time for Enteral and Parenteral Nutritional
> Therapy. In the absence of an NCD, coverage determinations

> will be made by the Medicare Administrative Contractors under
> 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act.

# - Pathology and Laboratory

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**

# - Histocompatibility Testing

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 50-23**
>
> Histocompatibility testing involves the matching or typing of the
> human leucocyte antigen (HLA). This testing is safe and effective when
> it is performed on patients:

-   In preparation for a kidney transplant;

-   In preparation for bone marrow transplantation;

-   In preparation for blood platelet transfusions (particularly where
    multiple infusions are involved); or

-   Who are suspected of having ankylosing spondylitis.

> This testing is covered under Medicare when used for any of the
> indications listed in A, B, and C and if it is reasonable and
> necessary for the patient.
>
> It is covered for ankylosing spondylitis in cases where other methods
> of diagnosis would not be appropriate or have yielded inconclusive
> results. Request documentation supporting the medical necessity of the
> test from the physician in all cases where ankylosing spondylitis is
> indicated as the reason for the test.

# - Diagnostic Pap Smears

> **(Rev. 48, Issued: 03-17-06; Effective/Implementation Dates:
> 06-19-06)**
>
> **CIM 50-20, CIM 50-20.1**
>
> A diagnostic pap smear and related medically necessary services are
> covered under Medicare Part B when ordered by a physician under one of
> the following conditions:

-   Previous 4cancer of the cervix, uterus, or vagina that has been or
    is presently being treated;

-   Previous abnormal pap smear;

-   Any abnormal findings of the vagina, cervix, uterus, ovaries, or
    > adnexa;

-   Any significant complaint by the patient referable to the female
    reproductive system; or

-   Any signs or symptoms that might in the physician's judgment
    reasonably be related to a gynecologic disorder.

> Screening Pap Smears and Pelvic Examinations for Early Detection of
> Cervical or Vaginal Cancer. (See section 210.2.)

# - Cytogenetic Studies

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 50-29**
>
> The term cytogenetic studies is used to describe the microscopic
> examination of the physical appearance of human chromosomes. Medicare

> Effective December 18, 2014, NCD 190.4 is *retired.*

# - Sweat Test

> **CIM 50-35**
>
> The sweat test is an important diagnostic tool in cystic fibrosis and
> may be covered when used for that purpose. Usage of the sweat test as

> disease is unproven and, therefore, is not covered.

# - Hair Analysis

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 50-24**
>
> Not Covered
>
> Hair analysis to detect mineral traces as an aid in diagnosing human
> disease is not a covered service under Medicare.
>
> The correlation of hair analysis to the chemical state of the whole
> body is not possible at this time, and therefore this diagnostic
> procedure cannot be considered to be reasonable and necessary under
> [[§1862(a)(1)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Act.

# - Human Tumor Stem Cell Drug Sensitivity Assays

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 50-41**
>
> Human tumor stem cell drug sensitivity assays involve exposure of
> human tumor stem cell colonies grown in tissue culture to anticancer
> drugs and observing for cytotoxic effects. Their purpose is to screen
> potential anticancer drugs and predict the effects of these drugs on
> tumors of individual patients, to allow the selection of the most
> effective drug or drugs for that patient. Human tumor drug sensitivity
> assays are considered experimental, and therefore, not covered under
> Medicare at this time.
>
> The Fluorescent Cytoprint Assay, a miniaturized organ culture system
> for cancer chemosensitivity testing, allows for qualitative visual
> estimation of cell kill using low power microscopy and a noncytotoxic
> fluoresence probe for cell viability. The clinical application of the
> assay, based on testing in tumor microorgans rather than in clones
> derived from single cells, is considered experimental, and therefore,
> not covered under Medicare at this time.

# - Lymphocyte Mitogen Response Assays

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 50-45**
>
> For Services Performed On or After May 16, 1983
>
> The lymphocyte mitogen response assay measures the immune response of
> patient peripheral blood lymphocytes. It is a covered test under
> Medicare when it is medically necessary to assess lymphocytic function
> in diagnosed in munodeficiency diseases and to monitor immunotherapy.
>
> It is not covered when it is used to monitor the treatment of cancer,
> because its use for that purpose is experimental.

# - Serologic Testing for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 50-52**
>
> Serologic testing is employed to detect antibodies to the AIDS virus
> which is currently identified by the term "human immunodeficiency
> virus (HIV)." The virus originally was named "human T-cell
> lymphotropic virus, type III (HTLV-III)," a term that remains in
> common usage.
>
> Antibodies may be detected by a variety of immunoassay techniques, the
> most common being an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). When
> an assay is reactive on initial testing, it should be repeated on the
> same specimen. A more specific test, (Western blot, immunofluorescent
> assay) is usually performed following repeatedly reactive ELISA
> results.
>
> These tests may be covered when performed to help determine a
> diagnosis for symptomatic patients. They are not covered when
> furnished as part of a screening program for asymptomatic persons.
>
> **NOTE:** Two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests that
> were conducted on the same specimen must both be positive before
> Medicare will cover the Western blot test.

# - Laboratory Tests - CRD Patients

> **(Rev. 1, 10-03-03)**
>
> **CIM 50-17**
>
> Laboratory tests are essential to monitor the progress of CRD
> patients. The following list and frequencies of tests constitute the
> level and types of routine laboratory tests that are covered. Bills
> for other types of tests are considered nonroutine. Routine tests at
> greater frequencies must include medical justification. Nonroutine
> tests generally are justified by the diagnosis. The routinely covered
> regimen includes the following tests:
>
> Per Dialysis

-   All hematocrit or hemoglobin and clotting time tests furnished
    incident to dialysis treatments.

> Per Week

-   Prothrombin time for patients on anticoagulant therapy, and

-   Serum Creatinine

> Per Week or Thirteen Per Quarter

-   BUN

> Monthly

-   CBC,

-   Serum Calcium,

-   Serum Chloride,

-   Serum Potassium,

-   Serum Bicarbonate,

-   Serum Phosphorous,

-   Total Protein,

-   Serum Albumin,

-   Alkaline Phospatase,

-   AST,

-   SGOT, and

-   LDH.

> Guidelines for tests other than those routinely performed include:

-   Serum Aluminum - one every 3 months, and

-   Serum Ferritin - one every 3 months

> The following tests for hepatitis B are covered when patients first
> enter a dialysis facility: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and
> Anti-HBs. Coverage of future testing in these patients depends on
> their serologic status and on whether they have been successfully
> immunized against hepatitis B virus. The following table summarizes
> the frequency of serologic surveillance for hepatitis B. Tests
> furnished according to this table do not require additional
> documentation and are paid separately because payment for maintenance
> dialysis treatments does not take them into account.

# - Home Prothrombin Time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR) Monitoring for Anticoagulation Management -- Effective March 19, 2008

## (Rev. 90, Issued: 07-25-08, Effective: 03-19-08, Implementation: 08-25-08)

A.  **General**

> Use of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) or prothrombin time
> (PT) - standard measurement for reporting the blood's clotting time) -
> allows physicians to determine the level of anticoagulation in a
> patient independent of the laboratory reagents used. The INR is the
> ratio of the patient's PT (extrinsic or tissue-factor dependent
> coagulation pathway) compared to the mean PT for a group of normal
> individuals. Maintaining patients within his/her prescribed
> therapeutic range minimizes adverse events associated with inadequate
> or excessive anticoagulation such as serious bleeding or
> thromboembolic events. Patient self-testing and self-management
> through the use of a home INR monitor may be used to improve the time
> in therapeutic rate (TTR) for select groups of patients.
>
> Increased TTR leads to improved clinical outcomes and reductions in
> thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events.
>
> Warfarin (also prescribed under other trade names, e.g., Coumadin®) is
> a self- administered, oral anticoagulant (blood thinner) medication
> that affects the vitamin K- dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX and
> X. It is widely used for various medical conditions, and has a narrow
> therapeutic index, meaning it is a drug with less than a 2- fold
> difference between median lethal dose and median effective dose. For
> this reason, since October 4, 2006, it falls under the category of a
> Food and Drug Administration (FDA) "black-box" drug whose dosage must
> be closely monitored to avoid serious complications. A PT/INR
> monitoring system is a portable testing device that includes a
> finger-stick and an FDA-cleared meter that measures the time it takes
> for a person's blood plasma to clot.

## Nationally Covered Indications

> For services furnished on or after March 19, 2008, Medicare will cover
> the use of home PT/INR monitoring for chronic, oral anticoagulation
> management for patients with mechanical heart valves, chronic atrial
> fibrillation, or venous thromboembolism (inclusive of deep venous
> thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) on warfarin. The monitor and the
> home testing must be prescribed by a treating physician as provided at
> [42]{.underline} [CFR 410.32(a),]{.underline} and all of the following
> requirements must be met:

1.  The patient must have been anticoagulated for at least 3 months
    prior to use of the home INR device; and,

2.  The patient must undergo a face-to-face educational program on
    anticoagulation management and must have demonstrated the correct
    use of the device prior to its use in the home; and,

3.  The patient continues to correctly use the device in the context of
    the management of the anticoagulation therapy following the
    initiation of home monitoring; and,

4.  Self-testing with the device should not occur more frequently than
    > once a week.

## Nationally Non-Covered Indications

> N/A

D.  ## Other

    1.  All other indications for home PT/INR monitoring not indicated
        as nationally covered above remain at local A/B MAC's
        discretion.

    2.  This national coverage determination (NCD) is distinct from, and
        makes no changes to, the PT clinical laboratory NCD at section
        190.17 of Publication 100-03 of the NCD Manual.

## (Rev. 17, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable) PM AB-02-110

> A bacterial urine culture is a laboratory procedure performed on a
> urine specimen to establish the probable etiology of a presumed
> urinary tract infection. It is common practice to do a urinalysis
> prior to a urine culture. A urine culture may also be used as part of
> the evaluation and management of another related condition. The
> procedure includes aerobic agar-based isolation of bacteria or other
> cultivable organisms present, and quantitation of types present based
> on morphologic criteria. Isolates deemed significant may be subjected
> to additional identification and susceptibility procedures as
> requested by the ordering physician. The physician's request may be
> through clearly documented and communicated laboratory protocols.
>
> Indications

1.  A patient's urinalysis is abnormal suggesting urinary tract
    infection, for example abnormal microscopic (hematuria, pyuria,
    bacteriuria); abnormal biochemical urinalysis (positive leukocyte
    esterase, nitrite, protein, blood); a Gram's stain positive for
    microorganisms; positive bacteriuria screen by a non-culture
    technique; or other significant abnormality of a urinalysis. While
    it is not essential to evaluate a urine specimen by one of these
    methods before a urine culture is performed, certain clinical
    presentations with highly suggestive signs and symptoms may lend
    themselves to an antecedent urinalysis procedure where follow-up
    culture depends upon an initial positive or abnormal test result.

2.  A patient has clinical signs and symptoms indicative of a possible
    urinary tract infection (UTI). Acute lower UTI may present with
    urgency, frequency, nocturia, dysuria, discharge or incontinence.
    These findings may also be noted in upper UTI with

> additional systemic symptoms (for example, fever, chills, lethargy);
> or pain in the costovertebral, abdominal, or pelvic areas. Signs and
> symptoms may overlap considerably with other inflammatory conditions
> of the genitourinary tract (for example, prostatitis, urethritis,
> vaginitis, or cervicitis). Elderly or immunocompromised patients, or
> patients with neurologic disorders may present atypically (for
> example, general debility, acute mental status changes, declining
> functional status).

3.  The patient is being evaluated for suspected urosepsis, fever of
    unknown origin, or other systemic manifestations of infection but
    without a known source. Signs and symptoms used to define sepsis
    have been well established.

4.  A test-of-cure is generally not indicated in an uncomplicated
    infection. However, it may be indicated if the patient is being
    evaluated for response to therapy and there is a complicating
    co-existing urinary abnormality including structural or functional
    abnormalities, calculi, foreign bodies, or ureteral/renal stents or
    there is clinical or laboratory evidence of failure to respond as
    described in Indications 1 and 2.

5.  In surgical procedures involving major manipulations of the
    genitourinary tract, preoperative examination to detect occult
    infection may be indicated in selected cases (for example, prior to
    renal transplantation, manipulation or removal of kidney stones, or
    transurethral surgery of the bladder of prostate).

6.  Urine culture may be indicated to detect occult infection in renal
    transplantation recipients on immunosuppressive therapy.

> Limitations

1.  CPT 87086 may be used one time per encounter.

2.  Colony count restrictions on coverage of CPT 87088 do not apply as
    they may be highly variable according to syndrome or other clinical
    circumstances (for example, antecedent therapy, collection time,
    degree of hydration).

3.  CPT 87088, 87184, and 87186 may be used multiple times in
    association with or independent of 87086, as urinary tract
    infections may be polymicrobial.

4.  Testing for asymptomatic bacteriuria as part of a prenatal
    evaluation may be medically appropriate but is considered screening
    and therefore not covered by Medicare. The U.S. Preventive Services
    Task Force has concluded that screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria
    outside of the narrow indication for pregnant women is generally not
    indicated. There are insufficient data to recommend screening in
    ambulatory elderly patients including those with diabetes. Testing
    may be clinically indicated on other grounds including likelihood of
    recurrence or potential adverse effects of antibiotics, but is
    considered screening in the absence of clinical or laboratory
    evidence of infection.

    1.  # - Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Testing (Prognosis Including Monitoring)

## (Rev. 17, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable) PM AB-02-110

> HIV quantification is achieved through the use of a number of
> different assays, which measure the amount of circulating viral RNA.
> Assays vary both in methods used to detect viral RNA as well as in
> ability to detect viral levels at lower limits. However, all employ
> some type of nucleic acid amplification technique to enhance
> sensitivity, and results are expressed as the HIV copy number.
>
> Quantification assays of HIV plasma RNA are used prognostically to
> assess relative risk for disease progression and predict time to
> death, as well as to assess efficacy of antiretroviral therapies over
> time.
>
> The HIV quantification is often performed together with CD4+ T cell
> counts, which provide information on extent of HIV induced immune
> system damage already incurred.
>
> Indications

1.  A plasma HIV RNA baseline level may be medically necessary in any
    patient with confirmed HIV infection.

2.  Regular periodic measurement of plasma HIV RNA levels may be
    medically necessary to determine risk for disease progression in an
    HIV-infected individual and to determine when to initiate
    antiretroviral treatment regimens.

3.  In clinical situations where the risk of HIV infection is
    significant and initiation of therapy is anticipated, a baseline HIV
    quantification may be performed. These situation include:

    a.  Persistence of borderline or equivocal serologic reactivity in
        an at-risk individual.

    b.  Signs and symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome characterized by
        fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy and rash in an at-risk
        individual

> Limitations

1.  Viral quantification may be appropriate for prognostic use including
    baseline determination, periodic monitoring and monitoring of
    response to therapy. Use as a diagnostic test method is not
    indicated.

2.  Measurement of plasma HIV RNA levels should be performed at the time
    of establishment of an HIV infection diagnosis. For an accurate
    baseline, 2 specimens in a 2-week period are appropriate.

3.  For prognosis including anti-retroviral therapy monitoring, regular,
    periodic measurements are appropriate. The frequency of viral load
    testing should be consistent with the most current Centers for
    Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for use of antiretroviral
    agents in adults and adolescents or pediatrics.

4.  Because differences in absolute HIV copy number are known to occur
    using different assays, plasma HIV RNA levels should be measured by
    the same analytical method. A change in assay method may necessitate
    re-establishment of a baseline.

5.  Nucleic acid quantification techniques are representative of rapidly
    emerging and evolving new technologies. As such, users are advised
    to remain current of FDA- approved status.

    1.  # - Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Testing (Diagnosis)

## (Rev. 131, Issued: 02-23-11, Effective: 12-08-09, Implementation: 07-06-10)

> Diagnosis of HIV infection is primarily made through the use of
> serologic assays. These assays take one of two forms: antibody
> detection assays and specific HIV antigen (p24) procedures. The
> antibody assays are usually enzyme immunoassays (EIA), which are used
> to confirm exposure of an individual's immune system to specific viral
> antigens.
>
> These assays may be formatted to detect HIV-1, HIV-2, or HIV-1 and 2
> simultaneously, and to detect both IgM and IgG. When the initial EIA
> test is repeatedly positive or indeterminant, an alternative test is
> used to confirm the specificity of the antibodies to individual viral
> components. The most commonly used method is the Western Blot.
>
> The HIV-1 core antigen (p24) test detects circulating viral antigen
> which may be found prior to the development of antibodies and may also
> be present in later stages of illness in the form of recurrent or
> persistent antigenemia. Its prognostic utility in HIV infection has
> been diminished as a result of development of sensitive viral RNA
> assays, and its primary use today is as a routine screening tool in
> potential blood donors.
>
> In several unique situations, serologic testing alone may not reliably
> establish an HIV infection. This may occur because the antibody
> response (particularly the IgG response detected by Western Blot) has
> not yet developed (that is, acute retroviral syndrome) or is
> persistently equivocal because of inherent viral antigen variability.
> It is also an issue in perinatal HIV infection due to transplacental
> passage of maternal HIV antibody. In these situations, laboratory
> evidence of HIV in blood by culture, antigen assays, or proviral DNA
> or viral RNA assays, is required to establish a definitive
> determination of HIV infection.
>
> Indications
>
> Diagnostic testing to establish HIV infection may be indicated when
> there is a strong clinical suspicion supported by one or more of the
> following clinical findings:

1.  The patient has a documented, otherwise unexplained, AIDS-defining
    or AIDS- associated opportunistic infection.

2.  The patient has another documented sexually transmitted disease,
    which identifies significant risk of exposure to HIV and the
    potential for an early or subclinical infection.

3.  The patient has documented acute or chronic hepatitis B or C
    infection that identifies a significant risk of exposure to HIV and
    the potential for an early or subclinical infection.

4.  The patient has a documented AIDS-defining or AIDS-associated
    neoplasm.

5.  The patient has a documented AIDS-associated neurologic disorder or
    otherwise unexplained dementia.

6.  The patient has another documented AIDS-defining clinical condition,
    or a history of other severe, recurrent, or persistent conditions
    which suggest an underlying immune deficiency (for example,
    cutaneous or mucosal disorders).

7.  The patient has otherwise unexplained generalized signs and symptoms
    suggestive of a chronic process with an underlying immune deficiency
    (for example, fever, weight loss, malaise, fatigue, chronic
    diarrhea, failure to thrive, chronic cough, hemoptysis, shortness of
    breath, or lymphadenopathy).

8.  The patient has otherwise unexplained laboratory evidence of a
    chronic disease process with an underlying immune deficiency (for
    example, anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, lymphopenia, or low CD4+
    lymphocyte count).

9.  The patient has signs and symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome with
    fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, and skin rash.

10. The patient has documented exposure to blood or body fluids known to
    be capable of transmitting HIV (for example, needle sticks and other
    significant blood exposures) and antiviral therapy is initiated or
    anticipated to be initiated.

11. The patient is undergoing treatment for rape. (HIV testing is part
    of the rape treatment protocol.)

## Limitations

1.  HIV antibody testing in the United States is usually performed using
    HIV-1 or HIV- 1/2 combination tests. HIV-2 testing is indicated if
    clinical circumstances suggest HIV-2 is likely (that is, compatible
    clinical finding and HIV-1 test negative). HIV-2 testing may also be
    indicated in areas of the country where there is greater prevalence
    of HIV-2 infections.

2.  The Western Blot test should be performed only after documentation
    that the initial EIA tests are repeatedly positive or equivocal on a
    single sample.

3.  The HIV antigen tests currently have no defined diagnostic usage.

4.  Direct viral RNA detection may be performed in those situations
    where serologic testing does not establish a diagnosis but strong
    clinical suspicion persists (for example, acute retroviral syndrome,
    nonspecific serologic evidence of HIV, or perinatal HIV infection).

5.  If initial serologic tests confirm an HIV infection, repeat testing
    is not indicated.

6.  If initial serologic tests are HIV EIA negative and there is no
    indication for confirmation of infection by viral RNA detection, the
    interval prior to retesting is 3-6 months.

7.  Testing for evidence of HIV infection using serologic methods may be
    medically appropriate in situations where there is a risk of
    exposure to HIV.

8.  The CPT Editorial Panel has issued a number of codes for infectious
    agent detection by direct antigen or nucleic acid probe techniques
    that have not yet been developed or are only being used on an
    investigational basis. Laboratory providers are advised to remain
    current on FDA-approved status for these tests.

    1.  # - Blood Counts

## (Rev. 17, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable) PM AB-02-110

> Blood counts are used to evaluate and diagnose diseases relating to
> abnormalities of the blood or bone marrow. These include primary
> disorders such as anemia, leukemia, polycythemia, thrombocytosis and
> thrombocytopenia. Many other conditions secondarily affect the blood
> or bone marrow, including reaction to inflammation and infections,
> coagulopathies, neoplasms and exposure to toxic substances. Many
> treatments and therapies affect the blood or bone marrow, and blood
> counts may be used to monitor treatment effects.
>
> The complete blood count (CBC) includes a hemogram and differential
> white blood count (WBC). The hemogram includes enumeration of red
> blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, as well as the
> determination of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and indices.
>
> The symptoms of hematological disorders are often nonspecific, and are
> commonly encountered in patients who may or may not prove to have a
> disorder of the blood or bone marrow. Furthermore, many medical
> conditions that are not primarily due to abnormalities of blood or
> bone marrow may have hematological manifestations that result from the
> disease or its treatment. As a result, the CBC is one of the most
> commonly indicated laboratory tests.
>
> Inpatients with possible hematological abnormalities, it may be
> necessary to determine the hemoglobin and hematocrit, to calculate the
> red cell indices, and to measure the concentration of white blood
> cells and platelets. These measurements are usually performed on a
> multichannel analyzer that measures all of the parameters on every
> sample. Therefore, laboratory assessments routinely include these
> measurements.

## Indications

> Indications for a CBC or hemogram include red cell, platelet, and
> white cell disorders. Examples of these indications are enumerated
> individually below.

1.  Indications for a CBC generally include the evaluation of bone
    marrow dysfunction as a result of neoplasms, therapeutic agents,
    exposure to toxic substances, or pregnancy. The CBC is also useful
    in assessing peripheral destruction of blood cells, suspected bone
    marrow failure or bone marrow infiltrate, suspected
    myeloproliferative, myelodysplastic, or lymphoproliferative
    processes, and immune disorders.

2.  Indications for hemogram or CBC related to red cell (RBC) parameters
    of the hemogram include signs, symptoms, test results, illness, or
    disease that can be associated with anemia or other red blood cell
    disorder (e.g., pallor, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, bleeding,
    acute injury associated with blood loss or suspected blood loss,
    abnormal menstrual bleeding, hematuria, hematemesis, hematochezia,
    positive fecal occult blood test, malnutrition, vitamin deficiency,
    malabsorption, neuropathy, known malignancy, presence of acute or
    chronic disease that may have associated anemia, coagulation or
    hemostatic disorders, postural dizziness, syncope, abdominal pain,
    change in bowel habits, chronic marrow hypoplasia or decreased RBC
    production, tachycardia, systolic heart murmur, congestive heart
    failure dyspnea, angina, nailbed deformities, growth retardation,
    jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lmphadenopathy, ulcers on the
    lower extremities).

3.  Indications for hemogram or CBC related to red cell (RBC) parameters
    of the hemogram include signs, symptoms test results illness, or
    disease that can be associated with polycythemia (for example,
    fever, chills, ruddy skin, conjunctival redness, cough, wheezing,
    cyanosis, clubbing of the fingers, orthopnea, heart murmur,
    headache, vague cognitive changes including memory changes, sleep
    apnea, weakness, pruritus, dizziness, excessive sweating, visual
    symptoms, weight loss, massive obesity, gastrointestinal bleeding,
    paresthesias, dyspnea, joint symptoms, epigastric distress, pain and
    erythema of the fingers or toes, venous or arterial thrombosis,
    thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic
    attacks, congenital heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
    disease, increased erythropoietin production associated with
    neoplastic, renal or hepatic disorders, androgen or diuretic use,
    splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, diastolic hypertension.)

4.  Specific indication for CBC with differential count related to the
    WBC include signs, symptoms, test results, illness, or disease
    associated with leukemia, infections or

> inflammatory processes, suspected bone marrow failure or bone marrow
> infiltrate, suspected myeloproliferative, myelodysplastic or
> lymphoproliferative disorder, use of drugs that may cause leukopenia,
> and immune disorders (e.g., fever, chills, sweats, shock, fatigue,
> malaise, tachycardia, tachypnea, heart murmur, seizures, alterations
> of consciousness, meningismus, pain such as headache, abdominal pain,
> arthralgia, odynophagia, or dysuria, redness or swelling of skin, soft
> tissue bone, or joint, ulcers or the skin or mucous membranes,
> gangrene, mucous membrane discharge, bleeding, thrombosis, respiratory
> failure, pulmonary infiltrate, jaundice, diarrhea, vomiting,
> hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, opportunistic infection
> such as oral candidiasis.)

5.  Specific indication for CBC related to the platelet count include
    signs, symptoms, test results, illness, or disease associated with
    increased or decreased platelet production and destruction, or
    platelet dysfunction (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding, genitourinary
    tract bleeding, bilateral epistaxis, thrombosis, ecchymosis,
    purpura, jaundice, petechiae, fever, heparin therapy, suspected DIC,
    shock, pre-eclampsia, neonate with maternal ITP, massive
    transfusions, recent platelet transfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass,
    hemolytic uremic syndrome, renal diseases, lymphadenopathy,
    hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, hypersplenism, neurologic abnormalities,
    viral or other infection, myeloproliferative, myelodysplastic, or
    lymphoproliferative disorder, thrombosis, exposure to toxic agents,
    excessive alcohol ingestion, autoimmune disorders (SLE, RA and
    other).

6.  Indications for hemogram or CBC related to red cell (RBC) parameters
    of the hemogram include, in addition to those already listed,
    thalassemia, suspected hemoglobinopathy, lead poisoning, arsenic
    poisoning, and spherocytosis.\]

7.  Specific indications for CBC related to differential count related
    to the WBC include, in addition to those already listed, storage
    diseases; mucopolysaccharidoses, and use of drugs that case
    leukocytosis such as G-CSF or CM-CSF.

8.  Specific indications for CBC related to platelet count include, in
    addition to those already listed, May-Hegglin syndrome and
    Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

## Limitations

1.  Testing of patients who are asymptomatic, or who do not have a
    condition that could be expected to result in a hematological
    abnormality, is screening and is not a covered service.

2.  In some circumstances it may be appropriate to perform only a
    hemoglobin or hematocrit to assess the oxygen carrying capacity of
    the blood. When the ordering provider requests only hemoglobin or
    hematocrit, the remaining components of the CBC are not covered.

3.  When a blood count is performed for an end-stage renal disease
    (ESRD) patient, and is billed outside the ESRD rate, documentation
    of the medical necessity for the blood count must be submitted with
    the claim.

4.  In some patients presenting with certain signs, symptoms, or
    diseases, a single CBC may be appropriate. Repeat testing may not be
    indicated unless abnormal results are found, or unless there is a
    change in clinical condition. If repeat testing is performed, a more
    descriptive diagnosis code (e.g., anemia) should be reported to
    support medical necessity. However, repeat testing may be indicated
    where results are normal in patients with conditions where there is
    a continued risk for the development of hematologic abnormality.

    1.  # - Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT)

## (Rev. 17, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable) PM AB-02-110

> Basic plasma coagulation function is readily assessed with a few
> simple laboratory tests: The PTT, prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time
> (TT), or a quantitative fibrinogen determination. The PTT test is an
> in vitro laboratory test used to assess the intrinsic coagulation
> pathway and monitor heparin therapy.

## Indications

1.  The PTT is most commonly used to quantitate the effect of
    therapeutic unfractionated heparin and to regulate its dosing.
    Except during transitions between heparin and warfarin therapy, in
    general both the PTT and PT are not necessary together to assess the
    effect of anticoagulation therapy. PT and PTT must be justified
    separately.

2.  A PTT may be used to assess patients with signs or symptoms of
    hemorrhage or thrombosis. For example: Abnormal bleeding, hemorrhage
    or hematoma petechiae or other signs of thrombocytopenia that could
    be dues to disseminated intravascular coagulation; swollen extremity
    with or without prior trauma.

3.  A PTT may be useful in evaluating patients who have a history of a
    condition known to be associated with the risk of hemorrhage or
    thrombosis that is related to the intrinsic coagulation pathway.
    Such abnormalities may be genetic or acquired. For example:
    dysfibrinogenemia; afibrinogenemia (complete); acute or chronic
    liver dysfunction or failure, including Wilson's disease;
    hemophilia; liver disease and failure; infectious processes;
    bleeding disorders; disseminated intravascular coagulation; lupus
    erythematosus or other conditions associated with circulating
    inhibitors e.g., factor VIII inhibitor, lupus-like anticoagulant;
    sepsis; vonWillebrand's disease; arterial and venous thrombosis,
    including the evaluation of hypercoagulable states; clinical
    conditions associated with nephrosis or renal failure; other
    acquired and congenital coagulopathies as well as thrombotic states.

4.  A PTT may be used to assess the risk of thrombosis or hemorrhage in
    patients who are going to have a medical intervention known to be
    associated with increased risk of bleeding or thrombosis. An example
    is as follows: evaluation prior to invasive procedures or operations
    of patients with personal or family history of bleeding or who are
    on heparin therapy.

## Limitations

1.  The PTT is not useful in monitoring the effects of warfarin on a
    patient's coagulation routinely. However, a PTT may be ordered on a
    patient being treated with warfarin as heparin therapy is being
    discontinued. A PTT may also be indicated when the PT is markedly
    prolonged due to warfarin toxicity.

2.  The need to repeat this test is determined by changes in the
    underlying medical condition and/or dosing of heparin.

3.  Testing prior to any medical intervention associated with a risk of
    bleeding and thrombosis (other than thrombolytic therapy) will
    generally be considered medically necessary only where there are
    signs or symptoms of a bleeding or thrombotic abnormality or a
    personal history of bleeding, thrombosis or a condition associated
    with a coagulopathy. Hospital/clinical-specific policies, protocols,
    etc., in and of themselves, cannot alone justify coverage.

    1.  # - Prothrombin Time (PT)

## (Rev. 17, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable) PM AB-02-110

> Basic plasma coagulation function is readily assessed with a few
> simple laboratory tests: the partial thromboplastin time (PTT), PT,
> thrombin time, or a quantitative fibrinogen determination. The PT test
> is one in-vitro laboratory test used to assess coagulation.
>
> While the PTT assesses the intrinsic limb of the coagulation system,
> the PT assesses the extrinsic or tissue factor dependent pathway. Both
> tests also evaluate the common coagulation pathway involving all the
> reactions that occur after the activation of factor X.
>
> Extrinsic pathway factors are produced in the liver and their
> production is dependent on adequate vitamin K activity. Deficiencies
> of factors may be related to decreased production of increased
> consumption of coagulation factors. The PR/INR is most commonly used
> to measure the effect of warfarin and regulate its dosing. Warfarin
> blocks the effect of vitamin K on hepatic production of extrinsic
> pathway factors.
>
> A PT is expressed in seconds and/or as an international normalized
> ration (INR). The INR is the PT ration that would result if the WHO
> reference thromboplastin had been used in performing the test.
>
> Current medical information does not clarify the role of laboratory PT
> testing in patients who are self monitoring. Therefore, the
> indications for testing apply regardless of whether or not the patient
> is also PT self-testing.

## Indications

1.  A PT may be used to assess patients taking warfarin. The PT is
    generally not useful in monitoring patients receiving heparin who
    are not taking warfarin.

2.  A PT may be used to assess patients with signs or symptoms of
    abnormal bleeding or thrombosis. For example: swollen extremity with
    or without prior trauma; unexplained bruising; abnormal bleeding,
    hemorrhage, or hematoma; petechiae or other signs or
    thrombocytopenia that could be due to disseminated intravascular
    coagulation.

3.  A PT may be useful in evaluating patients who have a history of a
    condition known to be associated with the risk of bleeding or
    thrombosis that is related to the extrinsic coagulation pathway.
    Such abnormalities may be genetic or acquires. For example:
    dysfibrinogenemia; afibrinogenemia (complete); acute or chronic
    liver dysfunction or failure, including Wilson's disease and
    hemochromatosis; disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC);
    congenital and acquired deficiencies of factors II, V, VII, X;
    vitamin K deficiency; lupus erythematosus; hypercoagulable state;
    paraproteinemia; lymphoma; amyloidosis; acute and chronic leukemias;
    plasma cell dyscrasia; HIV infection; malignant neoplasms;
    hemorrhagic fever; salicylate poisoning; obstructive jaundice;
    intestinal fistula; malabsorption syndrome; colitis; chronic
    diarrhea; presence of peripheral venous or arterial thrombosis or
    pulmonary emboli or myocardial infarction; patients with bleeding or
    clotting tendencies; organ transplantation; presence of circulating
    coagulation inhibitors.

4.  APT may be used to assess the risk of hemorrhage or thrombosis in
    patients who are going to have a medical intervention known to be
    associated with increased risk of bleeding or thrombosis. For
    example: evaluation prior to invasive procedures or operations of
    patients with personal history of bleeding of a condition associated
    with coagulopathy; prior to the use of thrombolytic medication.

## Limitations

1.  When an ESRD patient is tested for PT, testing more frequently than
    weekly requires documentation of medical necessity, e.g., other than
    chronic renal failure or renal failure unspecified.

2.  The need to repeat this test is determined by changes in the
    underlying medical condition and/or the dosing of warfarin. In a
    patient on stable warfarin therapy, it is ordinarily not necessary
    to repeat testing more than every two to three weeks. When testing
    is performed to evaluate a patient with signs or symptoms of
    abnormal bleeding or thrombosis and the initial test result is
    normal, it is ordinarily not necessary to repeat testing unless
    there is a change in the patient's medical status.

3.  Since the INR is a calculation, it will not be paid in addition to
    the PT when expressed in seconds, and is considered part of the
    conventional PT test.

4.  Testing prior to any medical intervention associated with a risk of
    bleeding and thrombosis (other that thrombolytic therapy) will
    generally be considered medically necessary only where there are
    signs or symptoms of a bleeding or thrombotic abnormality of a
    personal history of bleeding, thrombosis or a condition associated
    with a coagulopathy. Hospital/clinic-specific policies, protocols,
    etc., in and of themselves, cannot alone justify coverage.

## Indications

1.  Ferritin, iron and either iron binding capacity or transferrin are
    useful in the differential diagnosis or iron deficiency, anemia and
    for iron overload conditions.

    a.  The following presentations are examples that may support the
        use of these studies for elevating iron deficiency: Certain
        abnormal blood count values (i.e., decreased mean corpuscular
        volume (MCV), decreased hemoglobin/hematocrit when the MCV is
        low or normal, or increased red cell distribution with width
        (RDW) and low or normal MCV); abnormal appetite (pica); acute or
        chronic gastrointestinal blood loss; hematuria; menorrhagia;
        malabsorption; status post-gastrectomy; status port-
        gastrojejunostomy; malnutrition; preoperative autologous blood
        collection(s); malignant, chronic inflammatory and infectious
        conditions associated with anemia which may present in a similar
        manner to iron deficiency anemia; following a significant
        surgical procedure where blood loss had occurred and had not
        been repaired with adequate iron replacement.

    b.  The following presentations are example that may support the se
        of these studies for evaluating iron overload: chronic
        hepatitis; diabetes; hyperpigmentation of skin; arthropathy;
        cirrhosis; hypogonadism; hypopituitarism; impaired porphyrin
        metabolism; heart failure; multiple transfusions; sideroblastic
        anemia; thalassemia major; cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysrhythmias
        and conduction disturbances.

2.  Follow-up testing may be appropriate to monitor response to therapy,
    e.g., oral or parenteral iron, ascorbic acid, and erythropoietin.

3.  Iron studies may be appropriate in patients after treatment for
    other nutritional deficiency anemia, such as folate and vitamin B12,
    because iron deficiency may not be revealed until such a nutritional
    deficiency is treated.

4.  Serum ferritin may be appropriate for monitoring iron status in
    patients with chronic renal disease with or without dialysis.

5.  Serum iron may also be indicated for evaluation of toxic effects of
    iron and other metals (e.g., nickel, cadmium, aluminum, lead)
    whether due to accidental, intentional exposure or metabolic causes.

## Limitations

1.  Iron studies should be used to diagnose and manage iron deficiency
    or ion overload states. These tests are not to be used solely to
    assess acute phase reactants where disease management will be
    unchanged. For example, infections and malignancies are associated
    with elevations in acute phase reactants such as ferritin, and
    decreases in serum iron concentration, but iron studies would only
    be medically necessary if results or iron studies might alter the
    management of the primary diagnosis or might warrant direct
    treatment of an iron disorder or condition.

2.  If a normal serum ferritin level is documented, repeat testing would
    not ordinarily be medically necessary unless there is a change in
    the patient's condition, and ferritin assessment is needed for the
    ongoing management of the patient. For example, a patient presents
    with new onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and has a serum
    ferritin level performed for the suspicion of hemochromatosis. If
    the ferritin level is normal, the repeat ferritin for diabetes
    mellitus would not be medically necessary.

3.  When an end stage renal disease (ESRD) patient is tested for
    ferritin, testing more frequently than every three months requires
    documentation of medical necessity (e.g., other than chronic renal
    failure or renal failure, unspecified).

4.  It is ordinarily not necessary to measure both transferring and TIBC
    at the same time because TIBC is an indirect measure of transferrin.
    When transferrin is ordered as part of the nutritional assessment
    for evaluating malnutrition, it is not necessary to order other iron
    studies unless iron deficiency or iron overload is suspected as
    well.

5.  It is not ordinarily necessary to measure both iron/TIBC (or
    transferrin) and ferritin in initial patient testing. If clinically
    indicated after evaluation of the initial iron studies, it may be
    appropriate to perform additional iron studies either on the initial
    specimen of on a subsequently obtained specimen. After a diagnosis
    of iron deficiency or iron overload is established, either iron/TIBC
    (or transferring) or ferritin may be medically necessary for
    monitoring, but not both.

6.  It would not ordinarily be considered medically necessary to do a
    ferritin as a preoperative test except in the presence of anemia or
    recent autologous blood collections prior to the surgery.

    1.  # - Collagen Crosslinks, Any Method

## (Rev. 17, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable) PM AB-02-110

> Collagen crosslinks, part of the matrix of bone upon which bone
> mineral is deposited, are biochemical markers the excretion of which
> provides a quantitative measurement of bone resorption. Elevated
> levels of urinary collagen crosslinks indicate elevated bone
> resorption. Elevated bone resorption contributes to age-related and
> postmenopausal loss of bone leading to osteoporosis and increased risk
> of fracture. The collagen crosslinks assay can be performed by
> immunoassay or by high performance liquid chromatography
>
> (HPLC). Collagen crosslink immunoassays measure the pyridinoline
> crosslinks and associated telopeptides in urine.
>
> Bone is constantly undergoing a metabolic process called turnover or
> remodeling. This includes a degradation process, bone resorption,
> mediated by the action of osteoclasts, and a building process, bone
> formation, mediated by the action of osteoblasts.
>
> Remodeling is required for the maintenance and overall health of bone
> and is tightly coupled; that is, resorption and formation must be in
> balance. In abnormal states of bone remodeling, when resorption
> exceeds formation, it results in a net loss of bone. The measurement
> of specific, bone-derived resorption products provides analytical data
> about the rate of bone resorption.
>
> Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by low bone mass and
> structural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone fragility and
> an increased susceptibility to fractures of the hip, spine, and wrist.
> The term primary osteoporosis is applied where the causal factor in
> the disease is menopause or aging. The term secondary osteoporosis is
> applied where the causal factor is something other than menopause or
> aging, such as long-term administration of glucocorticosteroids,
> endocrine-related disorders (other than loss of estrogen due to
> menopause), and certain bone diseases such as cancer of the bone.
>
> With respect to quantifying bone resorption, collagen crosslink tests
> can provide adjunct diagnostic information in concert with bone mass
> measurements. Bone mass measurements and biochemical markers may have
> complementary roles to play in assessing effectiveness of osteoporosis
> treatment. Proper management of osteoporosis patients, who are on
> long-term therapeutic regimens, may include laboratory testing of
> biochemical markers of bone turnover, such as collagen crosslinks,
> that provide a profile of bone turnover responses within weeks of
> therapy. Changes in collagen crosslinks are determined following
> commencement of antiresorptive therapy. These can be measured over a
> shorter time interval, such as three months, when compared to bone
> mass density. If bone resorption is not elevated, repeat testing is
> not medically necessary.

## Indications

> Generally speaking, collagen crosslink testing is useful mostly in
> "fast losers" of bone. The age when these bone markers can help direct
> therapy is often pre-Medicare. By the time a fast loser of bone
> reaches age 65, she will most likely have been stabilized by
> appropriate therapy or have lost so much bone mass that further
> testing is useless.
>
> Coverage for bone marker assays may be established, however, for
> younger Medicare beneficiaries and for those men and women who might
> become fast losers because of some other therapy such as
> glucocorticoids. Safeguards should be incorporated to prevent
> excessive use of tests in patients for whom they have no clinical
> relevance.
>
> Collagen crosslinks testing is used to:

1.  Identify individuals with elevated bone resorption, who have
    osteoporosis in whom response to treatment is being monitored.

2.  Predict response (as assessed by bone mass measurements) to FDA
    approved antiresorptive therapy in postmenopausal women.

3.  Assess response to treatment of patients with osteoporosis, Paget's
    disease or the bone, or risk for osteoporosis where treatment may
    include FDA approved antiresorptive agents, anti-estrogens or
    selective estrogens receptor moderators.

## Limitations

> Because of significant specimen to specimen collagen crosslink
> physiologic variability (15-20 percent), current recommendations for
> appropriate utilization include: one or two base-line assays from
> specified urine collections on separate days; followed by a repeat
> assay about 3 months after starting anti-resorptive therapy; followed
> by a repeat assay in 12 months after the 3-month assay; and thereafter
> not more than annually, unless there is a change in therapy in which
> circumstance an additional test may be indicated 3 months after the
> initiation of new therapy.
>
> Some collagen crosslink assays may not be appropriate for use in some
> disorders, according to FDA labeling restrictions.

# - Blood Glucose Testing

## (Rev. 28, Issued: 02-11-05, Effective: 01-01-05, Implementation: 03-11-05)

> This policy is intended to apply to blood samples used to determine
> glucose levels. Blood glucose determination may be done using whole
> blood, serum or plasma. It may be sampled by capillary puncture, as in
> the fingerstick method, or by vein puncture or arterial sampling. The
> method for assay may be by color comparison or an indicator stick, by
> meter assay of whole blood or a filtrate of whole blood, using a
> device approved for home monitoring, or by using a laboratory assay
> system using serum or plasma. The convenience of the meter or stick
> color method allows a patient to have access to blood glucose values
> in less than a minute or so and has become a standard of care for
> control of blood glucose, even in the inpatient setting.

## Indications

> Blood glucose values are often necessary for the management of
> patients with diabetes mellitus, where hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia
> are often present. They are also critical in the determination of
> control of blood glucose levels in the patient with impaired fasting
> glucose (FPG 110-125 mg/dL), the patient with insulin resistance
> syndrome and/or carbohydrate intolerance (excessive rise in glucose
> following ingestion of glucose or glucose sources of food), in the
> patient with a hypoglycemia disorder such as nesidioblastosis or
> insulinoma, and in patients with a catabolic or malnutrition state. In
> addition to those conditions already listed, glucose testing may be
> medically necessary in patients with tuberculosis, unexplained chronic
> or recurrent infections, alcoholism,
>
> coronary artery disease (especially in women), or unexplained skin
> conditions (including pruritis, local skin infections, ulceration and
> gangrene without an established cause).
>
> Many medical conditions may be a consequence of a sustained elevated
> or depressed glucose level. These include comas, seizures or epilepsy,
> confusion, abnormal hunger, abnormal weight loss or gain, and loss of
> sensation. Evaluation of glucose may also be indicated in patients on
> medications known to affect carbohydrate metabolism.
>
> Effective January 1, 2005, the Medicare law expanded coverage to
> diabetic screening services. Some forms of blood glucose testing
> covered under this national coverage determination may be covered for
> screening purposes subject to specified frequencies. See 42 CFR 410.18
> and section 90, chapter 18, of the Claims Processing Manual, for a
> full description of this screening benefit.

## Limitations

> Frequent home blood glucose testing by diabetic patients should be
> encouraged. In stable, non-hospitalized patients who are unable or
> unwilling to do home monitoring, it may be reasonable and necessary to
> measure quantitative blood glucose up to four times annually.
>
> Depending upon the age of the patient, type of diabetes, degree of
> control, complications of diabetes, and other co-morbid conditions,
> more frequent testing than four times annually may be reasonable and
> necessary.
>
> In some patients presenting with nonspecific signs, symptoms, or
> diseases not normally associated with disturbances in glucose
> metabolism, a single blood glucose test may be medically necessary.
> Repeat testing may not be indicated unless abnormal results are found
> or unless there is a change in clinical condition. If repeat testing
> is performed, a specific diagnosis code (e.g., diabetes) should be
> reported to support medical necessity. However, repeat testing may be
> indicated where results are normal in patients with conditions where
> there is a confirmed continuing risk of glucose metabolism abnormality
> (e.g., monitoring glucocorticoid therapy).

# - Glycated Hemoglobin/Glycated Protein

## (Rev. 17, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable) PM AB-02-110

> The management of diabetes mellitus requires regular determinations of
> blood glucose levels. Glycated hemoglobin/protein levels are used to
> assess long-term glucose control in diabetes. Alternative names for
> these tests include glycated or glycosylated hemoglobin or Hgb,
> hemoglobin glycated or glycosylated protein, and fructosamine.
>
> Glycated hemoglobin (equivalent to hemoglobin A1) refers to total
> glycosylated hemoglobin present in erythrocytes, usually determined by
> affinity or ion-exchange chromatographic methodology. Hemoglobin A1c
> refers to the major component of
>
> hemoglobin A1, usually determined by ion-exchange affinity
> chromatography, immunoassay or agar gel electrophoresis. Fructosamine
> or glycated protein refers to glycosylated protein present in a serum
> or plasma sample. Glycated protein refers to measurement of the
> component of the specific protein that is glycated usually by
> colorimetric method or affinity chromatography.
>
> Glycated hemoglobin in whole blood assesses glycemic control over a
> period of 4-8 weeks and appears to be the more appropriate test for
> monitoring a patient who is capable of maintaining long-term, stable
> control. Measurement may be medically necessary every 3 months to
> determine whether a patient's metabolic control has been on average
> within the target range. More frequent assessment, every 1-2 months,
> may be appropriate in the patient whose diabetes regimen has been
> altered to improve control or in whom evidence is present that
> intercurrent events may have altered a previously satisfactory level
> of control (for example, post-major surgery or a s a result of
> glucocorticoid therapy). Glycated protein in serum/plasma assesses
> glycemic control over a period of 1- 2 weeks. It may be reasonable and
> necessary to monitor glycated protein monthly in pregnant diabetic
> women. Glycated hemoglobin/protein test results may be low, indicating
> significant, persistent hypoglycemia, in nesidioblastosis or
> insulinoma, conditions which are accompanied by inappropriate
> hyperinsulinemia. A below normal test value is helpful in establishing
> the patient's hypoglycemic state in those conditions.

## Indications

> Glycated hemoglobin/protein testing is widely accepted as medically
> necessary for the management and control of diabetes. It is also
> valuable to assess hyperglycemia, a history of hyperglycemia or
> dangerous hypoglycemia. Glycated protein testing may be used in place
> of glycated hemoglobin in the management of diabetic patients, and is
> particularly useful in patients who have abnormalities of erythrocytes
> such as hemolytic anemia or hemoglobinopathies.

## Limitations

> It is not considered reasonable and necessary to perform glycated
> hemoglobin tests more often than every 3 months on a controlled
> diabetic patient to determine whether the patient's metabolic control
> has been on average within the target range. It is not considered
> reasonable and necessary for these tests to be performed more
> frequently than once a month for diabetic pregnant women. Testing for
> uncontrolled type one or two diabetes mellitus may require testing
> more than four times a year. The above section provides the clinical
> basis for those situations in which testing more frequently than four
> times per annum is indicated, and medically necessary documentation
> must support such testing in excess of the above guidelines.
>
> Many methods for the analysis of glycated hemoglobin show significant
> interference from elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin or by variant
> hemoglobin molecules. When the glycated hemoglobin assay is initially
> performed in these patients, the laboratory may inform the ordering
> physician of a possible analytical interference. Alternative testing,
>
> including glycated protein, for example, fructosamine, may be
> indicated for the monitoring of the degree of glycemic control in this
> situation. It is therefore conceivable that a patient will have both a
> glycated hemoglobin and glycated protein ordered on the same day. This
> should be limited to the initial assay of glycated hemoglobin, with
> subsequent exclusive use of glycated protein. These tests are not
> considered to be medically necessary for the diagnosis of diabetes.

# - Thyroid Testing

## (Rev. 17, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable) PM AB-02-110

>
> Laboratory evaluation of thyroid function has become more

> thereby reducing the number of tests needed to diagnose and follow
> treatment of most thyroid disease. Measurements of serum sensitive
> thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, complemented by
> determination of thyroid hormone levels \[free thyroxine (fT-4) or
> total thyroxine (T4) with Triiodothyronine (T3) uptake\] are used for
> diagnosis and follow-up of patients with thyroid disorders.
>
> Additional tests may be necessary to evaluate certain complex
> diagnostic problems or on hospitalized patients, where many
> circumstances can skew tests results. When a test for total thyroxine
> (total T4 or T4 radioimmunoassay) or T3 uptake is performed,
> calculation of the free thyroxine index (FTI) is useful to correct for
> abnormal results for either total T4 or T3 uptake due to protein
> binding effects.

## Indications

> Thyroid function tests are used to define hyper function,
> euthyroidism, or hypofunction of thyroid disease. Thyroid testing may
> be reasonable and necessary to:

-   Distinguish between primary and secondary hypothyroidism

-   Confirm or rule our primary hypothyroidism

-   Monitor thyroid hormone levels (for example, patients with goiter,
    thyroid nodules, or thyroid cancer)

-   Monitor dug therapy in patients with primary hypothyroidism

-   Confirm or rule out primary hyperthyroidism

-   Monitor therapy in patients with hyperthyroidism

> Thyroid function testing may be medically necessary in patients with
> disease or neoplasm of the thyroid and other endocrine glands. Thyroid
> function testing may also be medically necessary in patients with
> metabolic disorders; malnutrition; hyperlipidemia; certain types of
> anemia; psychosis and non-psychotic personality disorders; unexplained

> cardiovascular; and gastrointestinal system.
>
> It may be medically necessary to do follow-up thyroid testing in
> patients with a personal history of malignant neoplasm of the
> endocrine system and in patients on long-term thyroid drug therapy.

## Limitations

> Testing may be covered up to two times a year in clinically stable

# - Lipid Testing

## (Rev. 28, Issued: 02-11-05, Effective: 01-01-05, Implementation: 03-11-05)

> Lipoproteins are a class of heterogeneous particles of varying sizes
> and densities containing lipid and protein. These lipoproteins include
> cholesterol esters and free cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids
> and A, C, and E apoproteins. Total cholesterol comprises all the
> cholesterol found in various lipoproteins.
>
> Factors that affect blood cholesterol levels include age, sex, body
> weight, diet, alcohol and tobacco use, exercise, genetic factors,
> family history, medications, menopausal status, the use of hormone
> replacement therapy, and chronic disorders such as hypothyroidism,
> obstructive liver disease, pancreatic disease (including diabetes),
> and kidney disease.
>
> In many individuals, an elevated blood cholesterol level constitutes
> an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease. Blood levels
> of total cholesterol and various fractions of cholesterol, especially
> low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high density
> lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), are useful in assessing and
> monitoring treatment for that risk in patients with cardiovascular and
> related diseases. Blood levels of the above cholesterol components
> including triglyceride have been separated into desirable, borderline
> and high-risk categories by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
> Institute in their report in 1993. These categories form a useful
> basis for evaluation and treatment of patients with hyperlipidemia.
> Therapy to reduce these risk parameters includes diet, exercise and
> medications, and fat weight loss, which is particularly powerful when
> combined with diet and exercise.

## Indications

> The medical community recognizes lipid testing as appropriate for
> evaluating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conditions in which
> lipid testing may be indicated include:

-   Assessment of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease

-   Evaluation of primary dyslipidemia

-   Any form of atherosclerotic disease, or any disease leading to the
    formation of atherosclerotic disease

-   Diagnostic evaluation of diseases associated with altered lipid
    metabolism, such as: nephrotic syndrome, pancreatitis, hepatic
    disease, and hypo and hyperthyroidism

-   Secondary dyslipidemia, including diabetes mellitus, disorders of
    gastrointestinal absorption, chronic renal failure

-   Signs or symptoms of dyslipidemias, such as skin lesions

-   As follow-up to the initial screen for coronary heart disease (total
    cholesterol + HDL cholesterol) when total cholesterol is determined
    to be high (\>240 mg/dL), or borderline-high (200-140 mg/dL) plus
    two or more coronary heart disease risk factors, or an HDL
    cholesterol, \<35 mg/dL.

> To monitor the progress of patients on anti-lipid dietary management

# - Tumor Antigen by Immunoassay - CA 125

## (Rev. 47, Issued: 02-24-06, Effective: 01-01-06, Implementation: 01-03-06)

> Immunoassay determinations of the serum levels of certain proteins or

>
> This policy specifically addresses tumor antigen CA 125.

## Indications

> The CA 125 is a high molecular weight serum tumor marker elevated in
> 80 percent of patients who present with epithelial ovarian carcinoma.
> It is also elevated in carcinomas of the fallopian tube, endometrium,
> and endocervix. An elevated level may also be associated with the
> presence of a malignant mesothelioma or primary peritoneal carcinoma.
>
> A CA 125 level may be obtained as part of the initial pre-operative
> work-up for women presenting with a suspicious pelvic mass to be used
> as a baseline for purposes of post- operative monitoring. Initial
> declines in CA 125 after initial surgery and/or chemotherapy for
> ovarian carcinoma are also measured by obtaining three serum levels
> during the first month post treatment to determine the patient's CA
> 125 half-life, which has significant prognostic implications.
>
> The CA 125 levels are again obtained at the completion of chemotherapy
> as an index of residual disease. Surveillance CA 125 measurements are
> generally obtained every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for the
> next 3 years, and yearly thereafter. CA 125 levels are also an
> important indicator of a patient's response to therapy in the presence
> of advanced or recurrent disease. In this setting, CA 125 levels may
> be obtained prior to each treatment cycle.

## Limitations

> These services are not covered for the evaluation of patients with

# - Prostate Specific Antigen

## (Rev. 17, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable) PM AB-02-110

> Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), a tumor marker for adenocarcinoma of
> the prostate, can predict residual tumor in the post-operative phase
> of prostate cancer. Three to six months after radical prostatectomy,
> PSA is reported to provide a sensitive indicator of persistent
> disease. Six months following introduction of antiandrogen therapy,
> PSA is reported as capable of distinguishing patients with favorable
> response form those in whom limited response is anticipated.
>
> The PSA when used in conjunction with other prostate cancer tests,
> such as digital rectal examination, may assist in the decision making
> process for diagnosing prostate cancer, PSA also, serves as a marker
> in following the progress of most prostate tumors once a diagnosis has
> been established. This test is also an aid in the management of
> prostate cancer patients and in detecting metastatic or persistent
> disease in patients following treatment.

## Indications

> The PSA is of proven value in differentiating benign from malignant
> disease in men with lower urinary tract signs and symptoms (e.g.,
> hematuria, slow urine stream, hesitancy, urgency, frequency, nocturia
> and incontinence) as well as with patients with palpably abnormal
> prostate glands on physician exam, and in patients with other
> laboratory or imaging studies that suggest the possibility of a
> malignant prostate disorder. PSA is also a marker used to follow the
> progress of prostate cancer once a diagnosis has been established,
> such as in detecting metastatic or persistent disease in patients who
> may require additional treatment. PSA testing may also be useful in
> the differential diagnosis of men presenting with as yet undiagnosed
> disseminated metastatic disease.

## Limitations

> Generally, for patients with lower urinary tract signs or symptoms,
> the test is performed only once per year unless there is a change in
> the patient's medical condition.
>
> Testing with a diagnosis of in situ carcinoma is not reasonably done

# - Gamma Glutamyl Transferase

## (Rev. 17, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable) PM AB-02-110

> Gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) is an intracellular enzyme that
> appears in blood following leakage from cells. Renal tubules, liver,
> and pancreas contain high amounts, although the measurement of GGT
> serum is almost always used for assessment of hepatobiliary function.
> Unlike other enzymes, which are found in heart, skeletal muscle, and
> intestinal mucosa as well as liver, the appearance of an elevated
> level of GGT is serum is almost always the result of liver disease or
> injury. It is specifically useful to differentiate elevated alkaline
> phosphatase level when the source of the alkaline phosphatase increase
> (bone, liver, or placenta) is unclear. The combination of high
> alkaline phosphatase and a normal GGT does not, however, rule out
> liver disease completely.
>
> As well as being a very specific marker of hepatobiliary function, GGT
> is also a very sensitive marker for hepatocellular damage. Abnormal
> concentrations typically appear before elevations of other liver
> enzymes or bilirubin are evident. Obstruction of the biliary tract,
> viral infection (e.g., hepatitis, mononucleosis), metastatic cancer,
> exposure to hepatotoxins (e.g., organic cimetidine, barbiturates,
> phenytoin, and carbamazepine) all can cause a moderate to marked
> increase in GGT serum concentration. In addition, some drugs can cause
> or exacerbate liver dysfunction (e.g., atorvastatin, troglitazone, and
> others as noted in FDA Contraindications and Warning.)
>
> The GGT is useful for diagnosis of liver disease or injury, exclusion
> of hepatobiliary involvement related to other disease, and patient
> management during the resolution of existing disease or following
> injury.

## Indications

1.  To provide information about known or suspected hepatobiliary
    disease, for example:

    a.  Following chronic alcohol or drug ingestion

    b.  Following exposure to hepatotoxins

    c.  When using medication known to have a potential for causing
        liver toxicity (e.g., following the drug manufacturer's
        recommendations)

    d.  Following infection (e.g., viral hepatitis and other specific
        infections such as amebiasis, tuberculosis, psittacosis, and
        similar infections)

2.  To assess liver injury/function following diagnosis of primary or
    secondary malignant neoplasms

3.  To assess liver injury/function in a wide variety of disorders and
    diseases known to cause liver involvement (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
    malnutrition, disorders of iron and mineral metabolism, sarcoidosis,
    amyloidosis, lupus and hypertension)

4.  To assess liver function related to gastrointestinal disease

5.  To assess liver function related to pancreatic disease

6.  To assess liver function in patients subsequent to liver
    > transplantation

7.  To differentiate between the different sources of elevated alkaline
    phosphatase activity

## Limitations

> When used to assess liver dysfunction secondary to existing
> non-hepatobiliary disease with no change in signs, symptoms, or
> treatment, it is generally not necessary to repeat a GGT determination
> after a normal result has been obtained unless new indications are
> present.
>
> If the GGT is the only "liver" enzyme abnormally high, it is generally
> not necessary to pursue further evaluation for liver disease for this
> specific indication.
>
> When used to determine if other abnormal enzyme tests reflect liver
> abnormality rather than other tissue, it generally is not necessary to
> repeat a GGT more than one time per week.
>
> Because of the extreme sensitivity of GGT as a marker for cytochrome
> oxidase induction or cell membrane permeability, it is generally not
> useful in monitoring patients with known liver disease.

# - Hepatitis Panel/Acute Hepatitis Panel

## (Rev. 17, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable) PM AB-02-110

> This panel consists of the following tests:

-   Hepatitis A antibody (HAAb), IgM antibody;

-   Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), IgM antibody;

-   Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and;

-   Hepatitis C antibody;

> Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver resulting from viruses,
> drugs, toxins, and other etiologies. Viral hepatitis can be due to one
> of at least five different viruses, designated hepatitis A, B, C, and
> E. Most cases are caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus
> (HBV), or hepatitis C virus, (HCV).
>
> The HAV is the most common cause of hepatitis in children and
> adolescents in the United States. Prior exposure is indicated by a
> positive IgG anti-HAV. Acute HAV is diagnosed by IgM anti-HAV, which
> typically appears within four weeks of exposure, and which disappears
> within three months of its appearance. IgG anti- HAV is similar in the
> timing of its appearance, but it persists indefinitely. Its detection
> indicates prior effective immunization or recovery form infection.
>
> Although HAV is spread most commonly by fecal-oral exposure, standard
> immune globulin may be effective as a prophylaxis.
>
> The HBV produces three separate antigen (surface, cores and e
> (envelope) antigens) when it infects the liver, although only
> hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is included as part of this panel.
> Following exposure, the body normally responds by producing antibodies
> to each of these antigens; one of which is included in this panel:
> hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb)-IgM antibody, HBsAg is the
> earlier marker, appearing in serum four to eight weeks after exposure,
> and typically disappearing within 6 months after its appearance. If
> HBsAg remains detectable for greater than 6 months, this indicates
> chronic HBV infection. HBcAb, in the form of both IgG and IgM
> antibodies, are next to appear in serum, typically becoming detectable
> 2-3 months following exposure. The IgM antibody gradually declines or
> disappears entirely 1-2 years following exposure, but the IgG usually
> remains detectable for life. Because HBsAg is present for a relatively
> short period and usually displays a low titer, a negative result does
> not exclude and HBV diagnosis. HBcAb, on the other hand, rises to a
> much higher titer and remain elevated for a longer period of time, but
> a positive result is not diagnostic of acute disease, since it may be
> the result of a prior infection. The last marker to appear in the
> course of a typical infection is HBsAb, which appears in serum 4-6
> months following exposure to infected blood or body fluids; in the
> U.S., sexual transmission accounts for 30-60 percent of new cases of
> HBV infection.
>
> The diagnosis of acute HBV infection is best established by
> documentation of positive IgM antibody against the core antigen
> (HBcAb-IgM) and by identification of a positive hepatitis B surface
> antigen (HBsAg). The diagnosis of chronic HBV infection is established
> primarily by identifying a positive hepatitis B surface antigen
> (HBsAg) and demonstrating positive IgG antibody directed against the
> core antigen (HBcAb-IgG). Additional tests such as hepatitis B e
> antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), the envelope
> antigen and antibody, are not included in the hepatitis panel, but may
> be of importance in assessing the infectivity of patients with HBV.
> Following completion of a HBV vaccination series, HBsAB alone may be
> used monthly for up to 6 months, or until a positive result is
> obtained, to verify an adequate antibody response.
>
> HCV is the most common cause of post-transfusion hepatitis; overall
> HCV is responsible for 15-20 percent of all cases of acute hepatitis,
> and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. The test most
> commonly used to identify HCV measures HCV antibodies, which appear in
> blood 2-4 months after infection. False
>
> positive HCV results can occur. For example, a patient with a recent
> yeast infection may produce a false positive anti-HCV result. For this
> reason, at present positive results usually are confirmed by a more
> specific technique. Like HBV, HCV is spread exclusively through
> exposure to infected blood or body fluids.
>
> This panel of tests is used for differential diagnosis in a patient
> with symptoms of liver disease or injury. When the time of exposure or
> the stage of the disease is not known, a patient with continued
> symptoms of liver disease despite a completely negative hepatitis
> panel may need a repeat panel approximately 2 weeks to 2 months later
> to exclude the possibility of hepatitis. Once a diagnosis is
> established, specific tests can be used to monitor the course of the
> disease.

## Indications

1.  To detect viral hepatitis infection when there are abnormal liver
    function test results, with or without signs or symptoms of
    hepatitis.

2.  Prior to and subsequent to liver transplantation.

## Limitations

> After a hepatitis diagnosis has been established, only individual
> tests, rather than the entire panel, are needed.

# - Fecal Occult Blood Test

## (Rev. 17, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable) PM AB 02-110

> The fecal occult blood test (FOBT) detects the presence of trace
> amounts of blood in stool. The procedure is performed by testing one
> or several small samples of one, two or three different stool
> specimens.
>
> This test may be performed with or without evidence of iron deficiency
> anemia, which may be related to gastrointestinal blood loss. The range
> of causes for blood loss include inflammatory causes, including
> acid-peptic disease, non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drug use, hiatal
> hernia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroenteritis,
> strongyloides, ascariasis, tuberculosis, and enteroamebiasis. Vascular
> causes included angiodysplasia, hemangiomas, varices, blue rubber bleb
> nevus syndrome, and watermelon stomach. Tumors and neoplastic causes
> include lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma, lipomas, adenocarcinoma and primary
> and secondary metastases to the GI tract. Drugs such as nonsteroidal
> anti-inflammatory drugs also cause bleeding. There are extra
> gastrointestinal causes such as hemoptysis, epistaxis, and
> oropharyngeal bleeding. Artifactual causes include hematuria, and
> menstrual bleeding. In addition, there may be other causes such as
> coagulopathies, gastrostomy tubes or other appliances, factitial
> causes, and long distance running.
>
> Three basic types of fecal hemoglobin assays exist, each directed at a
> different component of the hemoglobin molecule.

1.  Immunoassays recognize antigenic sites on the globin portion and are
    least affected by diet or proximal gut bleeding, but the antigen may
    be destroyed by fecal flora.

2.  The heme-porphyrin assay measures heme-derived porphyrin and is
    least influenced by enterocolic metabolism or fecal storage. This
    assay does not discriminate dietary from endogenous heme. The
    capacity to detect proximal gut bleeding reduces its specificity for
    colorectal cancer screening but makes it more useful for evaluating
    overall GI bleeding in case finding for iron deficiency anemia.

3.  The guaiac-based test is the most widely used. It requires the
    peroxidase activity of an intact heme moiety to be reactive.
    Positivity rates fall with storage. Fecal hydration such as adding a
    drop of water increases the test reactivity but also increases false
    positivity.

> Of these three tests, the guaiac-based test is the most sensitive for
> detecting lower bowel bleeding. Because of this sensitivity, it is
> advisable, when it is used for screening, to defer the guaiac-based
> test if other studies of the colon are performed prior to the test.
> Similarly, this test's sensitivity may result in a false positive if
> the patient has recently ingested meat. Both of these cautions are
> appropriate when the test is used for screening, but when appropriate
> indications are present, the test should be done despite its
> limitations.

## Indications

1.  To evaluate known or suspected alimentary tract conditions that
    might cause bleeding into the intestinal tract.

2.  To evaluate unexpected anemia.

3.  To evaluate abnormal signs, symptoms, or complaints that might be
    associated with loss of blood.

4.  To evaluate patients complaints of black or red-tinged stools.

> Limitations

1.  The FOBT is reported once for the testing of up to three separate
    specimens (comprising either one or two tests per specimen).

2.  In patients who are taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and
    have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding but no other sign,
    symptoms, or complaints

> associated with gastrointestinal blood loss, testing for occult blood
> may generally be appropriate no more than once every 3 months.
>
> When testing is done for the purpose of screening for colorectal
> cancer in the absence of signs, symptoms, conditions, or complaints
> associated with gastrointestinal blood loss, report he HCPCS code for
> colorectal cancer screening; fecal-occult blood test, 1-3 simultaneous
> determinations) should be used.
