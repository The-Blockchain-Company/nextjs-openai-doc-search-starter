## - *Billing for Additional Treatments*

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

-   *The End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Prospective Payment System (PPS)
    provides a per treatment unit of payment. The per treatment unit of
    payment is the same base rate that is paid for all dialysis
    treatment modalities furnished by an ESRD facility. The policy
    allows for 3 PPS payments per week. When a beneficiary's plan of
    care requires more than three weekly dialysis treatments, whether HD
    or daily PD, claim edits are applied to ensure that Medicare payment
    on the monthly claim is consistent with the 3- times weekly dialysis
    treatment payment limit. Thus, for a 30-day month, payment is
    limited to 13 treatments, and for a 31-day month, payment is limited
    to 14 treatments, with exceptions made for medical justification.*

-   *ESRD facilities billing for more than 13 or 14 treatments per month
    must provide medical justification as required by the Medicare
    Administrative Contractor in order to receive payment for the
    additional treatments. Additional treatments provided without
    meeting the medical justification required must include the modifier
    CG on the claim line. This modifier indicates that the facility
    attests the additional treatment does not meet medical justification
    requirements. Additional treatments billed without medical
    justification do not receive payment. Non-covered treatments are not
    considered in the outlier payment calculation.*

-   *This policy does not apply for training and retraining treatments
    billed within the allowable limits. See section 50.8 of this chapter
    for training and retraining treatments.*

# - Uncompleted Treatments

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> *A* dialysis treatment is started, *when* a patient is connected to
> the machine and a dialyzer and bloodlines are used. *However, if the*
> is not completed for some unforeseen, but valid reason *such as* a
> medical emergency when the patient must be rushed to an emergency
> room, the facility is paid based on the full *Prospective Payment
> System (PPS) base rate* This is a rare occurrence and must be fully
> documented to the A/B MAC (A)'s satisfaction.

# - No-Shows

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> If a facility sets up in preparation for a dialysis treatment, but the
> treatment is never started *because* the patient never arrives, no
> payment is made. In this case, no service has been furnished to a
> Medicare beneficiary even though staff time and supplies may have been
> used. Furthermore, the facility may not bill the patient or the
> patient's private insurance for these services. This is because the
> program is already paying the cost of pre-dialysis services through
> the *PPS base rate*. In setting that rate, CMS has included the
> salaries of facility personnel and the cost of supplies used for
> furnishing pre-dialysis services.
>
> Therefore, these costs (e.g., salaries for staff time, overhead,
> supply costs) are included in the facility's costs and reported on its
> cost report, and they are included in the allowable costs used to set
> future reimbursement rates under the *End Stage Renal Disease
> Prospective Payment System (ESRD PPS)* for ESRD facilities. However,
> these costs may not be used as the basis for a facility to be
> reimbursed as Medicare bad debts.

# - Deductible and Coinsurance

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> The beneficiary is responsible for any unmet deductible and for
> coinsurance.
>
> *Eighty percent of the total End Stage Renal Disease Prospective
> Payment System (ESRD PPS) payment amount for renal dialysis services
> furnished by ESRD facilities to ESRD beneficiaries is paid by
> Medicare. ESRD beneficiaries are responsible for the remaining twenty
> percent after the deductible. Therefore, the beneficiary coinsurance
> amount under the ESRD PPS is twenty percent of the total ESRD PPS
> payment, which includes the ESRD PPS base rate, all applicable
> adjustments, any applicable training add-on amounts and any applicable
> outlier payments.*

# - Hospital Services

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> Outpatient dialysis services for a patient with acute kidney failure
> or chronic kidney failure but not eligible for Medicare under the ESRD
> provisions at the time services are rendered must be billed by the
> hospital and cannot be billed by a Medicare certified renal dialysis
> facility on bill type 72x.
>
> Hospitals with a Medicare certified renal dialysis facility should
> have outpatient ESRD related services billed by the hospital-based
> renal dialysis facility on bill type 72x.
>
> Hospitals that do not have a Medicare certified renal dialysis
> facility may bill for outpatient emergency or unscheduled dialysis
> services. The *Prospective Payment System (PPS) base rate* is not
> paid. For more information regarding the outpatient hospital billing
> policy for ESRD related services, see chapter 4 section 210 of this
> manual.
>
> When an individual is furnished outpatient hospital services and is
> thereafter admitted as an inpatient of the same hospital due to renal
> failure - within 24 hours for non PPS hospitals and within 72 hours
> for PPS hospitals - the outpatient hospital services furnished are
> treated as inpatient services unless the patient does not have Part A
> coverage. Charges are reported on the ASC X12 837 institutional claim
> format or on Form CMS-1450. The day on which the patient is formally
> admitted as an inpatient is counted as the first inpatient day. The
> *PPS base rate* is not paid.

# - Amount of Payment

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> Effective for dates of service beginning January 1, 2011, after the
> beneficiary's Part B deductible is met, the A/B MACs (A) pay 80
> percent of the ESRD PPS base rate and all applicable adjustments (or
> the blended payment amount if the facility chooses to transition), for
> each outpatient maintenance dialysis treatment furnished to the ESRD
> beneficiary in the ESRD facility or at the beneficiary's home.

# - ESRD Services Not Provided Within the United States

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Services (except for certain inpatient hospital services and related
> physicians and ambulance services in specified situations) that are
> not provided within the United States are not covered. United States

> Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American
> Samoa. See Chapter 1 for additional information concerning specified
> situations that may be covered, billing and payment procedures and
> jurisdiction for payment.

# - Transportation Services

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> In general, transportation services to obtain ESRD services are not
> covered. However, see the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 10,
> for coverage of ambulance services to renal dialysis facilities
> located on hospital premises and for coverage of ambulance services to

# -- Dialysis Provider Number Series

### (Rev. 771, Issued: 12-02-05, Effective: 01-03-06, Implementation: 01-03-06)

> There are multiple facilities that provide dialysis services to ESRD
> beneficiaries. To ensure that provider data is correct, facilities are
> required to use a Provider Number based on facility type issued by
> CMS.
>
> The Provider Number Series for Dialysis Providers are as follows (for
> CMS use only, effective May 23, 2007, providers are required to submit
> only their National Provider Identifier (NPI). The dialysis provider
> numbers will be mapped to the NPI):

-   Patient Height

-   Patient Weight

-   Patient BSA

-   Patient BMI

-   BSA factor

-   BMI factor

-   Condition Code 73 adjustment (if applicable)

-   Condition Code 74 adjustment (if applicable)

-   *Condition Code 84 for AKI patients (if applicable)*

-   *Condition Code 87 adjustment (if applicable)*

> In addition to the above adjustments, the following adjustments may be
> applicable to the ESRD PPS base rate for **adult** patient claims with
> dates of service on or after January 1, 2011:

-   Onset of Dialysis

-   Patient Comorbidities

-   Low-Volume ESRD Facility

### Onset of Dialysis:

> Providers will receive an adjustment to the ESRD PPS base rate for
> patients within the initial 120 calendar days from when an ESRD
> beneficiary began their maintenance dialysis. The provider does not
> report anything on the claim for this adjustment. The adjustment is
> determined by the start date of dialysis in the Common Working File as
> reported on the patient's 2728 form. When the onset of dialysis
> adjustment is provided, the claim is not entitled to a comorbidity
> adjustment or a training add-on adjustment.

#### *Patient Comorbidities:*

> The ESRD PPS will provide adjustments for *each category* of *chronic
> and acute* comorbidity conditions, 3 categories of chronic conditions
> and 3 categories of acute conditions. **In the event that more than
> one of the comorbidity categories is present on the claim, the claim
> will be adjusted for the highest paying comorbidity category.**
>
> *[Chronic Comorbidities]{.underline}*
>
> *When chronic comorbidity codes are reported on the claim an
> adjustment may be made for as long as the chronic condition remains
> applicable to the patient care provided and is reported on the claim.*
>
> *[Acute Comorbidities]{.underline}*
>
> *Acute comorbidity category adjustments will be eligible for a payment
> for the first month reported and then for the next three consecutive
> months, regardless of whether or not the diagnosis code is on the
> claim after the first month. This adjustment applies for no more than
> four consecutive months for any reported acute comorbidity category.
> Acute comorbidity conditions reported for more than four consecutive
> months will not receive additional payment.*
>
> *In the event that the comorbidity condition was resolved and later
> reoccurred, the provider may submit a condition code to indicate the
> diagnosis is a reoccurrence. The adjustment will be applicable for an
> additional four months.*
>
> *For a list of specific acute and chronic* comorbid conditions
> eligible for adjustment, *refer to* the following website:
>
> [[https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ESRDpayment/Patient-Level-Adjustments)
> [[Payment/ESRDpayment/Patient-Level-Adjustments]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ESRDpayment/Patient-Level-Adjustments)
>
> This list may be updated as often as quarterly in January, April, July
> and October of each year.

### Low-Volume *ESRD* Facilities:

> ESRD facilities will receive an adjustment to their ESRD PPS base rate
> when the facility furnished less than 4,000 treatments in each of the
> three cost report years preceding the payment year and has not open,
> closed, or received a new provider number due to a change in ownership
> during the 3 years preceding the payment year. The ESRD facility must
> notify their A/B MAC (A) if they believe they are eligible for the
> low-volume adjustment. The A/B MAC (A) must validate the eligibility
> and update the provider specific file. Pediatric patient claims are
> not eligible for the low-volume adjustment.
>
> A/B MACs (A) are instructed to validate the facility's eligibility for
> the low volume adjustment. If an A/B MAC (A) determines that an ESRD
> facility has received the low volume adjustment in error, the A/B MAC
> (A) is required to adjust all of the ESRD facility's affected claims
> to remove the adjustment within 6 months of finding the error.
>
> In addition to the above adjustments, the following adjustments may be
> applicable to the ESRD PPS base rate for **adult and pediatric**
> patient claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2011:
>
> **Training Adjustment:** The ESRD PPS provides a training add-on of
> \$33.44 adjusted by the geographic area wage index that accounts for
> an hour of nursing time for training treatments. The add-on applies to
> both PD and HD training treatments**.**

### ESRD PPS Outlier Payments:

> *The ESRD Prospective Payment System (PPS) includes a payment
> adjustment for high cost outliers when there are unusual variations in
> the type or amount of medically necessary care.*
>
> *Outlier consideration is provided for the following:*

-   *ESRD-related drugs and biologicals that were or would have been
    > prior to January 1, 2011, separately billable under Medicare Part
    > B;*

-   *ESRD-related laboratory tests that were or would have been, prior
    > to January 1, 2011 separately billable under Part B;*

-   *Medical/surgical supplies, including syringes, used to administer
    > ESRD-related drugs that were or would have been prior to January
    > 1, 2011, separately billable under Medicare Part B; and*

-   *Renal dialysis service drugs that were or would have been, prior to
    > January 1, 2011 covered under Medicare Part D.*

-   *For new injectable renal dialysis drugs and biologicals that are
    > eligible outlier services, ESRD facilities should report J3591
    > with the National Drug Code (NDC) in the 11-digit format 5-4-2.
    > The MAC will set the payment rate based on pricing methodologies
    > under 1847A of the Act using the guidance in the Medicare Claims
    > Processing Manual, Chapter 17 - Drugs and Biologicals, Section
    > 20.1.3 - Exceptions to Average Sales Price (ASP) Payment
    > Methodology.*

> *Statute requires the delay of the implementation of the oral-only
> renal dialysis service policy until January 1, 2025.* Services not
> included in the PPS that remain separately payable are not considered
> outlier services.
>
> When the ESRD PRICER returns an outlier payment, the standard systems
> shall display the total applicable outlier payment on the claim with
> value code 17.
>
> Information related to the outlier services eligible for adjustment
> can be found at the following website:
>
> [[http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ESRDpayment/Outlier_Services.html)
> [[Payment/ESRDpayment/Outlier_Services.html]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ESRDpayment/Outlier_Services.html)
>
> This list may be updated as often as quarterly in January, April, July
> and October of each year.
>
> For claims submitted with dates of service on or after January 1,
> 2012, all drugs reported on the ESRD claim under revenue codes 0634,
> 0635 and 0636 with a rate available on the ASP file will be considered
> in the Medicare allowed payment (MAP) amount for outlier consideration
> with the exception of any drugs reported with the AY modifier and
> drugs included in the original composite rate payment system.

#### *Transitional Drug Add-On Payment Adjustment (TDAPA)*

> *Effective January 1, 2016 under the ESRD PPS drug designation
> process, CMS provides payment using a Transitional Drug Add-on Payment
> Adjustment (TDAPA) for new renal dialysis new injectable or
> intravenous drugs and biologicals that qualify under 42 CFR
> 413.234(c)(1).*
>
> *CMS will pay for the drug or biological using a transitional drug
> add-on payment adjustment, if the new injectable or intravenous drug
> or biological is used to treat or manage a condition for which there
> is not an existing ESRD PPS functional category. CMS bases the TDAPA
> on payment methodologies under section 1847A of the Social Security
> Act which are discussed in Pub. 100-04, Chapter 17, Section 20. The
> MAC will set the payment rate based on pricing methodologies under
> 1847A of the Act using the guidance in the Medicare Claims Processing
> Manual, Chapter 17 - Drugs and Biologicals, Section 20.1.3 -
> Exceptions to Average Sales Price (ASP) Payment Methodology. This
> payment is applicable for a period of 2 years.*
>
> *While the TDAPA applies to a new injectable or intravenous drug or
> biological, the drug or biological is not considered an outlier
> service, is not separately payable with the AY modifier and does not
> apply to acute kidney injury claims (AKI).*
>
> *Drugs eligible for the TDAPA must billed with revenue code 0636 and
> modifier AX must be appended to the HCPCS.*

-   *The TDAPA claim lines are shown as covered line items but no
    > payment will be included on the line item. The TDAPA is included
    > in the prospective payment amount on the dialysis revenue code
    > lines.*

-   *Q8 payer only value code captures the total allowable payment for
    > the TDAPA. The ESRD pricer divides the Q8 amount by the total
    > number of dialysis treatments and the per treatment amount is
    > added to PPS rate and included in each dialysis line payment.*

> *Additional information on the TDAPA is available on the CMS website
> located at:
> [[https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ESRDpayment/ESRD-Transitional-Drug)
> [[Payment/ESRDpayment/ESRD-Transitional-Drug]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ESRDpayment/ESRD-Transitional-Drug)*

#### *Transitional Add-on Payment Adjustment for New and Innovative Equipment and* Supplies (TPNIES)

> *Beginning January 1, 2020, the ESRD PPS provides the Transitional
> Add-on Payment Adjustment for New and Innovative Equipment and
> Supplies (TPNIES) for new and innovative renal dialysis equipment and
> supplies that qualify under § 413.236.*
>
> *The TPNIES payment is based on 65 percent of the Medicare
> Administrative Contractor (MAC) determined price. The MACs, on behalf
> of CMS, establish prices for new and innovative renal dialysis
> equipment and supplies that meet the TPNIES eligibility criteria using
> verifiable information from the following sources of information, if
> available:*

-   *the invoice amount, facility charges for the item, discounts,
    > allowances, and rebates;*

-   *the price established for the item by other MACs and the sources of
    > information used to establish that price;*

-   *payment amounts determined by other payers and the information used
    > to establish those payment amounts;*

-   *charges and payment amounts required for other equipment and
    > supplies that may be comparable or otherwise relevant.*

> *The TPNIES is paid for 2 calendar years, beginning on January 1 and
> ending on December 31. While the TPNIES applies to a new and
> innovative equipment or supply, the equipment or supply is not
> considered an outlier service.*
>
> *Items eligible for the TPNIES must billed with revenue code 027X and
> modifier AX must be appended to the HCPCS. Until TPNIES items receive
> a HCPCS the TPNIES supplies are reported with HCPCS A4913 for
> miscellaneous dialysis supply not otherwise specified and for TPNIES
> equipment HCPCS E1699 is reported for miscellaneous dialysis equipment
> not otherwise specified.*

-   *The TPNIES claim lines are shown as covered line items but no
    > payment will be included on the line item. The TPNIES is included
    > in the prospective payment amount on the dialysis revenue code
    > lines.*

-   *QG payer only value code captures the total allowable price for the
    > TPNIES. The ESRD pricer calculates the 65 percent of the MAC
    > determined price and divides the amount by the total number of
    > dialysis treatments and the per treatment amount is added to PPS
    > rate and included in each dialysis line payment.*

-   Provider Type

-   Drug add-on

-   Budget Neutrality Factor

-   Patient Age

-   Patient Height

-   Patient Weight

-   Patient BSA

-   Patient BMI

-   BSA factor

-   BMI factor

-   Condition Code 73 adjustment (if applicable)

-   Condition Code 74 adjustment (if applicable)

> In addition to the above adjustments, the following adjustments may be
> applicable to the ESRD PPS base rate for **adult** patient claims with
> dates of service on or after January 1, 2011:

-   Onset of Dialysis

-   Patient Co-morbidities

-   Low-Volume ESRD Facility

### Onset of Dialysis:

> Providers will receive an adjustment to the ESRD PPS base rate for
> patients within the initial 120 calendar days from when an ESRD
> beneficiary began their maintenance dialysis. The provider does not
> report anything on the claim for this adjustment. The adjustment is
> determined by the start date of dialysis in the Common Working File as
> reported on the patient's 2728 form. When the onset of dialysis
> adjustment is provided, the claim is not entitled to a co-morbidity
> adjustment or a training add-on adjustment.

### Co-morbidity Adjustment Categories

> The ESRD PPS will provide adjustments for 6 categories of co-morbidity
> conditions, 3 categories of chronic conditions and 3 categories of
> acute conditions. **In the event that more than one of the
> co-morbidity categories is present on the claim, the claim will be
> adjusted for the highest paying co-morbidity category.**

### Acute Co-morbidity Diagnostic Categories:

> The acute co-morbidity categories will be eligible for a payment for
> the first month reported and the following 3 consecutive months. Acute
> co-morbidity conditions reported for more than 4 consecutive months
> will not receive additional payment. In the event that the
> co-morbidity condition was resolved and later reoccurred, the provider
> may submit a condition code to indicate the diagnosis is a
> reoccurrence. The adjustment will be applicable for an additional 4
> months.
>
> Acute Categories are:

-   Gastro-intestinal tract bleeding

-   Bacterial pneumonia

-   Pericarditis

### Chronic Co-morbidity Diagnostic Categories:

> When chronic co-morbidity codes are reported on the claim an
> adjustment may be made for as long as the chronic condition remains
> applicable to the patient care provided and is reported on the claim.
>
> Chronic Categories are:

-   Hereditary hemolytic or sickle cell anemia

-   Monoclonal gammopathy

-   Myelodysplastic syndrome

> Information related to the comorbid conditions eligible for adjustment
> can be found at the following website:
>
> [[http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ESRDpayment/Comorbidity_Conditions.html)
> [[Payment/ESRDpayment/Comorbidity_Conditions.html]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ESRDpayment/Comorbidity_Conditions.html)
>
> This list may be updated as often as quarterly in January, April, July
> and October of each year.

### Low-Volume Facilities:

> ESRD facilities will receive an adjustment to their ESRD PPS base rate
> when the facility furnished less than 4,000 treatments in each of the
> three cost report years preceding the payment year and has not open,
> closed, or received a new provider number due to a change in ownership
> during the 3 years preceding the payment year. The ESRD facility must
> notify their A/B MAC (A) if they believe they are eligible for the
> low-volume adjustment. The A/B MAC (A) must validate the eligibility
> and update the provider specific file. Pediatric patient claims are
> not eligible for the low-volume adjustment.
>
> A/B MACs (A) are instructed to validate the facility's eligibility for
> the low volume adjustment. If an A/B MAC (A) determines that an ESRD
> facility has received the low volume adjustment in error, the A/B MAC
> (A) is required to adjust all of the ESRD facility's affected claims
> to remove the adjustment within 6 months of finding the error.
>
> In addition to the above adjustments, the following adjustments may be
> applicable to the ESRD PPS base rate for **adult and pediatric**
> patient claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2011:
>
> **Training Adjustment:** The ESRD PPS provides a training add-on of
> \$33.44 adjusted by the geographic area wage index that accounts for
> an hour of nursing time for training treatments. The add-on applies to
> both PD and HD training treatments**.**

### ESRD PPS Outlier Payments:

> Outlier payments may be applied to the payment. ESRD outlier services
> are the following items and services that are included in the ESRD PPS
> bundle: (1) ESRD- related drugs and biologicals that were or would
> have been prior to January 1, 2011, separately billable under Medicare
> Part B; (2) ESRD-related laboratory tests that were or would have
> been, prior to January 1, 2011 separately billable under Part B; (3)
> medical/surgical supplies, including syringes, used to administer
> ESRD-related drugs that were or would have been prior to January 1,
> 2011, separately billable under Medicare Part B; and (4) renal
> dialysis service drugs that were or would have been, prior to January
> 1, 2011 covered under Medicare Part D. ESRD-related oral only drugs
> are delayed until January 1, 2014. Services not included in the PPS
> that remain separately payable are not considered outlier services.
>
> When the ESRD PRICER returns an outlier payment, the standard systems
> shall display the total applicable outlier payment on the claim with
> value code 17.
>
> Information related to the outlier services eligible for adjustment
> can be found at the following website:

> [[Payment/ESRDpayment/Outlier_Services.html]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ESRDpayment/Outlier_Services.html)
>
> This list may be updated as often as quarterly in January, April, July
> and October of each year.
>
> For claims submitted with dates of service on or after January 1,
> 2012, all drugs reported on the ESRD claim under revenue codes 0634,
> 0635 and 0636 with a rate available on the ASP file will be considered
> in the Medicare allowed payment (MAP) amount for outlier consideration
> with the exception of any drugs reported with the AY modifier and
> drugs included in the original composite rate payment system.

### Value Codes and Amounts

48. \- Hemoglobin Reading - Code indicates the most recent hemoglobin
    reading taken before the start of this billing period. This is
    usually reported in three positions with a decimal. Use the right of
    the delimiter for the third digit.

> The blood sample for the hemoglobin reading must be obtained before
> the dialysis treatment. If a hemoglobin value is not available
> facilities must report the value 99.99.

49. \- Hematocrit Reading - Code indicates the most recent hematocrit
    reading taken before the start of this billing period. This is
    usually reported in two positions (a percentage) to the left of the
    dollar/cents delimiter. If the reading is provided with a decimal,
    use the position to the right of the delimiter for the third digit.

> The blood sample for the hematocrit reading must be obtained before
> the dialysis treatment. If a hematocrit value is not available

# - Calculation for Double Amputee Dialysis Patients

### (Rev. 1389; Issued: 12-07-07; Effective: 01-01-08; Implementation: 01-07-08)

> For dialysis treatments on or after January 1, 2006, we are revising
> the reporting requirements for value codes A8 and A9 for double
> amputee dialysis patients.
>
> Weight should be calculated based on pre-amputation weight using the
> following formula: Pre-amputation weight = Actual weight x 1.15
>
> Example: Current weight for double amputee patient = 75.5 kg.
>
> Pre-Amputation weight = 75.5 x 1.15 = 89kg.
>
> The results should be reported under value code A8.
>
> Height should be reported under value code A9 as pre-amputation
> height. Where feasible this measurement may be obtained from Form
> 2728.

> the emergency room or department does not mean that *End Stage Renal
> Disease (ESRD)* facilities should send patients to the emergency room
> or department for routine laboratory testing or for the provision of
> renal dialysis services that should be provided by ESRD facilities.
> The intent of the bypass is to acknowledge that there are emergency

> may enter their composite and/or EPO rates.
>
> Neither revenue codes nor charges for services included in the
> composite rate may be billed separately (see §90.3 for a description).
> Hospitals must maintain a log of these charges in their records for
> cost apportionment purposes.
>
> Services which are provided but which are not included in the
> composite rate may be billed as described in sections that address
> those specific services.
>
> The last revenue code entered in as 000l represents the total of all
> charges billed.

### Principal Diagnosis Code

> Hospital-based and independent renal facilities must complete this
> item and it should include a diagnosis of end stage renal disease *for
> patients with ESRD. For patients with AKI see section 40 of this
> chapter.*

### Other Diagnosis Code(s)

> For claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2011 renal
> dialysis facilities report the appropriate diagnosis code(s) for
> comorbidity conditions eligible for an adjustment.

# - Submitting Corrected Bills

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Claimants must submit a corrected claim if any of the following apply
> to a previously processed claim:

-   A change in provider number;

-   A change in coinsurance involves an amount greater than \$1.99; or

-   A change in visits (decrease or increase).

> Claimants must follow procedures for submitting corrected bills in
> Chapter 26.

# - Line Item Detail Billing and Automated Claim Adjustments

### (Rev. 1364, Issued: 11-02-07: Effective: 04-01-08; Implantation: 04-07-08)

> The implementation of line item detail billing for ESRD claims
> effective on April 1, 2007 requires that each service be submitted on
> a separate line with the appropriate line item date of service. The
> Medicare standard systems perform line item date of service compare
> for RDFs claims with statement billing periods overlapping the
> statement billing period of another processed claim. This prevents
> monthly claims from receiving overlapping edits based on the statement
> billing period dates but rather, only when the RDF claim has a line
> item that duplicates another processed claim or falls within the dates
> of an inpatient hospital stay. Standard systems reject only those
> overlapping line items while any line items not overlapping another
> claim continue to process for payment. As a result of this logic, the
> RDFs no longer have to submit the occurrence span code 74 on the
> monthly dialysis claim when an inpatient stay occurred during the same
> month.
>
> The initial line item detail billing instruction did not implement a
> process for rejecting services on the RDF claim overlapping an
> inpatient stay when the RDF claim is received before the inpatient
> hospital claim. A subsequent instruction implemented for April 1, 2008
> requires the Medicare Common Working File (CWF) to create an
> informational unsolicited response prompting the standard system to
> perform an automated adjustment of the processed 72x claim that
> contains line item dates of service that are overlapping dates of an
> incoming inpatient hospital claim. The admission and discharge dates
> of an inpatient stay are not considered overlapping dates and may be
> payable to the RDF.

# - In-Facility Back-Up Dialysis

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> Back-up dialysis is an in-facility dialysis treatment furnished to a

> in-facility backup dialysis sessions (furnished on either an inpatient
> or outpatient basis) are furnished to home dialysis patients who are
> covered under the *Prospective Payment System (PPS) base rate*. If a
> backup session is furnished because of a failure to furnish any of the

> of a home dialysis session and reimbursed at the facility's *PPS base
> rate*. If the backup dialysis is furnished by an institution other

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> Although *Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (*CAPD*)* and
> *Continuous Cycling Peritoneal Dialysis (*CCPD*)* patients are home
> dialysis patients, it may be necessary at times to dialyze them
> in-facility as a substitute. In this case, the total weekly

>
> In order to furnish covered CAPD services, a facility must be a
> Medicare approved ESRD facility and must meet additional standards
> established by CMS.
>
> However, in rare instances an ESRD patient may require a combination
> of dialysis techniques, on the same day, in order to achieve
> satisfactory results. In these situations, Medicare pays for both
> types of dialysis services furnished on the same day. Medicare A/B
> MACs (A) determine the medical necessity. In each case the A/B MAC (A)
> obtains medical documentation from the facility that supports the use
> of back-up dialysis with another treatment modality. If a CAPD patient
> frequently requires back-up sessions, the A/B MAC (A)'s medical staff
> may request medical records to determine if this is the appropriate
> mode of treatment to meet medical necessity requirement for payment
> purposes and/or whether a different mode of treatment is more

# - Payment for Hemodialysis Sessions

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> Hemodialysis is typically furnished three times per week in sessions
> of three to five hours duration. Each hemodialysis session equals one
> *PPS base* rate payment. Therefore, three sessions per week is three
> *PPS base* rate payments. Dialysis furnished at this frequency is paid
> without the need for a secondary diagnosis to justify payment. The
> justification must support the medical necessity of the service(s)
> being rendered.

# - Ultrafiltration

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> Ultrafiltration (revenue code 0881) is a process for removing excess
> fluid from the blood through the dialysis membrane by means of
> pressure. It is not a substitute for dialysis.
>
> Ultrafiltration is used in cases where excess fluid cannot be removed
> easily during the regular course of hemodialysis. It is commonly done
> during the first hour or two of hemodialysis on patients who, for
> example, have refractory edema.
>
> **Pre-dialysis Ultrafiltration -** While the need, if any, for
> pre-dialysis ultrafiltration varies from patient to patient, the
> facility's *PPS rate* covers the full range of complicated and
>
> uncomplicated outpatient dialysis treatments. Therefore, no additional
> charge is recognized for pre-dialysis ultrafiltration.
>
> **Separate Ultrafiltration -** Occasionally, medical complications
> require that ultrafiltration be performed at a time other than when a
> dialysis treatment is given, and in these cases an additional payment
> may be made. However, the need for separate ultrafiltration must be
> documented in the medical record and a supporting other diagnosis must
> be included on the claim.

# - Training and Retraining

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> See Pub. 100-02 Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 11, for

> Retraining

A.  General - Occasionally, it is necessary to furnish additional
    > training to an ESRD self-dialysis beneficiary after the initial
    > training course is completed. Retraining sessions are paid under
    > the following conditions:

    -   The patient changes from one mode of dialysis to another, e.g.,
        > from hemodialysis to CAPD;

    -   The patient's home dialysis equipment changes;

    -   The patient's dialysis setting changes;

    -   The patient's dialysis partner changes; or

    -   The patient's medical condition changes e.g., temporary memory
        > loss due to stroke, physical impairment.

> The patient must continue to be an appropriate patient for
> self-dialysis.

B.  Payment Rates - Retraining sessions are reimbursed at the same rate
    as the facility's training rate.

C.  Duplicate Payments **-** No *home dialysis training add-on* payment
    is made for a home dialysis treatment furnished on the same day as a
    retraining session. In the case of a CAPD patient, the facility's
    equivalent CAPD daily rate is not paid on the day(s) of retraining.

> All hemodialysis claims must indicate the most recent Urea Reduction
> Ratio (URR) for the dialysis patient. Code all claims using HCPCS code
> 90999 along with the appropriate G modifier listed in section B.
>
> Claims for dialysis treatments must include the adequacy of

>
> HCPCS code 90999 (unlisted dialysis procedure, inpatient or
> outpatient) must be reported in field location 44 for all bill types
> 72X. The appropriate G-modifier in field location 44 (HCPCS/RATES) is
> used, for patients that received seven or more dialysis treatments in
> a month. Continue to report revenue codes 0820, 0821, 0825, and 0829

B.  **Reporting the Vascular Access for *End Stage Renal Disease
    (ESRD)***

### Hemodialysis Claims

> ESRD claims for hemodialysis with dates of service on or after July 1,
> 2010 must indicate the type of vascular access used for the delivery
> of the hemodialysis at the last hemodialysis session of the month. One
> of the following codes is required to be reported on the latest line

> may be reported on all revenue code 0821 lines at the discretion of
> the provider.
>
> **Note:** Modifier V5 must be entered if a vascular catheter is
> present even if it is not being used for the delivery of the
> hemodialysis. In this instance 2 modifiers should be entered, V5 for
> the vascular catheter and either V6 or V7 for the access that is being
> used for the delivery of hemodialysis.
>
> **Modifier V5** - Any Vascular Catheter (alone or with any other
> vascular access),
>
> **Modifier V6** - Arteriovenous Graft (or other Vascular Access not
> including a vascular catheter in use with two needles)
>
> **Modifier V7** - Arteriovenous Fistula Only (in use with two needles)

C.  **Reporting the Kt/V for ALL *End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD*)
    Claims**

> All *End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)* claims with dates of service on
> or after July 1, 2010 must indicate the applicable Kt/V reading for
> the dialysis patient. The reading result and the date of the reading
> must be reported on the claim using the following claim codes:
>
> Value Code D5 -- Result of last Kt/V reading. For in-center
> hemodialysis patients this is the last reading taken during the
> billing period. For peritoneal dialysis patients and home hemodialysis
> this may be before the current billing period but should be within 4
> months of the claim date of service.

-   **Hemodialysis:** For in-center and home-hemodialysis patients
    prescribed for three or fewer treatments per week, the last Kt/V
    obtained during the month must be reported. Facilities must report
    single pool Kt/V using the preferred National Quality Forum (NQF)
    endorsed methods for deriving the single pool Kt/V value: Daugirdas
    II or Urea Kinetic Modeling (UKM). The reported Kt/V should not
    include residual renal function.

> A value of 8.88 shall be entered on the claim if the situation exists
> that a patient is prescribed and receiving greater than three
> hemodialysis treatments per week for a medically justified and
> documented clinical need. The 8.88 value is not to be used for
> patients who are receiving "extra" treatments for a temporary clinical
> need (e.g. fluid overload). A medical justification must be submitted
> for patients receiving greater than 13 treatments per month.

-   **Peritoneal Dialysis**: When measured the delivered weekly total
    Kt/V (dialytic and residual) should be reported.

> This code is effective and required on all ESRD claims with dates of
> service on or after July 1, 2010. In the event that no Kt/V reading
> was performed providers must report the D5 with a value of 9.99.
>
> Occurrence Code 51 -- Date of last Kt/V reading. For in-center
> hemodialysis patients, this is the date of the last reading taken
> during the billing period. For peritoneal dialysis patients and home
> hemodialysis patients, this date may be before the current billing
> period but should be within 4 months of the claim date of service.
> This code is effective for ESRD claims with dates of service on or
> after July 1, 2010. This code not required when reporting value code
> D5 with a value of 9.99 indicating no Kt/V reading is available for
> reporting or value 8.88 to indicate the patient is prescribed and
> receiving greater than 3 hemodialysis treatments per week for a
> medically justified and documented clinical need.

D.  **Reporting of Infection for *End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)*

# - Lab Services

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 11, for a description
> of lab services included in the *PPS rate.*
>
> Renal dialysis facilities must bill all lab tests provided for the
> treatment of ESRD. This is true whether the tests were provided
> directly or under arrangements with an independent lab. When lab tests
> are billed by providers other than the ESRD facility and the lab test
> is provided for the treatment of ESRD, the claim will be rejected or

# - Drugs Furnished in Dialysis Facilities

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-2021, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> Effective January 1, 2011, section 153b of the MIPPA requires that all
> drugs and biologicals *used in the treatment of ESRD are included in

# - Billing Procedures for Drugs for Facilities

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> The following billing procedures apply to independent and hospital
> based *ESRD*
>
> facilities.
>
> Facilities identify and bill for drugs by HCPCS code, along with
> revenue code 0636, "Drugs Requiring Specific Information." Example
> below includes the HCPCS code and indicates the dosage amount
> specified in the descriptor of that code. Facilities use the units
> field as a multiplier to arrive at the dosage amount.

### EXAMPLE:

> **HCPCS Drug Dosage (lowest denominator) Amount**
>
> J3360 Valium 5 mg \$2.00 Actual dosage, 10 mg
>
> On the bill, the facility shows J3360 and 2 in the units field (2 x 5
> mg = 10 mg). For independent facilities, *A/B MACs (A)* compare the
> price of \$4.00 (2 x \$2.00) to the billed charge and pay the lower,
> subject to coinsurance and deductible. Effective January 1, 2006
> payment is not subject to the lower of charges or fee. All separately
> payable drugs for both hospital-based and independent facilities are
> paid at ASP+6% except vaccines. For information on billing and payment
> for vaccines see section 60.6 of this chapter.
>
> **NOTE:** When the dosage amount is greater than the amount indicated
> for the HCPCS code, the facility rounds up to determine units. When
> the dosage amount is less than the amount indicated for the HCPCS
> code, use one as the unit of measure. In the example above, if the
> dosage were 7 mg, the facility would show 2 in the unit field, if the
> dosage were 3 mg, the facility would show 1 in the unit field.
>
> Facilities bill for supplies used to administer drugs with revenue
> code 0270, "Medical/Surgical Supplies." The number of administrations
> is shown in the units field.

### EXAMPLE:

> Revenue Code Units 0270 3
>
> The number of units for supply codes billed should match the number of
> injections billed on the claim form.
>
> Appropriate HCPCS codes for administration-supply of separately
> billable drugs would include:
>
> A4657: Injection Administration-supply Charge: include the cost of
> alcohol swab, syringe, and gloves. Reimbursement for all ESRD
> facilities is based on a fee of
>
> \$0.50 per unit billed for A4657.
>
> A4913: IV Administration-supply Charge: include the cost of IV
> solution administration set, alcohol swab, syringe, and gloves. This
> code should only be
>
> used when an IV solution set is required for a drug to be given. This
> rate will not be paid for drugs that only require a syringe for
> administration.

# -- Separately Billable ESRD Drugs

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> Effective January 1, 2011, section 153b of the MIPPA requires that all
> drugs and biologicals that are used in the treatment of ESRD be
> provided and billed by the ESRD facility. When a drug or biological is
> billed by providers other than the ESRD facility and the drug or
> biological furnished is designated as a drug or biological that is
> included in the ESRD PPS ( renal dialysis service), the claim will be
> rejected or denied. In the event that a drug or biological generally
> used in the treatment of ESRD was furnished to an ESRD beneficiary for
> reasons other than for the treatment of ESRD, the provider may report
> the drug on *the* claim *with* modifier AY and receive separate
> payment. For claims with dates of service on or after July 1, 2013,
> when these drugs are administered through the dialysate the provider
> must append the modifier JE (Administered via Dialysate).
>
> All drugs reported on the renal dialysis facility claim are considered
> included in the ESRD PPS, unless they are covered by an exception as
> discussed below. The list of drugs and biologicals for consolidated
> billing are designated as [always]{.underline} ESRD-related and
> therefore no separate payment *is* made to ESRD facilities. However,
> CMS has determined that some of these drugs warrant separate payment
> when they are used to treat conditions other than ESRD.

### Exceptions to "Always ESRD Related" Drugs:

> The following drugs have been approved for separate payment
> consideration when billed with the AY modifier attesting to the drug
> not being used for the treatment of ESRD. The ESRD facility is
> required to indicate (in accordance with ICD coding guidelines) the
> diagnosis code for which the drug is indicated.

-   Vancomycin, effective January 1, 2012

-   Daptomycin, effective January 1, 2013

> Items and services subject to the consolidated billing requirements
> for the ESRD PPS can be found on the CMS website at:
> [[http://www.cms.gov/ESRDPayment/50_Consolidated_Billing.asp#TopOfPage]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/ESRDPayment/50_Consolidated_Billing.asp#TopOfPage)
>
> Other drugs and biologicals are separately payable to the dialysis
> facility if the drug was not used for the treatment of ESRD. The
> facility must include the modifier AY to indicate it was not for the
> treatment of ESRD.
>
> Drugs are assigned HCPCS codes. If no HCPCS code is listed for a drug
> (e.g., a new drug) the facility bills using HCPCS code J3490,
> "Unclassified Drugs," and submits documentation identifying the drug.
> To establish a code for the drug, the A/B MAC (A) checks HCPCS to
> verify that there is no acceptable HCPCS code for billing and if a
> code is not found checks with the local A/B MAC (B), which may have a
> code and price that is
>
> appropriate. If no code is found the drug is processed under HCPCS
> code J3490. See Chapter 17 for a complete description of drug pricing.

# -- Facilities Billing for ESRD Drugs and Biologicals Equivalent to Injectable Drugs

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-2021, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> The ESRD PPS includes some *injectable* drugs and biologicals *that
> have oral equivalent* These drugs *should* be reported on the renal
> dialysis facility claim for consideration of outlier payments. For the
> drugs and biologicals *used in the treatment of ESRD* that do not have
> an assigned HCPCS, effective for dates of services on or after January
> 1, 2011, ESRD facilities should bill using revenue code 0250 and
> report the national drug code (NDC). The NDC is reported on the 837i
> claim transaction in loop 2410 line 03.
>
> CMS will price these *oral* drugs based on a plan comparison for
> consideration in the outlier payment. CMS will maintain a list of
> these drug categories by NDC *and will post the list on the CMS.gov
> website*. Payment includes a mean dispensing fee and this amount is
> updated via Recurring Update Notifications. This amount *is* applied
> to each NDC included on the monthly claim. CMS limits 1 dispensing fee
> per NDC per month. Providers should report the quantity in the
> smallest available unit. This is necessary because Medicare is using
> the mean per unit cost in calculating the outlier. For example, if the
> provider reports NDC 00054312041 Calcitriol 1 mcg/ml oral solution
> (15/ml/bottle) and uses the full 15 ml bottle, the quantity is
> reported as 15, not 1. This allows for the most accurate calculation

# - ESA Claims Monitoring Policy

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> Effective for services provided on or after April 1, 2006, Medicare
> has implemented a national claims monitoring policy for ESAs
> administered in Medicare renal dialysis facilities. This policy does
> not apply to claims for ESAs for patients who receive their dialysis
> at home and self-administer their ESA.
>
> While Medicare is not changing its coverage policy on erythropoietin
> use to maintain a target hematocrit level between 30% and 36%, we
> believe the variability in response to ESAs warrants postponing
> requiring monitoring until the hematocrit reaches higher levels. For
> dates of services April 1, 2006, and later, the Centers for Medicare &
> Medicaid Services (CMS) claims monitoring policy applies when the
> hematocrit level exceeds 39.0% or the hemoglobin level exceeds
> 13.0g/dL. This does not preclude the contractors from performing
> medical review at lower levels.
>
> Effective for services provided on or after April 1, 2006, for claims
> reporting hematocrit or hemoglobin levels exceeding the monitoring
> threshold, the dose shall be reduced by 25% over the preceding month.
> Providers may report that a dose reduction did occur in response to
> the reported elevated hematocrit or hemoglobin level by adding a GS
> modifier on the claim. The definition of the GS modifier is defined
> as: "Dosage of ESA has been reduced and maintained in response to
> hematocrit or hemoglobin level." Thus, for claims reporting a
> hematocrit level or hemoglobin level exceeding the monitoring
> threshold without the GS modifier, CMS will reduce the covered dosage
> reported on the claim by 25%. The excess dosage is considered to be
> not reasonable and necessary.
>
> Providers are reminded that the patient's medical records should
> reflect hematocrit/hemoglobin levels and any dosage reduction reported

> The definition of modifier ED is "The hematocrit level has exceeded
> 39.0% (or hemoglobin 1evel has exceeded 13.0g/dL) 3 or more
> consecutive billing cycles immediately prior to and including the

### General

> Parenteral/enteral nutrition (PEN) administered during dialysis may be
> covered under Medicare, but it is not part of the Medicare ESRD
> benefit. Therefore, an ESRD facility or PEN supplier may bill Medicare
> separately for PEN solution if the patient meets all of the
> requirements for PEN coverage. (See Medicare Benefit Policy Manual for
> PEN coverage requirements.) If the ESRD facility bills, it does so as
> a PEN supplier and bills the appropriate DME MAC.

### Staff Time

> The ESRD facility staff time used to administer PEN solution is not
> covered by Medicare, and, therefore, not included in the *ESRD PPS*.
> (PEN is considered a self- administered therapy and generally
> administered in the patient's home.) Since it is not covered under
> Medicare, it is not part of the *ESRD PPS* nor may a facility bill
> Medicare separately for it.

# 80.3 - Calculating Payment for Intermittent Peritoneal Dialysis (IPD)

#### *(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> The value of a typical week of dialysis services generally serves as
> the maximum weekly payment;.
>
> While maintenance IPD is usually accomplished in sessions of 10-12
> hours duration, three times per week, it is sometimes accomplished in
> fewer sessions of longer duration. Regardless of the particular
> regimen used, under the *ESRD PPS* IPD is paid based on a weekly
> equivalence of three ESRD PPS payments rates per week.
>
> IPD in the home is accomplished according to any one of several
> schedules. The total weekly dialysis time varies from 50 to 80 hours.
> For example, home IPD *may b*e furnished every day for 10 hours per
> day, every other day for 15 hours per dialysis day, every night for 8
> hours per night, etc. Regardless of the particular regimen used, under
> the *ESRD PPS* home IPD is paid based on a weekly equivalence of three
> *ESRD PPS* rates per week.
>
> Line item billing is required for all dialysis sessions. For
> intermittent home dialysis the facility submits a separate line item
> for each dialysis session using the dates in the pre- determined plan

> **Under the *ESRD PPS***

#### (*Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21, Implementation:09-07-21)*

> CAPD and CCPD are furnished on a continuous basis, not in discrete
> sessions and, therefore, are paid on a weekly or daily basis, not on a
> per treatment basis. Facilities are required to report the number of

> three times the composite rate for a single hemodialysis treatment.
>
> The equivalent weekly or daily IPD or CAPD/CCPD payment does not
> depend upon the number of exchanges of dialysate fluid per day
> (typically 3-5) or the actual number of days per week that the patient
> undergoes dialysis. The weekly (or daily) rate is based on the
> equivalency of one week of IPD or CAPD/CCPD to one week of
> hemodialysis, regardless of the actual number of dialysis days or
> exchanges in that week.
>
> All home dialysis support services, equipment and supplies necessary
> for home IPD or CAPD/CCPD are included in the *ESRD PPS* payment. No
> support services, equipment or supplies may be paid in addition to the

>
> Line item billing is required for all dialysis sessions. For claims
> billing for Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) and

> ***(Rev. 10640, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:09-07-21,
> Implementation:09-07-21)***

### A. General

> Section 9335(j) of OBRA 1986 requires the Secretary to reduce the
> amount of each payment for each treatment by 50 cents and to allocate
> these amounts to ESRD network activities. This applies to all dialysis
> treatments furnished on or after January 1, 1987 for all treatment
> modalities, including training treatments. All Medicare hospital-based
> and independent ESRD facilities paid under the ESRD PPS are affected.
>
> *The ESRD network reduction is \$.50 per covered treatment when the
> full ESRD PPS rate is applicable. For ESRD claims billing for
> continuous modalities of dialysis performed in the beneficiary's home,
> the ESRD PPS rate is calculated at a daily per diem rate by taking the
> full ESRD PPS rate multiplied by 3 for the weekly allowable total and
> dividing by 7 to provide a daily treatment rate. The ESRD network
> reduction is also calculated at a daily rate by multiplying the \$.50
> by 3 for the weekly total network reduction and dividing by 7 for a
> daily network reduction of \$.21.*
>
> The reduction amount is reported in the Provider Statistics and
> Reimbursement Report (PS&R) and CWF using value code 71 to identify
> monies withheld to fund ESRD networks.
>
> The Medicare payment reduction allocated toward funding the ESRD
> networks for the individual claims will be indicated on the remittance
> record to the facility.
>
> Facilities may not claim the 50-cent reduction as an expense on their
> Medicare cost reports.

### Application of ESRD Network Funding to MSP Claims

> The ESRD offset for network funding on MSP claims will be applied as
> follows:

-   Where another payer, primary to Medicare, pays the claim in full, no
    > ESRD offset is applicable;

-   Where another payer, primary to Medicare, makes a partial payment,
    > the ESRD offset is deducted for each treatment as described in
    > subsection C2 from the Medicare secondary payment; and

-   Where the ESRD offset amount is greater that the secondary payment
    > amount, the entire Medicare secondary payment amount is applied
    > towards the ESRD network funding. No Medicare secondary payment is
    > made to the facility in this situation and no further ESRD offset
    > is applicable. No additional ESRD offset for treatments on this
    > claim will be made against other payments to the facility on the
    > same remittance or on future payments for the same beneficiary.

# - Payment for Immunosuppressive Drugs Furnished to Transplant Patients

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

A.  **General**

> []{#_bookmark65 .anchor}Effective January 1, 1987, Medicare pays for
> FDA approved self-administered immunosuppressive drugs. Generally,
> under this benefit, payment is made for self- administered
> immunosuppressive drugs that are specifically labeled and approved for
> marketing as such by the FDA, as well as those prescription drugs,
> such as prednisone, that are used in conjunction with
> immunosuppressive drugs as part of a therapeutic regimen reflected in
> FDA approved labeling for immunosuppressive drugs. This benefit is
> subject to the Part B deductible and coinsurance provision. There is
> no time limitation on the coverage of these drugs; however, if a
> beneficiary loses Medicare coverage as a result of the transplant, the
> drugs are no longer covered. When the beneficiary reaches the age of
> 65 and becomes entitled, that person can have the drugs covered again.
> The hospital pharmacy must ask the physician to furnish the patient
> with a non-refillable 30- day prescription for the immunosuppressive
> drugs. This is because the dosage of these drugs frequently diminishes
> over a period of time, and it is not uncommon for the physician to
> change the prescription from one drug to another because of the
> patient's needs. Also, these drugs are expensive, and the coinsurance
> liability on unused drugs could be a financial burden to the
> beneficiary. Unless there are special circumstances, the A/B MAC (A)
> and A/B MAC (B) do not consider a supply of drugs in excess of 30 days
> to be reasonable and necessary and limits payment accordingly.

### Payment

> Payment is made on a reasonable cost basis if the beneficiary is the
> outpatient of a participating hospital. In all other cases, payment is
> made on an allowable charge basis.

### FDA Approved Drugs

> Some of the most commonly prescribed immunosuppressive drugs are:

-   Sandimmune (cyclosporine), Sandoz Pharmaceutical (oral or
    > parenteral),

-   Imuran (azathioprine), Burroughs Wellcome Vial (oral),

-   Atgam (antithymocyte/globulin), Upjohn (parenteral); and

-   Orthoclone OKT3 (muromonab - CD3) Ortho Pharmaceutical (parenteral).

> Also covered are prescription drugs used in conjunction with
> immunosuppressive drugs as part of a therapeutic regimen reflected in
> FDA approved labeling for immunosuppressive drugs.
>
> The payment for the drug is limited to the cost of the most frequently
> administered dosage of the drug (adjusted for medical factors as
> determined by the physician).

# - Initial Method for Physician's Services to Maintenance Dialysis Patients

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Under the Initial Method (IM), do not pay for physician's routine
> professional dialysis services. Instead, the dialysis facility's A/B
> MAC (A) pays the dialysis facility for them as part of the facility's
> composite rate. Physician's professional services that are not routine
> professional dialysis services are billed to the contractor and paid
> in the same way as any other Medicare covered physician professional
> service.

### For the physician to be paid under the IM, the following requirements must be met:

> All physicians of the facility must choose the IM with respect to all
> of the patients treated at the facility and all of the facility's
> Method I home dialysis patients. (See §70.1 for a description of
> Method I). All of the facility's physicians must file a written
> statement with their A/B MAC (B) and the facility's A/B MAC (A) to
> this effect. For example:
>
> The physicians practicing at dialysis facility are listed below. The
> signature of each physician indicates the physician's election
>
> to be paid for their routine professional dialysis services under the
> Initial Method. This election is effective for services furnished
> beginning with the second month after the month in which this
> statement is filed with the A/B MAC (B) and the facility's A/B MAC
> (A).
>
> This written statement must be signed and dated by each physician.

### The physician may bill the A/B MAC (B) only those physician's professional services that are not routine professional dialysis services. (See paragraph 3 below).

> The election of the IM is effective for services furnished beginning
> with the second calendar month after the month in which all the
> physicians of a facility elect it. A physician may terminate the
> election by written notice to the A/B MAC (B) and to the facility's
> A/B MAC (A) that the physician thereby terminates the IM. If the A/B
> MAC
>
> \(B\) and the A/B MAC (A) receive the termination notice on or before
> November 1, it is effective the following January 1. If the A/B MAC
> (B) or the A/B MAC (A) receives it after November 1, it is effective
> January 1 of the second year after the calendar year in which the
> notice of termination is received. Note that if the IM is terminated
> by one physician, it is thereby terminated for all physicians at the
> same facility with respect to the patients treated through that
> facility.

3.  ### Definitions

    A.  **Administrative Services**

> Physician services that are differentiated from routine professional
> services and other physician services. They include supervision, as
> described in the definition of "supervision of staff," are not related
> directly to the care of an individual patient and are supportive of
> the facility as a whole and of benefit to patients in general.
> Examples of administrative services include supervision of staff,
> staff training, participation in staff conferences and in the
> management of the facility, and advising staff on the procurement of
> supplies.

### Dialysis Session

> The period of time that begins when the patient arrives at the
> facility and ends when the patient departs from the facility. In the
> case of home dialysis, the period begins when the patient prepares for
> dialysis and generally ends when the patient is disconnected from the
> machine. In this context, a dialysis facility includes only those
> parts of the building used as a facility. It does not include any
> areas used as a physician's private office.

### Medical Direction

> Routine professional service that entails substantial direct
> involvement and the physical presence of the physician in the delivery
> of services directly to the patient.

### Routine Professional Services

> Physicians' services furnished during a dialysis session and all
> services listed under "Types of routine professional services" that:

-   Are personally furnished by a physician to an individual patient.

-   Contribute directly to the diagnosis or treatment of an individual
    > patient.

-   Ordinarily must be performed by a physician.

### Supervision of Staff

> Administrative services that do not necessarily require the physician
> to be present at the dialysis session. It is a general activity
> primarily concerned with monitoring performance of and giving guidance
> to other health care personnel (such as nurses and dialysis
> technicians) who deliver services to patients.

### Types of Routine Professional Services

> Routine professional services include at least the following services
> when medically appropriate:

-   Visits to the patient during dialysis, and in conjunction with
    > review of laboratory test results,

-   Nurses' notes and any other medical documentation, as a basis for:

    -   Adjustment of the patient's medication, diet or the dialysis
        > procedure;

    -   Prescription of medical supplies; and

    -   Evaluation of the patient's psychosocial status and the
        > appropriateness of the modality,

    -   Medical direction of staff in delivering services to a patient
        > during a dialysis session, and

    -   Pre-dialysis and post-dialysis examinations or examinations that
        > could have been furnished on a pre-dialysis or post-dialysis
        > basis.

### Services Included in Monthly Capitation Payment

> The following physician services are included in the MCP:

-   Assessment of the need for a specified diet and the need for
    > nutritional supplementation for the control of chronic renal
    > failure. Specification of the quantity of total protein, high
    > biologic protein, sodium, potassium, and amount of fluids to be
    > allowed during a given time period. For diabetic patients with
    > chronic renal failure, the prescription usually specifies the
    > number of calories in the diet.

-   Assessment of which mode(s) of chronic dialysis (types of
    > hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) are suitable for a given
    > patient and recommendation of the type(s) of therapy for a given
    > patient.

-   Assessment and determination of which type of dialysis access is
    > best suited for a given patient and arrangement for creation of
    > dialysis access.

-   Assessment of whether the patient meets preliminary criteria as a
    > renal transplant candidate and presentation of this assessment to
    > the patient and family.

-   Prescription of the parameters of intradialytic management. For
    > chronic hemodialysis therapies, this includes the type of dialysis
    > access, the type and amount of anticoagulant to be employed, blood
    > flow rates, dialysate flow rate, ultrafiltration rate, dialysate
    > temperature, type of dialysate (acetate versus bicarbonate) and
    > composition of the electrolytes in the dialysate, size of
    > hemodialyzer (surface area) and composition of the dialyzer
    > membrane (conventional versus high flux), duration and frequency
    > of treatments, the type and frequency of measuring indices of
    > clearance, and intradialytic medications to

> be administered. For chronic peritoneal dialysis therapies, this
> includes the type of peritoneal dialysis, the volume of dialysate,
> concentration of dextrose in the dialysate, electrolyte composition of
> the dialysate, duration of each exchange, and addition of medication
> to the dialysate, such as heparin, and the type and frequency of
> measuring indices of clearance. For diabetics, the quantity of insulin
> to be added to each exchange is prescribed.

-   Assessment of whether the patient has significant renal
    > failure-related anemia, determination of the etiology(ies) for the
    > anemia based on diagnostic tests, and prescription of therapy for
    > correction of the anemia, such as vitamins, oral or parenteral
    > iron, and hormonal therapy such as erythropoietin.

-   Assessment of whether the patient has hyperparathyroidism and/or
    > renal osteodystrophy secondary to chronic renal failure and
    > prescription of appropriate therapy, such as calcium and phosphate
    > binders for control of hyperphosphatemia. Based upon assessment of
    > parahormone levels, serum calcium levels, and evaluation for the
    > presence of metabolic bone disease, the physician determines
    > whether oral or parenteral therapy with vitamin D or its analogs
    > is indicated and prescribes the appropriate therapy. Based upon
    > assessment and diagnosis of bone disease, the physician may
    > prescribe specific chelation therapy with deferoxamine and the use
    > of hemoperfusion for removal of aluminum and the chelation.

-   Assessment of whether the patient has dialysis-related arthropathy
    > or neuropathy and adjustment of the patient's prescription
    > accordingly. Referral of the patient for any additional needed
    > specialist evaluation and management of these end- organ problems.

-   Assessment of whether the patient has fluid overload resulting from
    > renal failure and establishment of an estimated "ideal (dry)
    > weight." The physician determines the need for fluid removal
    > independent of the dialysis prescription and implements these
    > measures when indicated.

-   Determination of the need for and prescription of antihypertensive
    > medications and their timing relative to dialysis when the patient
    > is hypertensive in spite of correction of fluid overload.

-   Periodic review of the dialysis records to ascertain whether the
    > patient is receiving the prescribed amount of dialysis and
    > ordering of indices of clearance, such as urea kinetics, in order
    > to ascertain whether the dialysis prescription is producing
    > adequate dialysis. If the indices of clearance suggest that the
    > prescription requires alteration, the physician orders changes in
    > the hemodialysis prescription, such as blood flow rate, dialyzer
    > surface area, dialysis frequency, and/or dialysis duration (length
    > of treatment). For peritoneal dialysis patients, the physician may
    > order changes in the volume of dialysate, dextrose concentration
    > of the dialysate, and duration of the exchanges.

-   Periodic visits (at least one per month) to the patient during
    > dialysis to ascertain whether the dialysis is working well and
    > whether the patient is tolerating the procedure well
    > (physiologically and psychologically). During these visits, the
    > physician determines whether alteration in any aspect of a given
    > patient's prescription is indicated, such as changes in the
    > estimate of the patient's dry weight. Review of the treatment with
    > the nurse or technician performing the therapy is also included.
    > The frequency of these visits will vary depending upon the
    > patient's medical status, complicating conditions, and other
    > determinants.

-   Performance of periodic physical assessments, based upon the
    > patient's clinical stability, in order to determine the necessity
    > for alterations in various aspects of the patient's prescription.
    > Similarly, the physician reviews the results of periodic
    > laboratory testing in order to determine the need for alterations
    > in the patient's prescription, such as changes in the amount and
    > timing of phosphate binders or dose of erythropoietin.

-   Periodic assessment of the adequacy and function of the patient's
    > dialysis access appropriate tests and antibiotic therapy.

-   Interpretations of the following tests:

    -   Bone mineral density studies (CPT codes 76070, 76075, 78350, and
        > 78351);

    -   Noninvasive vascular diagnostic studies of hemodialysis access
        > (CPT codes 93925, 93926, 93930, 93931, and 93990);

    -   Nerve conduction studies (CPT codes 95900, 95903, 95904, 95925,

> 95926, 95927, 95934, 95935, and 95936);

-   Electromyography studies (CPT codes 95860, 95861, 95863, 95864,

> 95867, 95867, 95869, and 95872).

-   Periodic review and update of the patient's short-term and long-term
    care plans with staff.

-   Coordination and direction of the care of patients by other
    > professional staff, such as dieticians and social workers.

-   Certification of the need for items and services such as durable
    > medical equipment and home health care services. Care plan
    > oversight services described by CPT code 99375 are included in the
    > MCP and may not be separately reported.

### Services Excluded from Monthly Capitation Payment

> The following physician services furnished to the physician's ESRD
> patients are excluded from the MCP and should be paid in accordance
> with the physician fee schedule:

1.  Administration of hepatitis B vaccine.

2.  Surgical services such as:

    -   Temporary or permanent hemodialysis catheter placement;

    -   Temporary or permanent peritoneal dialysis catheter placement;

    -   Repair of existing dialysis accesses;

    -   Placement of catheter(s) for thrombolytic therapy;

    -   Thrombolytic therapy (systemic, regional, or access catheter
        > only; hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis);

    -   Thrombectomy of clotted cannula;

    -   Arthrocentesis;

    -   Bone marrow aspiration; and

    -   Bone marrow biopsy.

3.  Interpretation of tests that have a professional component such as:

    -   Electrocardiograms (12 lead, Holter monitor, stress tests,
        > etc.);

    -   Echocardiograms;

    -   24-hour blood pressure monitor;

    -   Biopsies; and

    -   Spirometry and complete pulmonary function tests.

4.  Complete evaluation for renal transplantation. While the physician
    assessment of whether the patient meets preliminary criteria as a
    renal transplant candidate is included under the MCP, the complete
    evaluation for renal transplantation is excluded from the MCP

5.  Evaluation of potential living transplant donors.

6.  The training of patients to perform home hemodialysis, self
    hemodialysis, and the various forms of self peritoneal dialysis.

7.  Non-renal related physician's services. These services may be
    furnished by the physician providing renal care or by another
    physician. They may not be incidental to services furnished during a
    dialysis session or office visit necessitated by the renal
    condition. The physician must provide documentation that the illness
    is not related to the renal condition and that the added visits are
    required. The contractor's medical staff determines whether
    additional reimbursement is warranted for treatment of the unrelated
    illness. For example, the medical management of diabetes mellitus
    that is not related to the dialysis or furnished during a dialysis
    session is excluded.

8.  Covered physician services furnished to hospital inpatients.

9.  All physician services that antedate the initiation of outpatient
    dialysis.

10. Covered physician services furnished by another physician when the
    patient is not available to receive the outpatient services as
    usual; for example, when the patient is traveling out of town.

    1.  # - Payment for ESRD-Related Services Under the Monthly Capitation Payment (Center Based Patients)

### (Rev. 2269, Issued: 08-05-11, Effective: 01-01-11, Implementation: 11-07-11)

> Physicians and practitioners managing center based patients on
> dialysis are paid a monthly rate for most outpatient dialysis-related
> physician services furnished to a Medicare ESRD beneficiary. The
> payment amount varies based on the number of visits provided within
> each month and the age of the ESRD beneficiary. Under this
> methodology, separate codes are billed for providing one visit per
> month, two to three visits per month and four or more visits per
> month. The lowest payment amount applies when a physician provides one
> visit per month; a higher payment is provided for two to three visits
> per month. To receive the highest payment amount, a physician or
> practitioner would have to provide at least four ESRD-related visits
> per month. The MCP is reported once per month for services performed
> in an outpatient setting that are related to the patients' ESRD.
>
> The physician or practitioner who provides the complete assessment,
> establishes the patient's plan of care, and provides the ongoing
> management is the physician or practitioner who submits the bill for
> the monthly service.

a.  Month defined.

> For purposes of billing for physician and practitioner ESRD related
> services, the term 'month' means a calendar month. The first month the
> beneficiary begins dialysis treatments is the date the dialysis
> treatments begin through the end of the calendar month. Thereafter,
> the term 'month' refers to a calendar month.

b.  Determination of the age of beneficiary.

> The beneficiary's age at the end of the month is the age of the
> patient for determining the appropriate age related ESRD-related
> services code.

c.  Qualifying Visits Under the MCP

-   General policy.

> Visits must be furnished face-to-face by a physician, clinical nurse

-   Visits furnished by another physician or practitioner (who is not
    > the MCP physician or practitioner).

> The MCP physician or practitioner may use other physicians or
> qualified nonphysician practitioners to provide some of the visits
> during the month. The MCP physician or practitioner does not have to
> be present when these other physicians or practitioners provide

# - Payment for Managing Patients on Home Dialysis

### (Rev. 2269, Issued: 08-05-11, Effective: 01-01-11, Implementation: 11-07-11)

> Physicians and practitioners managing ESRD patients who dialyze at
> home are paid a single monthly rate based on the age of the
> beneficiary. The MCP physician (or practitioner) must furnish at least
> one face-to-face patient visit per month for the home dialysis MCP
> service. Documentation by the MCP physician (or practitioner) should

# - Patients Who Switch Modalities (Center to Home and Vice Versa)

### (Rev. 1999, Issued: 07-09-10, Effective: 01-01-11, Implementation: 01-03-11)

> If a home dialysis patient receives dialysis in a dialysis center or

-   Home dialysis patients (less than full month);

-   Transient patients -- Patients traveling away from home (less than
    full month);

-   Partial month where there was one or more face-to-face visits
    without a complete assessment of the patient and the patient was
    either hospitalized before a complete assessment was furnished,
    dialysis stopped due to death, or the patient had a transplant.

-   Patients who have a permanent change in their MCP physician during
    > the month.

> The ESRD-related services (less than full month), per day HCPCS codes

# - Guidelines for Physician or Practitioner Billing \-- (Per Diem)

### (Rev. 3311, Issued: 08-06-15, Effective: 01-01-15, Implementation: 09-08-15)

A.  **Home dialysis, transient patient and partial month**

> When submitting claims for ESRD-related services (less than full
> month) per day, the physician or practitioner should specify the
> number of days he or she was responsible for the beneficiary's
> outpatient ESRD-related services during the month.
>
> Only one code should be used to report the daily management of home
> dialysis patients, transient patients, and for partial month
> scenarios. For example, if a home dialysis patient receives dialysis
> at home for two weeks and is hospitalized for the remainder of the
> month, then 14 units of the age appropriate ESRD-related per day code
> is billed. The MCP service is not billed.
>
> For transient patients, the physician or practitioner responsible for
> the transient patient's ESRD-related care should bill the appropriate
> ESRD-related services, per day code. Only the physician or
> practitioner responsible for the traveling ESRD patient's care is
> permitted to bill for ESRD-related services using the per diem
> ESRD-related services HCPCS codes.
>
> For home dialysis patients (less than full month) if the MCP physician
> or practitioner furnishes a complete monthly assessment of the ESRD
> beneficiary and at least one face- to-face patient visit during the
> month, he or she should bill for the age appropriate home dialysis MCP
> service. For example, if a home dialysis patient was hospitalized
> during the month and at least one face-to-face outpatient visit and
> complete monthly assessment was furnished, the MCP physician or
> practitioner should bill for the full home dialysis MCP service.
>
> For partial month scenarios resulting from hospitalization, kidney
> transplant, or the patient expired, if the MCP physician or
> practitioner furnished a complete monthly assessment of the patient,
> he or she should bill using the age appropriate MCP service that
> reflects the number of visits furnished during the month.
>
> Example #1: An ESRD beneficiary was hospitalized on the tenth through
> the twentieth day of the month. On the third day of the month, the MCP
> physician or practitioner furnished a face-to-face visit including a
> complete assessment and a subsequent outpatient visit on the
> twenty-fifth day of the month. While the patient was hospitalized, an
> inpatient ESRD-related visit was furnished.
>
> In this scenario, the MCP physician or practitioner may bill for the
> appropriate outpatient MCP service based on the age of the beneficiary
> and number of visits furnished during the month. The physician or
> practitioner who furnished the inpatient visit may bill for the
> appropriate inpatient ESRD-related service code.
>
> Example #2: An ESRD beneficiary vacationing in Florida is away from
> his or her home dialysis site from August fifteenth through September
> seventh. On August tenth, the MCP physician furnishes a face-to-face
> visit. For the month of September, the MCP physician furnishes a visit
> on the ninth and a subsequent visit on the twenty-fifth of the month.
> A physician in Florida is responsible for the beneficiary's
> ESRD-related care from August fifteenth through September seventh.
>
> In this scenario, the physician or practitioner responsible for the
> transient patient's ESRD-related care bills sixteen units of the age
> appropriate ESRD-related services for dialysis less than full month,
> per day code for the month of August and seven units of the per day
> code for the month of September. The MCP physician bills the MCP
> service with one visit for the month of August and the MCP service
> with two to three visits for the month of September.
>
> If the transient beneficiary is under the care of a physician or
> practitioner other than his or her regular MCP physician for an entire
> calendar month, the physician or practitioner responsible for the
> transient patient's ESRD-related care must furnish a complete
> assessment and bill for ESRD-related services under the MCP.

### Patient has a permanent change in their MCP physician during the month

> ESRD-related services (less than full month) per day HCPCS codes
> should be billed in situations where an ESRD beneficiary permanently
> changes their MCP physician during the month. For example, the new MCP
> physician has the ongoing responsibility for the evaluation and
> management of the patient's ESRD-related care and is not part of the
> same group practice or an employee of the first MCP physician. The new
> MCP physician should use the appropriate per diem HCPCS code when
> submitting claims for ESRD- related services for the remainder of the
> month, when the first MCP physician furnishes a complete assessment of
> the beneficiary during the month.
>
> If the first MCP physician does not furnish a complete assessment of
> the patient during the month the patient permanently changes their MCP
> physician, the new MCP physician may bill for the appropriate MCP
> service based on the age of the patient and number of visits furnished
> and the first MCP physician may bill the appropriate per day HCPCS
> code as discussed above.
>
> Example: An ESRD patient residing in Virginia Beach, Virginia for the
> first 20 days of the month, moves to Atlanta, Georgia. As a result, a
> different physician or practitioner is now responsible for the ongoing
> management of the beneficiary's ESRD-related care.
>
> Both the first and second MCP physician furnishes a visit with a
> complete assessment of
>
> the patient and establishes a monthly plan of care. In this situation,
> the first MCP physician should bill the MCP service that reflects the
> number of visits he or she furnished during the month and the second
> MCP physician should bill the age appropriate per day ESRD-related
> services code. Thereafter, the new MCP physician would bill for the
> MCP service.
>
> In this example, if the first MCP physician does not provide a
> complete assessment of the patient, he or she should bill 20 units of
> the per day ESRD-related services code, but may not bill for the MCP
> during the month the beneficiary permanently changes his or her MCP
> physician. The second MCP physician may bill for the MCP service after
> furnishing a complete monthly assessment of the ESRD beneficiary that
> includes establishing the patient's plan of care and at least one
> face-to-face visit.

>
> In processing claims reimbursed under this method, contractors must
> assure that:

-   Only one monthly payment is made for any renal disease patient per
    > month;

-   The MCP payment is made after the month has passed; i.e., do not pay
    > the MCP in advance of the services actually furnished;

-   The payment amount is based on the age of the beneficiary and the
    > number of visits furnished during a calendar month (center based
    > patients);

-   Duplicate charges billed as a duplicate MCP or as separate charges
    > for services covered by the monthly payment are denied;

-   Where several physicians or practitioners form a team to provide the
    > monthly continuity of services to a group of patients, make only
    > one monthly payment for each patient.

-   Concurrent services by another physician or practitioner who is part
    > of the MCP practice team are covered and reimbursed separately
    > only for services not included in the MCP (e.g. a visit not
    > related to managing the patients ESRD); and

# - Payment for Physician's Services Furnished to Dialysis Inpatients

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> The following instructions cover physicians services to inpatients for
> all types of dialysis patients; e.g., hemodialysis, intermittent
> peritoneal dialysis (IPD), continuous ambulatory
>
> peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis
> (CCPD). Note that the hospitalization need not be related to dialysis.
>
> Payment is made on the claim only if the place of service on the
> claims is inpatient hospital. See §170 for proper HCPCS coding.

# - Determining Whether Physician Services Furnished on Day of Dialysis

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> If the patient is admitted to a hospital to receive dialysis for a
> reason not related to the patient's ESRD condition (e.g., there was no
> space available in the dialysis unit), the dialysis is covered as an
> outpatient service. In this case, A/B MACs (B) do not pay separately
> for any physicians' ESRD services because these services are covered
> under the physician's MCP or under the add-on to the hospital's
> composite rate for physicians under the initial method. (See §130.1
> for a description of the initial method.)

# - Physicians' Services Furnished on Day of Dialysis

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-15062.1

> Supervision or direction of a dialysis treatment by a physician does
> not ordinarily meet the requirements for physicians' services and,
> therefore, is not paid for as such under the fee schedule. However,
> physicians are responsible for the medical care and treatment of the
> dialysis patients. Physicians' services furnished to those patients
> that meet the requirements and are medically necessary are covered.
> The hospital medical record must document the services furnished and
> the medical reasons for them.
>
> Generally, claims from the physician receiving a procedure code
> payment for additional services furnished to the same patient on the
> day of dialysis must be reviewed by medical staff prior to payment.
> Follow §170.B for dialysis and evaluation and management services
> performed on the same day.
>
> Payment in addition to the procedure code payment is made only if the
> service is not related to the treatment of the patient's ESRD, and the
> service was not, and could not have been, furnished during the
> dialysis treatment. However, an exception to this rule is physicians'
> surgical services; e.g., catheter insertion. Physicians' surgical
> services are generally billed under the appropriate procedure code for
> payment. If more than one physician furnishes care to the same
> dialysis patient, follow the usual coverage rules on concurrent care.

# - Physicians' Services Furnished on Non-Dialysis Days

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Physicians' services furnished on non-dialysis days are coded and paid
> under the same rules as any other physicians' services when non-renal
> related services are furnished.
>
> Renal-related services may also be paid if the physician chooses to
> prorate the MCP payment. Generally, these services are the physicians'
> hospital visits and are coded and paid as such.

# - Requirements for Payment

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

A.  **General**

> When paying for physicians' services furnished to dialysis inpatients,
> whether they are ESRD patients or acute dialysis patients, there are
> several factors to consider.

-   The payment must be for covered physicians' services;

-   The services must be medically necessary; and

-   The payment for the services must be reasonably related to the
    > nature of the services actually furnished.

### Physicians' Services - Criteria for Procedure Codes

> The procedure code covers the full range of physicians' renal-related
> services furnished during an inpatient dialysis treatment.
>
> In order to be paid on the basis of a procedure code, the physician
> must have been physically present with the patient at some time during
> the course of the dialysis, and the medical record (e.g., the
> physician's progress note or the nurse's notes in the patient's
> hospital medical record) must document this.
>
> If the physician visits the dialysis inpatient on a dialysis day, but
> not during the dialysis treatment, do not pay the physician on the
> basis of a procedure code. The nature of these services is the same as
> physicians' services furnished to any inpatient during a hospital
> visit. Therefore, use the same hospital visit codes that apply to any
> other physicians treating hospital inpatients.
>
> Physicians' services furnished to patients who are dialyzed as
> inpatients because there is no room in the outpatient dialysis units
> are covered under the MCP, and physicians are not paid amounts in
> addition to or in place of the MCP.
>
> Effective January 1, 1995, all evaluation and management services
> provided on the same day as inpatient dialysis codes should be denied
> without review with the exception of CPT codes 99221-99223,
> 99251-99255, and 99238. These codes may be billed with modifier "-25"
> and reviewed for possible allowance if the evaluation and management
> service is unrelated to the treatment of ESRD and was not and could
> not have been furnished during the dialysis treatment.

### Peritoneal Dialysis

> Peritoneal dialysis is typically furnished in extended periods. For
> example, CAPD is continuous, and the patient may actually be dialyzed
> seven days per week. IPD may be furnished in extended periods of 30
> hours or more. The fact that a patient is dialyzed continuously for an
> extended period does not justify payment in excess of the average
> weekly allowance made for hemodialysis services. Payment in excess of
> this amount is made only if it is determined that the same kind and
> intensity of physicians' hemodialysis treatment beyond the number
> ordinarily furnished in a 7-day period, and the patient's condition
> was similar to that of a hemodialysis patient who would have required
> these additional services.

# 170 - Billing Physician Dialysis Services (codes 90935 - 90999) and Related Payment

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Except when the MCP applies claims for physicians' inpatient dialysis
> services furnished to ESRD or acute dialysis patients are processed
> using physicians' inpatient dialysis services procedure codes 90935,
> 90937, 90945, and 90947. All A/B MACs (B) must use these codes for
> these services.
>
> A/B MACs (B) make payment on the basis of ESRD procedure codes, i.e.,
> codes 90935, 90937, 90945, or 90947, only if the place of service on
> the claim is inpatient hospital.
>
> This is because all physicians' outpatient renal-related services are
> included in payment made under the monthly capitation payment.
>
> A. ESRD Monthly Capitation Payments
>
> Effective January 1, 1995, monthly capitation payments are made under
> the physician fee schedule. For their adult patients, physicians may
> bill either the monthly code (CPT code 90921) or the daily code (CPT
> code 90922) with units that represent the number of days in a single
> month, but may not bill both.
>
> To bill for a month of services for pediatric patients, providers
> should bill the appropriate monthly code (CPT codes 90919, 90920, or
> 90921). To bill for less than a month of service, providers bill the
> appropriate daily code (CPT codes 90923-90925) and units that
> represent the number of days. Providers may bill either the monthly
> code or the daily code, but not both. Since billing is done at the
> conclusion of the month, the patient's age at the end of month is the
> age of the patient for billing purposes.
>
> B - Inpatient and Outpatient Dialysis Services On Same Date As An
> Evaluation and Management Service
>
> CPT codes 90935 and 90937 are used to report inpatient ESRD
> hemodialysis and outpatient hemodialysis performed on non-ESRD
> patients (e.g., patients in acute renal failure requiring a brief
> period of dialysis prior to recovery). CPT codes 90945 and 90947
>
> are used to report all non-hemodialysis procedures. All four of these
> codes include payment for any evaluation and management services
> related to the patients renal disease that are provided on the same
> date as the dialysis service. Therefore, payment for all evaluation
> and management services is bundled into the payment for 90935, 90937,
> 90945, and 90947, except for the following evaluation and management
> services which may be reported on the same date as a dialysis service
> with the use of the --25 modifier and they are significant and
> separately identifiable and met any medical necessity requirements:

# 180 - Noninvasive Studies for ESRD Patients - Facility and Physician Services

### (Rev. 3650, Issued: 11-10-16, Effective: 02-10-17, Implementation: 02-10-17)

> For Medicare coverage of noninvasive vascular studies, see the
> Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 11.
>
> For dialysis to take place there must be a means of access so that the
> exchange of waste products may occur. As part of the dialysis
> treatment, ESRD facilities are responsible for monitoring access, and
> when occlusions occur, either declot the access or refer the patient
> for appropriate treatment. Procedures associated with monitoring
> access involve taking venous pressure, aspirating thrombus, observing
> elevated recirculation time, reduced urea reduction ratios, or
> collapsed shunt, etc. All such procedures are covered under the
> composite rate.
>
> ESRD facilities may not monitor access through noninvasive vascular
> studies such as duplex and Doppler flow scans and bill separately for
> these procedures. Noninvasive vascular studies are not covered as a
> separately billable service if used to monitor a patient's vascular
> access site.
>
> Medicare pays for the technical component of the procedure in the
> composite payment rate.
>
> Where there are signs and symptoms of vascular access problems,
> Doppler flow studies may be used as a means to obtain diagnostic
> information to permit medical intervention to address the problem.
> Doppler flow studies may be considered medically necessary in the
> presence of signs or symptoms of possible failure of the ESRD
> patient's vascular access site, and when the results are used in
> determining the clinical course of the treatment for the patient.
>
> The only Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) billing code for
> noninvasive vascular testing of a hemodialysis access site is 93990.
> A/B MACs (B) must deny separate billing of the technical component of
> this code if it is performed on any patient for whom the ESRD
> composite rate for dialysis is being paid, unless there is appropriate
> medical indication of the need for a Doppler flow study.
>
> When a dialysis patient exhibits signs and symptoms of compromise to
> the vascular access site, Doppler flow studies may provide diagnostic
> information that will determine the appropriate medical intervention.
> Medicare considers a Doppler flow study medically necessary when the
> beneficiary's dialysis access site manifests signs or symptoms
> associated with vascular compromise, and when the results of this test
> are necessary to determine the clinical course of treatment.
>
> Examples supporting the medical necessity for Doppler flow studies
> include:

a.  Elevated dynamic venous pressure \>200mm HG when measured during
    dialysis with the blood pump set on a 200cc/min.,

b.  Access recirculation of 12 percent or greater,

c.  An otherwise unexplained urea reduction ration \<60 oercebtm abd

d.  An access with a palpable "water hammer" pulse on examination,
    (which implies venous outflow obstruction).

> Unless the documentation is provided supporting the necessity of more
> than one study, Medicare will limit payment to either a Doppler flow
> study or an arteriogram (fistulogram, venogram), but not both.
>
> An example of when both studies may be clinically necessary is when a
> Doppler flow study demonstrates reduced flow (blood flow rate less
> than 800cc/min or a decreased flow of 25 percent or greater from
> previous study) and the physician requires an arteriogram to further
> define the extent of the problem. The patient's medical record(s) must
> provide documentation supporting the need for more than one imaging
> study.
>
> This policy is applicable to claims from ESRD facilities and all other
> sources, such as independent diagnostic testing facilities, and
> hospital outpatient departments.
>
> A/B MACs (B) shall develop LMRP for Doppler flow studies if this
> service meets the criteria listed in the Medicare Program Integrity
> Manual, Chapter 1. This provides guidance to contractors on the scope,
> purpose, and meaning of LMRP.
>
> The professional component of the procedure is included in the monthly
> capitation payment (MCP) (See §140 above.) The professional component
> should be denied for code 93990 if billed by the MCP physician.
> Medically necessary services that are included or bundled into the MCP
> (e.g., test interpretations) are separately payable when furnished by
> physicians other than the MCP physician.
>
> The contractor shall use the following remittance advice messages and
> associated codes when rejecting/denying claims under this policy. This
> CARC/RARC combination is compliant with CAQH CORE Business Scenario
> Four.
>
> Group Code: CO CARC: 24 RARC: N/A MSN:16.32
>
> Billing for monitoring of hemodialysis access using CPT codes for
> noninvasive vascular studies other than 93990 is considered a
> misrepresentation of the service actually provided and contractors
> will consider this action for fraud investigation. They will conduct
