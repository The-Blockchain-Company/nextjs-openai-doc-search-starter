## - General Guidelines for Processing Home Health Agency (HHA)

> **Claims**

### (Rev. 2977, Issued; 06-20-14, Effective: 09-23-14; ICD-10: Upon Implementation of ICD-10, Implementation: 09-23-14; ICD-10: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> This chapter, in general, describes billing and claims processing
> requirements that are applicable only to home health agencies. For
> general bill processing requirements refer to the appropriate other
> chapters in the Medicare Claims Processing Manual. For a description
> of home health coverage policies see Pub. 100-02, Medicare Benefit
> Policy Manual, chapter 7.

A.  Where and How to Bill

> Institutional providers, including home health agencies, use one of
> two institutional claim formats to bill Original Medicare. In the
> great majority of cases, these providers are required to use the
> electronic HIPAA standard institutional claim transaction, the 837
> institutional claim. The minority of providers that are eligible for
> an exception to electronic claim submission use the paper Form
> CMS-1450, also known as the UB-04.
>
> Such claim forms are submitted to certain Medicare Administrative
> Contractors (A/B MACs (HHH)) with jurisdiction over home health and
> hospice claims. Some home health agencies may also become approved as
> Durable Medical Equipment (DME) suppliers, in which case they would
> submit bills for DMEPOS services to the DME MACs on a professional
> claim format (the 837professional or paper Form CMS-1500).
>
> References to the claim form in this chapter refer to the paper Form
> CMS-1450 unless otherwise noted. However, the instructions regarding
> specific data requirements apply also to the electronic 837
> institutional claim.

B.  Services to Include on the Claim for Home Health Benefits

> Effective for all services provided on or after October 1, 2000, all
> services under the home health plan of care, except the following, are
> included in the home health PPS payment amount. Services that may be
> included in the plan of care but excluded from the HH prospective
> payment system (HH PPS) are:

-   Osteoporosis drugs (although the cost of administration is within
    > the PPS rate); and

-   Durable medical equipment, including prosthetics, orthotics, and
    > oxygen

> The DMEPOS services may be included on type of bill (TOB) 032x for the
> home health benefits, and are paid in addition to the PPS payment. See
> §20 for additional instructions regarding competitively bid DME.
> Osteoporosis drugs must be billed on type of bill 034x.
>
> Other services not under an HH plan of care provided by an HHA are
> billed using type of bill 034x. See §90 for guidance as to the payment
> methodologies used by Medicare to reimburse these services, and see
> §40.4 in this chapter for information on deductible and coinsurance.

> 1997 and legislative requirements were modified in various subsequent
> laws. Section 1895 of the Social Security Act contains current law
> regarding HH PPS.
>
> The initial implementation of the HH PPS was effective for dates of
> service on and after October 1, 2000. Refinements to the case-mix
> system of the HH PPS system were for episodes of care beginning on and
> after January 1, 2008. Effective for periods of care beginning on and
> after January 1, 2020, the original HH PPS system was updated to apply
> the Patient-Driven Grouping Model. Home health Notices of Admission
> (NOAs) are required for periods of care beginning on and after January
> 1, 2022.
>
> The sections that follow describe billing for services on or after
> January 1, 2022.

## - Number, Duration, and Claims Submission of HH PPS Periods of Care

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> The beneficiary can be covered for an unlimited number of
> nonoverlapping periods of care. For periods of care beginning on or
> after January 1, 2020, the duration of a period is 30 days. Periods of
> care may be shorter than 30 days.
>
> For example, a period may end earlier than the 30^th^ day in the case
> of a transfer to another HHA, or a discharge and readmission to the
> same HHA, and payment is pro-rated for these shortened periods, in
> which more home care is delivered in the same period.
>
> Claims for periods may be submitted prior to the 30^th^ day if the
> beneficiary has been discharged and treatment goals have been met,
> though payment will not be pro-rated unless more home health care is
> subsequently billed in the same period.
>
> Other claims for overlapping periods may also be submitted prior to
> the end of that period if the beneficiary has been discharged, dies or
> is transferred to another HHA. In transfer cases payment for the
> period of care will be prorated.
>
> The initial period begins with the first service delivered under that
> plan of care. A second subsequent period of continuous care would
> start on the first day after the initial period was completed.
>
> More than one period for a single beneficiary may be opened by the
> same or different HHAs for different dates of service. This will occur
> particularly if a transfer to another HHA, or discharge and
> readmission to the same HHA, situation exists. Refer to
>
> §10.1.5.1 below for more information on multiple agencies furnishing
> home health services. Allowing multiple periods is intended to assure
> continuity of care and payment.

## - More Than One Agency Furnished Home Health Services

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> The primary HHA bills for all services furnished by both agencies and
> keeps all records pertaining to the care and other HHAs serving the
> same beneficiary. Nonprimary HHAs can receive payment under
> arrangement only from the primary HHA for services on the plan of care
> where prior arrangement exists. The primary agency's status as primary
> is
>
> established through the submission, receipt and processing of a Notice
> of Admission (NOA) for the home health care for the beneficiary. The
> secondary agency is paid through the primary agency under mutually
> agreed upon arrangements between the two agencies existing before the
> delivery of services for services called for under the plan of care.
>
> Two agencies must never bill as primary for the same beneficiary for
> the same admission period. When the Common Working File (CWF)
> indicates an admission period is open for a beneficiary, the A/B MAC
> (HHH) returns to the provider the NOA of any other agency billing
> unless the NOA indicates a transfer or discharge and readmission
> situation exists.
>
> In rare cases, a Medicare beneficiary may receive an organ transplant
> and the organ donor's post-operative services are covered by the
> Medicare program. Since the donor is frequently not a Medicare
> beneficiary, services for the donor are billed using the Medicare
> beneficiary's Medicare number. If both the organ recipient and organ
> donor are receiving post-operative home health services, CWF cannot
> process HH PPS periods for both patients for the same dates of
> service. In this case, the HH claim for the organ recipient is
> accepted by CWF. The HH claim for the donor is processed by the A/B
> MAC (HHH) outside CWF.

## - Effect of Election of Medicare Advantage (MA) Organization and Eligibility Changes on HH PPS

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> fee-for-service coverage, a new OASIS assessment must be completed, as
> is required any time the Medicare payment source changes. With that
> assessment, an NOA may be sent to Medicare to open an HH PPS period.
>
> If a beneficiary under fee-for-service receiving home care elects an
> MA organization during an HH PPS period of care, the period will end
> and be proportionally paid according to its shortened length (a
> partial period payment adjustment). The MA organization becomes the
> primary payer upon the MA organization enrollment date.

## - Basis of Medicare Prospective Payment Systems and Case-Mix

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> There are multiple prospective payment systems (PPS) for Medicare for
> different provider types. Before 1997, prospective payment was a term
> specifically applied to inpatient hospital services. In 1997, with
> passage of the Balanced Budget Act, prospective payment systems were
> mandated for other provider groups/bill types:

-   Skilled nursing facilities;

-   Outpatient hospital services;

-   Home health agencies;

-   Rehabilitation hospitals; and

-   Others.

> While there are commonalities among these systems, there are also
> variations in how each system operates and in the payment units for
> these systems.
>
> Case-mix is an underlying concept in prospective payment. With the
> creation of inpatient hospital PPS, the first Medicare PPS, there was
> a recognition that the differing characteristics of hospitals, such as
> teaching status or number of beds, contributed to substantial cost
> differences, but that even more cost impact was linked to the
> characteristics of the patient populations of the hospitals. Other
> Medicare PPS systems, where research is applied to adjust payments for
> patients requiring more complex or costly care, use this concept of
> case-mix complexity, meaning that patient characteristics affect the
> complexity, and therefore, cost of care. HH PPS considers a patient's
> clinical and functional condition in determining case-mix for home
> health care.
>
> For individual Medicare inpatient acute care hospital bills, diagnosis
> related groups (DRGs) are produced by claim information, which
> includes data elements such as procedure and diagnoses, through
> Grouper software that reads these pertinent elements on the claim and
> groups services into appropriate DRGs. DRGs are then priced by a
> separate Pricer software module at the A/B MAC (A). Processing for HH
> PPS is built on this model, using home health resources groups
> (HHRGs), instead of DRGs. In HH PPS, payments are case-mix adjusted
> using claim information and elements of the patient assessment.
>
> Since 1999, HHAs have been required by Medicare to assess potential
> patients, and reassess existing patients, incorporating the OASIS
> (Outcome and Assessment Information Set) tool as part of the
> assessment process. The total case-mix adjusted payment is based on
> elements of the OASIS data set and other information provided on the
> claim. Payments made for the period are case-mix adjusted based on
> Grouper run in Medicare systems. Pricer software run by the A/B MAC
> (HHH) processing home health claims performs pricing including wage
> index adjustment and other factors.

## - Composition of HIPPS Codes for HH PPS

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> For HH PPS periods of care, the distinct 5-position, alphanumeric home
> health HIPPS codes are created as follows:

-   The first position represents a combination of the referral source
    > (community or institutional) and the period timing (early or
    > late).

-   The second and third positions represent the clinical and functional
    > domains of the HHRG coding system.

-   The fourth position represents the co-morbidity category that
    > applies to the patient.

-   The fifth position is a placeholder for future use, required only
    > because the field used to report HIPPS codes requires five
    > positions.

### (Rev. 10987, Issued: 09-10-2021, Effective: 01-01-2022, Implementation: 11-10-2021)

> HHAs shall no longer submit Requests for Anticipated Payment (RAPS
> -TOB 0322) for any HH period of care with a From date on or after
> January 1, 2022. Instead, for each admission to home health, the HHA
> notifies Medicare systems via submission of an NOA.
>
> HHAs shall send the NOA to the A/B MAC (HHH) by mail, electronic data
> interchange (EDI), or direct data entry (DDE). EDI submissions require
> additional data not required by the NOA itself, to satisfy transaction
> standards. This data is described in a companion guide available on
> the CMS website. HHAs may voluntarily agree to adopt the companion
> guide and use it to submit EDI NOAs at any time.
>
> For all beneficiaries receiving HH services in 2021 whose services
> will continue in 2022, the HHA shall submit an NOA with a one-time,
> artificial \'admission\' date corresponding to the \"From\" date of
> the first period of continuing care in 2022. For example, if a period
> of care begins in 2021 and ends on January 10, 2022, the HHA submits
> and NOA with an admission date of January 11, 2022 and then submits a
> claim when the 30-day period of care is over. The HHA should submit
> the January 11, 2022 admission date on all subsequent claims until the
> beneficiary is discharged and another NOA is required. This is to
> ensure the claim is matched to the correct NOA and the correct receipt
> date is used for payment.
>
> The HHA can submit an NOA to Medicare when:

-   The HHA has obtained a verbal or written order from the physician
    > that contains the services required for the initial visit, and

-   The HHA has conducted an initial visit at the start of care.

> Only one NOA is required for any series of HH periods of care
> beginning with admission to home care and ending with discharge. After
> a discharge has been reported to Medicare, a new NOA is required
> before the HHA submits any additional claims.
>
> NOAs must be submitted timely. A timely-filed NOA is submitted to and
> accepted by the A/B MAC (HHH) within five calendar days after
> admission date.
>
> In instances where an NOA is not timely-filed, Medicare shall reduce
> the payment for a period of care, including outlier payment, by the
> number of days from the home health admission date to the date the NOA
> is submitted to, and accepted by, the A/B MAC (HHH), divided by 30. No
> LUPA per-visit payments shall be made for visits that occurred on days
> that fall within the period of care prior to the submission of the
> NOA. This reduction shall be a provider liability, and the provider
> shall not bill the beneficiary for it.
>
> If an HHA fails to file a timely-filed NOA, it may request an
> exception, which, if approved, waives the consequences of late filing.
> The four circumstances that may qualify the HHA for an exception are
> as follows:

1.  fires, floods, earthquakes, or other unusual events that inflict
    extensive damage to the HHA's ability to operate;

2.  an event that produces a data filing problem due to a CMS or A/B MAC
    (HHH) systems issue that is beyond the control of the HHA;

3.  a newly Medicare-certified HHA that is notified of that
    certification after the Medicare certification date, or which is
    awaiting its user ID from its A/B MAC (HHH); or,

4.  other circumstances determined by the A/B MAC (HHH) or CMS to be
    beyond the control of the HHA.

> When an NOA is submitted within the five day timely filing period, but
> the NOA contains inadvertent errors (such as a beneficiary identifier
> that has recently changed), the error may not trigger the NOA to be
> immediately returned to the HHA for correction. In these instances,
> the HHA must wait until the incorrect information is fully processed
> by Medicare systems before the NOA is returned for correction. Such
> delays in Medicare systems could cause the NOA to be late. Delays due
> to Medicare system constraints are outside the control of the HHA and
> may qualify for an exception to the timely filing requirement.
>
> An admission period will be opened on CWF with the receipt and
> processing of the NOA. NOAs are submitted using TOB 032A. After this
> admission period is recorded, the HHA can submit claims for HH periods
> of care in the admission.
>
> See section 40.1 for detailed submission instructions and required
> information for the NOA.

>
> HHAs may not submit this claim until after all services are provided
> for the period and the physician has signed the plan of care and any
> subsequent verbal order.
>
> All HH PPS claims must be submitted with TOB 0329. The HH PPS claim

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> By law under the HH PPS system, beneficiaries must be able to transfer
> among HHAs, and payments must be pro-rated to reflect these changes.
> To accommodate this requirement, HHAs submit an NOA with condition
> code 47 to indicate a transfer when an admission period may already be
> open for the same beneficiary at another HHA.
>
> In order for a receiving HHA to accept a beneficiary elected transfer,
> the receiving HHA must document that the beneficiary has been informed
> that the initial HHA will no longer receive Medicare payment on behalf
> of the patient and will no longer provide Medicare
>
> covered services to the patient after the date of the patient's
> elected transfer in accordance with current patient rights
> requirements at [42 CFR
> 484.10(e).](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) Documentation of
> these notifications may be needed if the transfer is disputed and
> verification is required as described in the Medicare Benefit Policy
> Manual, chapter 7, section 10.8.E. The receiving HHA must also
> document in its records that it accessed a Medicare inquiry system to
> determine whether or not the patient was under an established home
> health plan of care and contacted the initial HHA on the effective
> date of transfer.
>
> In such cases, the previously open admission period will be
> automatically closed in Medicare claims processing systems as of the
> date services began at the HHA the beneficiary transferred to, as
> reported in the NOA. The new admission period for the "transfer to"
> agency will begin on that same date. Payment will be pro-rated for the

## - Discharge and Readmission Situation Under HH PPS -

> **Payment Effects**

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> Under HH PPS, HHAs may discharge beneficiaries before the period of
> care has closed if all treatment goals of the plan of care have been
> met. Cases may occur in which an HHA has discharged a beneficiary
> during a period of care, but the beneficiary is readmitted to the same
> agency in the same 30 days. Since no portion of the period can be paid
> twice, the first payment must be pro-rated to reflect the shortened
> period (see
> [§10.1.15](#payment-adjustments---partial-period-payment-adjustment)).
> A new admission period can be opened by the HHA. Medicare systems will
> allow this in cases where the CMS certification number (CCN) on the
> new NOA matches the CCN on the prior period. The next period of care
> will begin the date the first service is supplied under readmission
> (setting a new 30-day "clock").
>
> Note that beneficiaries do not have to be discharged within the period
> because of admissions to other types of health care providers (i.e.,
> hospitals, skilled nursing facilities), but HHAs may choose to
> discharge in such cases. If an agency chooses not to discharge and the
> patient returns to the agency in the same 30-day period, the same
> period of care continues. However, if an agency chooses to discharge,
> based on an expectation that the beneficiary will not return, the
> agency should recognize that if the beneficiary does return to them in
> the same period, the discharge is not recognized for Medicare payment
> purposes. All the HH services provided in the complete period of care,
> both before and after the inpatient stay, should be billed on one
> claim. When discharging, full payment would still be made unless the
> beneficiary received more home care later in the same period.
>
> Discharge is not required if the beneficiary has an inpatient stay
> that spans the end of the first 30-day period of care in a 60-day
> certification period. The HHA should submit the claim for the period
> following the discharge as if the 30-day periods were contiguous --
> submit a From date of day 31, even though it falls during the
> inpatient stay and the first visit date that occurs after the hospital
> discharge. Medicare systems will allow the HH claim to overlap the
> inpatient claim for dates in which there are no HH visits.

## - Payment Adjustments - Partial Period Payment Adjustment

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> Both transfer situations and discharge and readmission to the same
> agency in a 30-day period result in shortened periods of care. In such
> cases, payment will be pro-rated.
>
> Partial period payment adjustments occur as a result of the two
> following situations:

a.  When a patient has been discharged and readmitted to home care
    within the same 30-day period of care; or

b.  When a patient transfers to another HHA during a 30-day period of
    > care.

> Both situations are indicated on the claim by reporting a Patient
> Discharge Status code of
>
> 06\. Based on the presence of this code, Pricer calculates a partial
> period payment adjustment to the claim. This is a proportional payment
> amount based on the number of days of service provided, which is the
> total number of days counted from and including the day of the first
> billable service to and including the day of the last billable
> service, divided by 30.
>
> The contractor shall use the following remittance advice messages and
> associated codes when paying partial period payment adjustments under
> this policy. This CARC/RARC combination is compliant with CAQH CORE

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> If a beneficiary dies during a period of care, full payment will be
> made for the period, including payment adjustments applicable to given
> services actually delivered prior to death. However, there is one
> exception. Partial period payment adjustments will not apply to the
> claim, because no more home care can be delivered in the 30-day

## - Payment Adjustments - Low Utilization Payment Adjustments (LUPAs)

### (Rev. 10919, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:01-01-22, Implementation: 01-03-22)

> If an HHA provides fewer than the threshold of visits specified for
> the period's HHRG, they will be paid a standardized per visit payment.
> Such payment adjustments are called Low Utilization Payment
> Adjustments (LUPAs).
>
> On LUPA claims, nonroutine supplies will not be reimbursed in addition
> to the visit payments, since total annual supply payments are factored
> into all payment rates. If the claim for the LUPA is later adjusted
> such that the number of visits is equal to or greater than the
> threshold for the HHRG, payments will be adjusted to an HHRG basis,
> rather than a visit basis.
>
> If the LUPA period is the first in a sequence of adjacent periods or
> is the only period of care the beneficiary received, Medicare will
> make an additional add-on payment.
>
> Medicare will add to these claims an amount calculated from a factor
> established in regulation. This additional payment will be reflected
> in the payment for the earliest dated revenue code line representing a
> home health visit for skilled nursing, physical therapy, occupational
> therapy (after January 1, 2022), or speech-language pathology.
>
> One criterion that Medicare uses to determine whether a LUPA add-on
> payment applies is that the claim Admission Date matches the claim
> "From" Date. HHAs should take care to ensure that they submit accurate
> admission dates, especially if claims are submitted out of sequence.
> Inaccurate admission dates may result in Medicare systems returning
> LUPA claims where an add-on payment applies, but the add-on was paid
> inappropriately on a later dated period in the same sequence.
>
> Additionally, Medicare systems may return to the provider LUPA claims
> if the claim meets the criteria for a LUPA add-on payment but it
> contains no qualifying skilled service. In these cases, the HHA may
> add the skilled visit to the claim if it was omitted in error and
> re-submit the claim. Otherwise, the HHA may only re-submit the claim
> using condition code 21, indicating a billing for a denial notice.

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> Submission of an OASIS assessment is a condition of payment for HH

>
> During claims processing, the quality system, known as the Internet
> Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (iQIES), provides the claims

> If a claim is submitted and Medicare systems do not find the matching

>
> HHAs should take the following steps:

1.  Double-check the FVR to confirm the receipt date shows the OASIS was
    accepted by iQIES before you submitted your claim. This date is
    shown on Page 1 of the report, in the field labeled, "Completion
    Date/Time." Also, ensure that the assessment has not been
    inactivated.

    -   If the OASIS was submitted after the claim, resubmit the claim

    -   If the assessment was inactivated, resubmit the assessment.

2.  Ensure the assessment is one that is used for determining payments.
    The Reason for Assessment (RFA) (OASIS Item M0100) must be equal to
    01, 03, 04, or 05.

    -   If the claim matches an assessment that is for another reason,
        > update the occurrence code 50 date on the claim to correspond
        > to the M0090 date of the applicable assessment and resubmit
        > the claim.

3.  Ensure you have submitted occurrence code 50 on any claims,
    reporting the assessment completion date (item M0090) as the
    associated date

    -   If the occurrence code is missing, update the claim and resubmit
        > it.

4.  Check the items Medicare systems use to match the claim and OASIS,
    making sure that they are the same on both submissions. These are:

    -   Your CMS Certification Number (OASIS item M0010)

    -   Beneficiary Medicare Number (OASIS item M0063)

    -   Assessment Completion Date (OASIS item M0090)

> If any of these items do not match, correct the claim or the
> assessment, then resubmit.
>
> **Note**: Changes to a beneficiary's Medicare Beneficiary Identifier
> (MBI) can affect the match. If an HHA becomes aware of a change to the
> MBI via the MBI look-up tool and uses the new MBI on their claim when
> the prior MBI was used on the OASIS, that will cause the claim to be
> returned. In these cases, HHAs should update item M0063 on the OASIS
> and then resubmit the claim.
>
> If a claim with correct and matching information continues to RTP, the
> HHA should reach out to their MAC and provide:

-   The claim document control number (DCN)

-   The validation report's Page 1, showing the Completion Date/Time the
    batch of OASIS assessments was received

-   The validation report's page for the OASIS assessment in question,
    showing the RFA, Medicare Number, and M0090 date

-   Any other information requested by the MAC to confirm the matching
    OASIS The MAC shall use this information to research the issue.

> [When a Matching OASIS is Found]{.underline}
>
> When the OASIS assessment if found, answers to the OASIS items used in
> PDGM case- mix scoring are returned to the claims system and stored on
> the claim record. This information is displayed on a screen in the
> claims system, so the HHA can refer to it.
>
> Medicare systems combine OASIS items and claims data (period timing,
> inpatient discharge, diagnoses) and send them to HH Grouper program
> (see section 80). The Grouper-produced HIPPS code replaces the

> revised OASIS information will be sent to the HH Grouper and a new
> HIPPS will be used for payment. This HIPPS code will be recorded in
> the APC-HIPPS field. This code will match the code on the electronic

-   Occurrence span code 77 with span dates matching the From/Through
    dates of the claim, indicating the HHA's acknowledgment of liability
    for the billing period, and

-   Condition code D2, indicating that billing for the Health Insurance
    Prospective Payment System (HIPPS) code is changed to non-covered.

> Condition code 21 must not be used in these instances, since it would

## - Payment Adjustments - Outlier Payments

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> HH PPS payment groups are based on averages of home care experience.
> When cases "lie outside" expected experience by involving an unusually
> high level of services in 30- day periods of care, Medicare claims
> processing systems will provide outlier payments in addition to the
> case-mix adjusted payment. Outlier payments can result from medically
> necessary high utilization in any or all of the service disciplines.
>
> Outlier determinations are made by comparing:

-   The estimated cost for a period of care, calculated as the sum of
    the products of number of units of each discipline on the claim and
    each wage-adjusted national standardized per unit rate for each
    discipline (1 unit = 15 minutes); with

-   The sum of the period payment and a wage-adjusted standard fixed
    loss threshold amount.

> If the estimated cost is greater than the wage adjusted and case-mix
> specific payment amount plus the wage adjusted fixed loss threshold
> amount, a set percentage (the loss sharing ratio) of the amount by
> which the estimated cost exceeds the sum will be paid to the HHA as an
> outlier payment. Units considered for outlier payment are subject to a
> limit of 32 units (8 hours), summed across the six disciplines of
> care, per date of service.
>
> For rare instances when more than one discipline of care is provided
> and there is more than 8 hours of care provided in 1 day, the cost
> associated with the care provided during that day will be calculated
> using a hierarchical method based on the cost per unit per discipline.
> The discipline of care with the lowest associated cost per unit will
> be discounted in the calculation of cost in order to cap the
> estimation of cost at 8 hours of care, summed across the six
> disciplines, per day.
>
> The outlier payment is a payment for an entire period, and therefore
> carried only at the claim level on the paid claim. It is not allocated
> to specific lines of the claim.
>
> HHAs do not submit anything on their claims to be eligible for outlier
> consideration. The outlier payment shall be included in the total
> payment for the claim on a remittance, but it will be identified
> separately on the claim using value code 17 with an associated dollar
> amount representing the outlier payment. Outlier payments will also
> appear on the electronic remittance advice in a separate segment.
>
> Outlier payments made to each HHA are subject to an annual limitation.
> Medicare systems ensure that outlier payments comprise no more than 10
> percent of the HHA's total HH PPS payments for the year. Medicare
> systems track both the total amount of HH PPS payments that each HHA
> has received and the total amount of outlier payments that each HHA
> has received. When each HH PPS claim is processed, Medicare systems
> compare these two amounts and determine whether the 10 percent has
> currently been met.
>
> If the limitation has not yet been met, any outlier amount is paid
> normally. If the limitation has been met or would be exceeded by the
> outlier amount calculated for the current claim, other HH PPS amounts
> for the claim are paid but any outlier amount is not paid. Partial
> outlier payments are not made.
>
> The contractor shall use the following remittance advice messages and
> associated codes when not paying outlier amounts under this policy.
> This CARC/RARC combination is compliant with CAQH CORE Business
> Scenario Three.
>
> Group Code: CO CARC: 119 RARC: N/A
>
> MSN: N/A
>
> Since the payment of subsequent claims may change whether an HHA has
> exceeded the limitation over the course of the timely filing period,
> Medicare systems conduct a quarterly reconciliation process. All
> claims where an outlier amount was calculated but not paid when the
> claim was initially processed shall be reprocessed to determine
> whether the outlier has become payable. If the outlier can be paid,
> the claim is adjusted to increase the payment by the outlier amount.
> Additionally, if any HHAs are found to have been overpaid outlier

## - Changes in a Beneficiary's Payment Source

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

1.  Payment Source Changes From Medicare Advantage (MA) Organization to
    Original Medicare.

> If a Medicare beneficiary is covered under an MA Organization during a
> period of home care, and subsequently decides to change to Original
> Medicare coverage, a new start of care OASIS assessment must be
> completed that reflects the date of the beneficiary's change to this
> pay source. This is required any time the payment source changes to
> Original Medicare. With that assessment, an NOA may be sent to
> Medicare to open an HH PPS admission period. HHAs are advised to
> verify the patient's payer source on a regular basis when providing
> services to a patient with an MA Organization payer source to avoid
> the circumstance of not having an OASIS to be used to determine the
> payment group, or having the patient discharged without an OASIS
> assessment.
>
> If a follow-up assessment is used to generate a new start of care
> assessment, CMS highly recommends, but does not require, a discharge
> OASIS assessment be done.
>
> While this is not a requirement, conducting a "paper" discharge at the
> point where the patient's change in insurance coverage occurred will
> provide a clear endpoint to the patient's episode of care for purposes
> of the individual HHA's outcome-based quality reports. Otherwise, that
> patient will not be included in the HHA's quality measure statistics.
> It will also keep that patient from appearing on the HHA's roster
> report (a report the HHAs can access from the OASIS system that is
> helpful for tracking OASIS
>
> start of care and follow-up transmissions) when the patient is no
> longer subject to OASIS data collection.
>
> In cases where the patient changes from MA coverage to Original
> Medicare coverage, the patient's overall Medicare coverage is
> uninterrupted. This means an HH PPS period of care may be billed
> beginning on the date of the patient's Original Medicare coverage.
>
> Upon learning of the change in MA election, the HHA should submit an
> NOA using the date of the first visit provided after the Original
> Medicare effective date as the "from" date. The OASIS assessment
> performed most recently after the change in election is used to
> produce a HIPPS code for the first claim in the new admission period.
>
> If a new start of care (SOC) OASIS assessment was not conducted at the
> time of the change in pay source, a correction to an existing OASIS
> assessment may be necessary to change the reported payer source. The
> HHA should correct the existing OASIS assessment conducted most
> closely after the new start date. If more than one 30-day period has
> elapsed before the HHA learns of the change in payer source, this
> procedure can be applied to the additional periods. If the patient is
> still receiving services, the HHA must complete the routine follow-up
> OASIS assessments (RFA4) consistent with the new start of care date.
> In some cases, HHAs may need to inactivate previously transmitted
> assessments to reconcile the data collections with the new dates.

2.  Payment Source Changes From Original Medicare to MA Organization

> In cases where the patient elects MA coverage during an HH PPS period
> of care, the period will end and be proportionally paid according its
> shortened length (a partial period payment adjustment). The MA
> Organization becomes the primary payer upon the MA enrollment date.
> The HHA may learn of the change after the fact, for instance, upon
> rejection of their claim by Medicare claims processing systems. The
> HHA must resubmit this claim indicating a transfer of payer source
> using patient status code "06," and reporting only the visits provided
> under the fee-for-service eligibility period. The claim through date
> and the last billable service must occur before the MA enrollment
> date. If the patient has elected to move from Original Medicare to an
> MA Organization and is still receiving skilled services, the HHA
> should indicate the change in payer source on the OASIS at the next
> assessment time point.

3.  Payment Source Changes Involving Medicaid

> There may be cases where a patient eligible for both Medicare and
> Medicaid is receiving home health services covered under Medicaid and
> the patient experiences a change in status that allows their home
> health services to meet coverage criteria for Original Medicare. In
> these cases, a new start of care OASIS assessment must be completed
> that reflects the date of the beneficiary's change to this pay source.
> This is required any time the payment source changes to Original
> Medicare. With that assessment, an NOA may be sent to Medicare to open
> an HH PPS admission period. The OASIS guidance provided above for
> changes from Medicare Advantage to Original Medicare apply in this
> case also.
>
> If a patient eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid is receiving home
> health services covered under Medicare and ceases to meet Medicare
> coverage criteria, the patient should be discharged for Medicare
> purposes. Patient status code "06" should not be used. This discharge
> has no payment impact on the Medicare HH PPS period. If the patient
> being discharged to Medicaid-only coverage is still receiving skilled
> services, the HHA should indicate the change in payer source on the
> OASIS at the next assessment.

## - Home Health Prospective Payment System (HH PPS) Consolidated Billing

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> Section 1842 (b)(6)(F) of the Social Security Act requires
> consolidated billing of all home health services while a beneficiary
> is under a home health plan of care authorized by a physician.
> Consequently, Medicare makes payment for all such items and services
> to a single HHA overseeing that plan. This HHA is known as the primary
> HHA for HH PPS billing purposes.
>
> The law states payment will be made to the primary HHA without regard
> as to whether or not the item or service was furnished by the agency,
> by others under arrangement to the primary agency, or when any other
> contracting or consulting arrangements exist with the primary agency,
> or "otherwise." Payment for all items is included in the HH PPS
> payment the primary HHA receives.
>
> Types of services that are subject to the home health consolidated
> billing provision:

-   Skilled nursing care;

-   Home health aide services;

-   Physical therapy;

-   Speech-language pathology;

-   Occupational therapy;

-   Medical social services;

-   Routine and nonroutine medical supplies;

-   Medical services provided by an intern or resident-in-training of a
    hospital, under an approved teaching program of the hospital, in the
    case of an HHA that is affiliated or under common control with that
    hospital; and

-   Care for homebound patients involving equipment too cumbersome to
    > take to the home.

> Exception: Therapy services are not subject to the home health
> consolidated billing methodology when performed by a physician.
>
> Medicare periodically publishes Recurring Update Notifications that
> contain updated lists of nonroutine supply codes and therapy codes
> that must be included in home health consolidated billing. Medicare
> updates the lists annually, effective January 1, as a result of annual
> changes in HCPCS codes, unless the HCPCS changes do not affect home
> health services. The lists may also be updated as frequently as
> quarterly if this is required by the creation of new HCPCS codes
> mid-year.
>
> The HHA that submits an NOA successfully processed by Medicare claims
> processing systems will be recorded as the primary HHA for a given
> period in the CWF. If a beneficiary transfers during a 30-day period
> of care, then the transfer HHA that establishes the new plan of care
> assumes responsibility for consolidating billing for the beneficiary.
> A/B MACs (HHH) will reject any claims from providers or suppliers
> other than the primary HHA that contain billing for the services and
> items subject to consolidated billing when billed for dates of service
> within a period of care (see §20.2 for details).
>
> A/B MACs (HHH) will also reject claims subject to consolidated billing
> when submitted by the primary HHA as services not under an HH plan of
> care (using TOB 034x) when the primary HHA has already billed other
> services under an HH plan of care (TOB 032x) for the beneficiary.
> Institutional providers may access information on existing periods of
> care through the home health CWF inquiry process. See
> [§30.1](#eligibility-query-to-determine-status).
>
> Durable medical equipment is exempt from home health consolidated
> billing by law. Therefore, DME may be billed by a supplier or an HHA
> (including HHAs other than the primary HHA). Medicare claims
> processing systems will allow either party to submit DME claims, but
> will ensure that the same DME items are not submitted by multiple
> providers for the same dates of service for the same beneficiary. In
> the event of duplicate billing, the first claim received will be
> processed and paid. Subsequent duplicate claims will be denied.
> Medicare claims processing systems will also prevent payment for the
>
> purchase and the rental of the same item for the same dates of
> service. In this event, the first claim received, regardless of
> whether for purchase or rental, will be processed and paid.
>
> The exception to the above, however, is competitive bidding for
> certain DME. HHAs that furnish DME and are located in an area where
> DME items are subject to a competitive bidding program, must either be
> awarded a contract to furnish the items in this area or use a contract
> supplier in the community to furnish these items. The competitive
> bidding items are identified by HCPCS codes and the competitive
> bidding areas are identified based on ZIP Codes where beneficiaries
> receiving these items maintain their permanent residence. Home health
> agency claims submitted for HCPCS codes subject to a competitive
> bidding program will be returned to the provider to remove the
> affected DME line items and the providers will be advised to submit
> those charges to the DME MACs, who will have jurisdiction over all
> claims for competitively bid items.
>
> Osteoporosis drugs are subject to home health consolidated billing,
> even though these drugs continue to be paid on a cost basis in
> addition to the HH unit of payment. For more detailed information,
> refer to §20.2.3 and §90.1.

## - Beneficiary Notification and Payment Liability Under Home Health Consolidated Billing

> **(Rev. 635, Issued: 08-05-05; Effective: 10-01-00; Implementation:
> 11-03-05)**

## - Responsibilities of Home Health Agencies

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> Medicare payment for services subject to home health consolidated
> billing is made to the primary HHA, so separate Medicare payment for
> these services will never be made. The primary HHA is responsible for
> providing these services, either directly or under arrangement. This
> responsibility applies to all services that the physician has ordered
> on the beneficiary's home health plan of care.
>
> However, providing services either directly or under arrangement
> requires knowledge of the services provided during the period of care.
> An HHA would not be responsible for payment to another provider in the
> situation in which they have no prior knowledge (e.g., they are
> unaware of physicians orders) of the services provided by that
> provider to a patient who is under their home health plan of care.
>
> In certain circumstances where the primary HHA is unaware of services
> provided during the period of care and the beneficiary is properly
> notified, the beneficiary may be liable for payment for these
> services. In order to protect the beneficiary from unexpected
> liability in these cases, and in order to comply with Medicare
> Conditions of Participation, it is important that all providers and
> suppliers serving a home health patient notify the beneficiary of the
> possibility that they will be responsible for payment.
>
> Notification about home health consolidated billing must begin with
> the beneficiary's admission to home health care. Under the Medicare
> Home Health Services Conditions of Participation: Patient rights, (42
> CFR, §484.10 (c) (i)), the HHA must advise the patient, in advance, of
> the disciplines (e.g., skilled nursing, physical therapy, home health
> aide, etc.) that will furnish care, and the frequency of visits
> proposed to be furnished. It is, therefore, the responsibility of the
> HHA to fully inform beneficiaries that all home health services,
> including therapies and supplies, will be provided by his/her primary
> HHA.
>
> In addition, under the Conditions of Participation: Patient liability
> for payment, (42 CFR,
>
> §484.10(e)), HHAs are responsible for advising the patient, in
> advance, about the extent to which payment is expected from Medicare
> or other sources, including the patient.
>
> Information regarding patient liability for payment must be provided
> by the HHA both orally and in writing. This should assist in alerting
> the beneficiary to the possibility of payment liability if he/she were
> to obtain services from anyone other than their primary HHA.
>
> HHAs are also responsible for the timely submission of a Notice of
> Admission (NOA). This ensures information about their primary HHA
> status is available to other providers.

## - Responsibilities of Providers/Suppliers of Services Subject to Consolidated Billing

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> Since Medicare payment for services subject to home health
> consolidated billing is made to the primary HHA, providers or
> suppliers of these services must be aware that separate Medicare
> payment will not be made to them. Therefore, before they provide
> services to a Medicare beneficiary, these providers or suppliers need
> to determine whether or not a home health period of care exists for
> that beneficiary. This information may be available to providers or
> suppliers from a number of sources.
>
> The first avenue a therapy provider or a supplier may pursue is to ask
> the beneficiary (or his/her authorized representative) if he/she is
> presently receiving home health services under a home health plan of
> care. Beneficiaries and their representatives should have the most
> complete information as to whether or not they are receiving home
> health care.
>
> Therapy providers or suppliers may, but are not required to, document
> information from the beneficiary that states the beneficiary is not
> receiving home health care, but such documentation in itself does not
> shift liability to either the beneficiary or Medicare.
>
> Additionally, information about current home health periods of care
> may be available from MACs. Institutional providers may access this
> information electronically through the home health CWF inquiry process
> (See [§30.1](#eligibility-query-to-determine-status)). Independent
> therapists or suppliers who bill using the professional claim format
> also have access to a similar electronic inquiry via the HIPAA
> Eligibility Transaction System (HETS). They may also, as a last
> resort, call their A/B MAC (B)'s provider toll free line to request
> home health eligibility
>
> information available on the Common Working File. The A/B MAC (B)'s
> information is based only on claims Medicare has received from home
> health agencies at the day of the contact.
>
> Medicare systems maintain a data file that captures and displays the
> dates when Medicare paid physicians for the certification or
> recertification of the beneficiary's HH plan of care. Physicians
> submit claims for these services to A/B MACs (B) on the professional
> claim format separate from the HHA's billing their claim on the
> institutional claim format for the HH services themselves.
>
> There may be instances in which the physician claim for the
> certification service is received before any HHA billing and this
> claim is the earliest indication Medicare systems have that HH
> services will be provided. As an aid to suppliers and providers
> subject to HH consolidated billing, Medicare systems display, for each
> Medicare beneficiary, the code for certification (G0180) or
> recertification (G0179) and the date of service for either of the two
> codes.
>
> Suppliers and providers should note that this information is
> supplementary to the previously existing sources of information about
> HH periods of care. Like HH period of care information maintained on

>
> If a therapy provider or a supplier learns of a home health period of

> liable for payment for the services. Beneficiaries should be notified
> of their potential liability before the services are provided.
>
> If a therapy provider or a supplier learns of a home health period of

## - Responsibilities of Hospitals Discharging Medicare Beneficiaries to Home Health Care

### (Rev. 635, Issued: 08-05-05; Effective: 10-01-00; Implementation: 11-03-05)

> A hospital discharging a Medicare beneficiary to home health care can
> also play an important role in alerting the beneficiary to their
> potential liability under home health consolidated billing. Under the
> Medicare Conditions of Participation (COP) for Hospitals: Discharge
> planning, (42 CFR, §482.43 (b) (3) and (6)), hospitals must have in
> effect a discharge planning process that applies to all patients, and
> the discharge planning evaluation must include an evaluation of the
> likelihood of a patient needing post-hospital services and of the
> availability of the services. The hospital must include the discharge
> planning evaluation in the patient's medical record for use in
> establishing an appropriate discharge plan and the hospital must
> discuss the results of the evaluation with the patient or individual
> acting on his or her behalf. In addition, under 42 CFR, §482.43 (c)
> (5), the patient and family members must be counseled to prepare them
> for post-hospital care and under 42 CFR, §482.43 (d) Transfer or
> referral, the hospital must transfer or refer patients, along with
> necessary medical information, to appropriate facilities, agencies, or
> outpatient services, as needed, for followup or ancillary care.
>
> Hospitals, therefore, should counsel beneficiaries being discharged to
> receive home health services, that his/her "primary" home health
> agency; i.e., the agency establishing his/her plan of care, will
> provide all home health services. Hospitals should provide a list of
> home health agencies for beneficiaries to choose from; in addition,
> when referring the beneficiary to his/her chosen home health agency,
> the hospital should notify the agency and include any counseling
> notes, which should serve as a reminder to the home health agency to
> also notify the beneficiary that all home health services will be
> provided by them as the "primary" home health agency. Hospitals play a
> key role in making beneficiaries, and/or their caregivers, aware of
> Medicare home health coverage policies to help ensure that those
> services are provided appropriately.

## - Home health Consolidated Billing Edits in Medicare Systems

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> In short, consolidated billing requires that only the primary HHA bill
> services under the home health benefit, with the exception of DME and
> therapy services provided by physicians, for the period of that period
> of care. The types of service most affected are nonroutine supplies
> and outpatient therapies, since these services are routinely billed by
> providers other than HHAs, or are delivered by HHAs outside of plans
> of care.
>
> Home health consolidated billing edits are applied when the period of
> care claim has been received and processed in CWF. Edits are applied
> differently depending on whether the HH patient was
> discharged/transferred at the end of the HH period or not.
>
> If the patient was discharged or transferred, the edits apply to dates
> of service between the period start date and the last billable service
> date for the period. The start date and last service date are
> excluded.
>
> If the patient is not discharged or transferred (patient status 30,
> "Still Patient"), the edits apply to dates of service between the
> period start date and the period end date. The start date is excluded
> but the end date is included.
>
> If any line item services subject to consolidated billing are
> identified within these dates, CWF sends information to the
> contractors that enables them to reject or deny those line items.
>
> Claims subject to consolidated billing may be identified in one of two
> ways. Claims may be edited when the HH PPS claim had been received
> before the claim for services subject to consolidated billing. In
> these cases, the line items subject to consolidated billing are
> rejected or denied prior to payment. Claims may also be identified
> when the HH PPS claim is received after the other claims subject to
> consolidated billing. In these cases, the claim for services subject
> to consolidated billing has already been paid. CWF then notifies the
> contractor to make a post-payment rejection or denial.
>
> For post-payment rejections of claims billed on institutional claims,
> recoveries will be made automatically in the claims process. For
> post-payment rejections of claims billed on professional claims, those
> contractors will follow their routine overpayment identification and
> recovery procedures. In the event a denial is reversed upon appeal, an
> override procedure exists to permit payment to be made.
>
> The contractor shall use the following remittance advice messages and
> associated codes when not paying outlier amounts under this policy.
> This CARC/RARC combination is compliant with CAQH CORE Business
> Scenario Four.
>
> Group Code: CO CARC: 97 RARC: N390 MSN: N/A
>
> Since home health consolidated billing is not an ABN situation, coding
> on incoming claims cannot allow Medicare systems to fully identify the
> payment liability for any denial. As described in §20.1, whether the
> denial is the liability of the primary HHA or the beneficiary is
> determined by whether the services are provided under arrangement and
> whether the beneficiary received notice of their potential liability.
> These denials are shown as provider liability on remittance advices
> (group code CO) to ensure therapy providers or suppliers explore
> whether a payment arrangement exists or can be made for the services.
> Despite this coding limitation, Medicare recognizes that ultimately
> beneficiaries may be liable for these services.

## - Nonroutine Supply Editing

### (Rev. 2977, Issued; 06-20-14, Effective: 09-23-14; ICD-10: Upon Implementation of ICD-10, Implementation: 09-23-14; ICD-10: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> For home health consolidated billing, nonroutine medical supplies are
> identified as a list of discrete items by HCPCS code. Supplies are
> billed to DME MACs using the professional claim format, in which line
> items have both a 'from' and 'to' date. The line item 'from' date is
> used to enforce consolidated billing of nonroutine medical supplies.
>
> Claims submitted by providers using the institutional claim format may
> include a nonroutine supply HCPCS code in addition to the other
> services provided. These supplies are either bundled into the rate
> paid for the primary service or are otherwise incident to the primary
> service(s) being rendered, therefore these supplies do not fall within
> the bundling provisions of HH PPS. As a result, supplies reported on
> institutional claims are not subject to consolidated billing edits by
> CWF.

## - Therapy Editing

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> On claims submitted by providers using the institutional claim format,
> CWF enforces consolidated billing for outpatient therapies by
> recognizing as therapies all services billed under revenue codes 042x,
> 043x, 044x. These revenue codes are subject to consolidated billing
> when submitted on types of bill 013x, 023x, 034x, 074x, 075x or 085x.
>
> Consolidated billing edits do not apply on TOB 034x when the HHA is
> billing for disposable negative pressure wound therapy services during
> an HH period of care.
>
> On claims submitted by practitioners using the professional claim
> format, CWF enforces consolidated billing for outpatient therapies
> using a list of HCPCS codes which represent therapy services.
>
> Therapy services on professional claims are not subject to the home
> health consolidated billing methodology when performed by a physician.
> Therefore, CWF bypasses the therapy edit if the HCPCS code is a
> therapy code subject to home health consolidated billing but the
> specialty code on the claim indicates a physician.
>
> The following specialty codes indicate a physician for purposes of
> this edit:

## - Other Editing Related to Home Health Consolidated Billing

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> CWF edits to prevent duplicate billing across two providers.
> Consequently, CWF must edit to ensure that all DME items billed by
> HHAs have a line-item date of service and HCPCS code, even though HH
> consolidated billing does not apply to DME by law.
>
> If revenue code 0636 and the HCPCS code for an osteoporosis drug is
> billed on a TOB 034x claim during an open HH period of care, CWF
> ensures that the provider of the 034x claim is the same as the primary
> provider of the open period of care, since by law consolidated billing
> must also be applied to the osteoporosis drug even though this item is
> paid outside of the unit of payment. HH consolidated billing will not
> affect billing of DME or services outside the home health benefit,
> even when these services are billed by HHAs.

## - Only Notice of Admission (NOA) Received and Services Fall Within Admission Period

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> If only an NOA has been received and the incoming claim with services
> subject to consolidated billing contains dates of service within the
> HH admission period, CWF returns an alert to the Medicare contractor
> to notify them that the claim may be subject to consolidated billing.
> The Medicare contractor processes the claim to payment, but passes on
> the alert to the provider on the remittance advice at the line level.
>
> The contractor shall use the following remittance advice messages and
> associated codes when making payment under this policy. The CARC below
> is not included in the CAQH CORE Business Scenarios.
>
> Group Code: CO CARC: N/A RARC: N88 MSN: N/A
>
> This indicates to providers that the services may be denied and claim
> payment may be recouped if later editing or another post-payment
> recovery process identifies the claim as subject to consolidated
> billing.

## - No NOA Received and Therapy Services Rendered in the Home

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> There may be situations in which a beneficiary is under a home health
> plan of care, but CWF does not yet have a record of either an NOA or a
> home health claim for the period of care. To help inform independent
> therapy providers billing professional claims to Medicare contractors
> that the services they rendered in the home setting may be subject to
> consolidated billing, providers will receive notification on the
> remittance advice when Medicare pays them for the service.
>
> Medicare systems processing professional claims will provide this
> notification when the place of service on the claim is "12 home," the
> HCPCS code is a therapy code subject to home health consolidated
> billing and CWF has not returned a message indicating the presence of
> an NOA.

## - Common Working File (CWF) Requirements for the Home Health Prospective Payment System (HH PPS)

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03) HH-468, A3-3640**

## - Eligibility Query to Determine Status

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> Under the HH PPS and home health consolidated billing one HHA is
> considered the "primary" home health agency in billing situations.
> This primary agency is the only agency that may bill Medicare for home
> care for a given homebound beneficiary at a specific time. When a
> homebound beneficiary seeks care from an HHA or from an institutional
> therapy provider subject to home health consolidated billing, the
> provider needs to determine if the beneficiary is already being served
> by an HHA - an agency that then would be considered primary.
>
> Providers may send an inquiry to determine the beneficiary's
> entitlement and eligibility status into the Common Working File or
> CWF, through their A/B MAC (A) or (HHH). They must send the ASC X12
> 270 Health Care Eligibility Inquiry transaction set and will receive
> the ASC X12 271 Health Care Eligibility Response transaction set in
> response, in order to comply with the requirements of the Health
> Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
>
> A/B MACs (A) or (HHH) processing institutional claims will create an
> ELGH record from the 270 to request this data from CWF and will
> receive the ELGA record from CWF in response. The A/B MAC (A) or (HHH)
> will create the 271 response or DDE screen from the ELGA transaction
> record.
>
> The response shows whether or not the beneficiary is currently in a
> home health admission period. If the beneficiary is not already under
> care at another HHA, he/she can be admitted to the inquiring HHA, and
> that agency will become primary. The beneficiary can also be admitted
> even if an admission period is already open at another HHA if the
> beneficiary has chosen to transfer.
>
> []{#_bookmark44 .anchor}See chapter 31 for a description of the data

## - CWF Response to Inquiry

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> CWF will return information on the two periods of care in the CWF
> episode file closest to the date the HHA or other provider entered in
> the "applicable date" field. If a date is not specified, information
> on the two most recent periods of care wi[]{#_bookmark45 .anchor}ll be
> returned. See Chapter 31 for complete data sets returned to specific
> provider types.

## - Timeliness and Limitations of CWF Responses

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> Inquirers receive a response within a very short time frame. However,
> these responses are not truly "real time." The CWF auxiliary file that
> retains admission period and period of care information is updated by,
> and is only as current as, each NOA or claim batch run in CWF. All
> processed NOAs and claims will update the file, even if claims are
> ultimately denied. The CWF removes periods from the file only when:

-   HHAs cancel their own NOA for a period of care that includes no
    > subsequent claims;

-   HHAs cancel their own claims for periods that were not initially
    > created by an NOA; or

-   When a A/B MAC (HHH) processing HH claims cancels an NOA or a claim
    > for specific reasons (i.e., fraud).

> In general, responses will be as current as the previous day.
> Therefore, even when a response indicates a beneficiary is not
> currently in an admission period, the possibility exists that an NOA
> or claim could be in process, and the inquiring agency would still not
> be the primary HHA for a beneficiary for whom a "clear" inquiry was
> received. In such cases, the inquiring agency will not learn that it
> is not the primary HHA immediately.
>
> Also possible but even more rare, NOAs or claims from two different
> HHAs for the same beneficiary for the same date may be in the same
> batch sent to CWF. In such cases, the claim process will result in one
> of the two transactions being processed first and thereby deciding
> which of the two agencies will be primary.

## - Provider/Supplier Inquiries to MACs Based on Eligibility Responses

### (Rev. 1348, Issued: 10-05-07, Effective: 01-01-08, Implementation: 11-05-07)

> Institutional providers and/or suppliers may want to follow-up on
> information they receive, usually to contact the primary agency on
> file to bill under arrangement. The provider or supplier may determine
> the HHA's A/B MAC (HHH) from the [CMS
> Web](http://cms.hhs.gov/contacts/incardir.asp)
> [site](http://cms.hhs.gov/contacts/incardir.asp) which has a list of
> A/B MACs (HHH) that process HH claims by State. The provider or
> supplier also may ask its own MAC through existing provider inquiry
> channels. That MAC will instruct the provider regarding which A/B MAC
> (HHH) that processes HH claims to contact to learn which HHA is
> involved.
>
> A/B MACs (HHH) that process HH claims may provide information on
> either the provider or A/B MAC (HHH) that these providers may request.
> Information released will be determined by each MAC, such as HHA name
> and address, but must be enough for the inquiring provider/supplier to
> contact either the primary HHA, if under that A/B MAC (HHH)'s
> jurisdiction, or another A/B MAC (HHH), if the provider number is
> attached to another A/B MAC (HHH). If an instance ever exists where a
> provider is an individual, such as a provider doing business using a
> Social Security Number as a tax
>
> identification number, information cannot be released, since it would
> violate the individual's right to privacy.

## - National Home Health Prospective Payment Episode History File

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> CWF maintains a national history file for each beneficiary in order to
> enforce consolidated billing and perform HH PPS processing. Even
> though under the PDGM, the HH unit of payment is a 30-day period of
> care, this file continues to be named 'the episode file' in CWF. Only
> MACs, not providers, may view this file.
>
> The episode file, populated as soon as an admission period is opened
> for a beneficiary with an NOA, contains:

-   The beneficiary identifier;

-   Period Start and End Dates - the start date is received on an NOA or
    claim, and the end date is initially calculated to be the 30th day
    after the start date, changed as necessary when the claim for the
    period is finalized;

-   The pertinent A/B MAC (HHH), CMS Certification Number and National
    > Provider Identifier;

-   The HRG Code - the HIPPS code used to determine payment for the
    > period of care;

-   Date of Earliest Billing Activity (DOEBA) and Date of Latest Billing
    Activity (DOLBA) --line item dates of service of the first and last
    HH visits reported on the claim for the period of care;

-   Patient Status Indicator - the patient discharge status code on an
    > HH PPS claim, indicating the status of the HH patient at the end
    > of the period of care.

-   Cancellation Indicator -- Indicates if the claim has been denied as
    fully non- covered by medical review. In these cases, the indicator
    is a value of "2." In all other cases, the value is "0."

-   NOA Indicator -- Indicates the period was initially created by an
    > NOA, not a claim. If the NOA is submitted as a transfer, with
    > condition code 47, this indicator is set to '2.' For any other
    > NOAs, this indicator is set to '1.' If a period is created by a
    > continuing claim, this indicator is blank.

> The episode file contains the 36 most recent periods of care for any
> beneficiary. Periods that precede the most recent 36 will be dropped
> off the file and will not be retrievable online.

## - Opening and Length of HH PPS Episodes/Periods of Care

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> Within CWF, the episode history auxiliary file is separate from the
> home health benefit period auxiliary file (labeled HHEH), which
> existed prior to HH PPS and is used to administer payment of HH
> services from the correct Medicare Trust Fund. All HH PPS claims
> update both these files. NOAs only update the episode history file.
>
> The initial 30-day period of care is created on this file based on the
> NOA. The start date of this period of care is also used to indicate
> the start date of an HH admission period. The HH admission period is a
> claims processing concept used to correctly enforce primary HHA
> assignment and HH consolidated billing.
>
> Medicare systems determine a claim to fall within an HH admission
> period if it is within an admission period start and end date OR if it
> is on or after the start date of a period that remains open. Medicare
> systems determine the span of an admission period from HHEH period
> information as follows:
>
> Admission Period Start Date: The HHEH Period Start Date when the NOA
> indicator is 1 or 2.
>
> Admission Period End Date:

-   The HHEH Period End Date when the patient status on latest HHEH
    > period in a series of contiguous periods indicates a discharge
    > (the code is other than 30), or

-   The HHEH Start Date of a subsequent HHEH period when the NOA
    indicator on the subsequent period is 1 or 2.

> If an NOA with a different provider number falls within an admission
> period and does not report a transfer using condition code 47, the NOA
> will be returned to the provider because the HHA is not the primary
> HHA for that beneficiary. If a claim subject to HH consolidated
> billing falls within an admission period, but does not fall within
> dates that reflect an HH claim has been paid, the claim will receive
> an alert as described in section 20.2.5.
>
> The initial 30-day period of care created by the NOA is updated by the
> claim for that period. All subsequent periods of care in the admission
> will be created by the subsequent claims.
>
> Multiple periods can be open for the same beneficiary at the same
> time. The same HHA may require multiple periods be opened for the same
> beneficiary because of an unexpected readmission after discharge.
> Multiple periods may also occur between different providers if a
> transfer situation exists. CWF will post NOAs received with
> appropriate transfer and readmit indicators to facilitate the creation
> of multiple periods.
>
> Same day transfers are permitted, such that a period of care for one
> agency can end on the same date as a period of care was opened by
> another agency for the same beneficiary.
>
> Both HHA's services for this date will be approved for payment,
> without regard for whether the same HH disciplines (e.g. skilled
> nursing, physical therapy, etc.) from both HHAs provided services.
>
> When periods of care are created from NOAs, CWF calculates a period
> end date that does not exceed the start date plus 29 days. CWF will
> assure no period exceeds the maximum length under any circumstance,
> and will auto-adjust the period end date to shorten the period if
> needed based on subsequent NOA or claim submissions (i.e., shortened
> by transfer).

### (Rev. 4312, Issued: 05-23-19, Effective: 01-01-20, Implementation: 08-16-19)

> Beneficiaries cannot be institutionalized and receive home health care
> simultaneously. Therefore claims for institutional inpatient services
> (inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility (SNF) and swing bed
> claims), have priority in Medicare claims editing over claims for home
> health services.
>
> If an HH PPS claim is received, and CWF finds dates of service on the
> HH claim that falls within the dates of an inpatient, SNF or swing bed
> claim (not including the dates of admission and discharge and the
> dates of any leave of absence), Medicare systems will reject the HH
> claim. The HHA may submit a new claim removing any dates of service
> within the inpatient stay that were billed in error.
>
> If the HH PPS claim is received first and the inpatient hospital, SNF
> or swing bed claim comes in later, but contains dates of service
> duplicating dates of service on the HH PPS claim, Medicare systems
> will adjust the previously paid HH PPS claim to non-cover the

## - Completion of Form CMS-1450 for Home Health Agency Billing

### (Rev. 3021, Issued: 08-08-14, Effective: 01-01-12, Implementation: 09-08-14)

> The Social Security Act at §1862 (a)(22) requires that all claims for
> Medicare payment must be submitted in an electronic form specified by
> the Secretary of Health and Human Services, unless an exception
> described at §1862 (h) applies. The electronic form required for
> billing home health services is the ASC X12 837 institutional claim
> transaction. Since the data structure of the 837 transaction is
> difficult to express in narrative form and to provide assistance to
> small providers excepted from the electronic claim requirement, the
> instructions below are given relative to the data element names on the
> Form CMS-1450 hardcopy form. Each data element name is shown in bold
> type.
>
> Information regarding the form locator numbers that correspond to
> these data element names is found in chapter 25.
>
> Because claim formats serve the needs of many payers, some data
> elements may not be needed by a particular payer. This section
> provides detailed information only for items required for Medicare
> home health claims. Items not listed need not be completed although
> home health agencies may complete them when billing multiple payers.
> In all []{#_bookmark55 .anchor}cases, the provider is responsible for
> filing a timely claim for payment. (See chapter 1.)

## - Notice of Admission (NOA)

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> HHAs must send the NOA to the A/B MAC (HHH) by mail, electronic data
> interchange (EDI), or direct data entry (DDE). EDI submissions require
> additional data
>
> not required by the NOA itself, to satisfy transaction standards. This
> data is described in a companion guide available on the CMS website.
> HHAs may voluntarily agree to adopt the companion guide and use it to
> submit EDI NOAs at any time.
>
> The following data elements are required to submit an NOA under HH
> PPS. Provider Name, Address, and Telephone Number

#### *(Rev. 11796; Issued:01-19-23; Effective: 04-01-23; Implementation: 04-03-23)*

> The following data elements are required to submit a claim under home
> health PPS. For billing of home health claims not under an HH plan of
> care (not under HH PPS), see §90. Home health services under a plan of
> care are paid based on a 30-day period of care.

> NOA has been received for the beneficiary will be returned to the
> provider.
>
> Billing Provider Name, Address, and Telephone Number
>
> Required -- The HHA's minimum entry is the agency's name, city, state,
> and ZIP Code. The post office box number or street name and number may
> be included. The state may be abbreviated using standard post office
> abbreviations. Five or nine-digit ZIP Codes are acceptable. A/B MACs

    > These adjustment claims must be accepted at any point within the
    > timely filing period after the payment of the original claim.

8.  \- Void/Cancel of a Prior Claim - HHAs use this code to indicate
    > this bill is an exact duplicate of an incorrect bill previously
    > submitted. A replacement claim must be submitted for the period of
    > care to be paid.

9.  \- Final Claim for an HH PPS Period -- This code indicates an HH
    > original bill to be processed following the submission of an HH
    > PPS Notice of Admission (TOB 032A)

> HHAs must submit HH PPS claims with the 4^th^ digit of "9." These
> claims may be adjusted with code "7" or cancelled with code "8." A/B
> MACs (HHH) do not accept late charge bills, submitted with code "5,"
> on HH PPS claims. To add services within the period of a paid HH
> claim, the HHA must submit an adjustment.
>
> Statement Covers Period
>
> Required - The beginning and ending dates of the period covered by
> this claim. For continuous care periods, the "through" date must be 29
> days after the "From" date for a 30-day period of care
>
> In cases where the beneficiary has been discharged or transferred
> within the period, HHAs will report the date of discharge in
> accordance with internal discharge procedures as the "through" date.
> If the beneficiary has died, the HHA reports the date of death in the
> "through date."
>
> The HHA may submit claims for payment immediately after the claim
> "through" date. It is not required to hold claims until the end of the
> period of care unless the beneficiary continues under care.
>
> Patient Name/Identifier
>
> Required - The HHA enters the patient's last name, first name, and
> middle initial. Patient Address
>
> Required - The HHA enters the patient's full mailing address,
> including street number and name, post office box number or RFD, City,
> State, and ZIP Code.
>
> Patient Birth Date
>
> Required - The HHA enters the month, day, and year of birth of
> patient. If the full correct date is not known, leave blank.
>
> Patient Sex
>
> Required - "M" for male or "F" for female must be present. This item
> is used in conjunction with diagnoses and surgical procedures to
> identify inconsistencies.
>
> Admission/Start of Care Date
>
> Required - The HHA enters a date of admission matching the From date
> on the first period of care in an admission. On subsequent periods of
> care, the HHA continues to submit the admission date reported on the
> first period of care.
>
> Point of Origin for Admission or Visit
>
> Required - The HHA enters the appropriate NUBC point of origin code.
> Patient Discharge Status
>
> Required - The HHA enters the code that most accurately describes the
> patient's status as of the "Through" date of the billing period. Any
> applicable NUBC approved code may be used.
>
> Patient status code 06 should be reported in all cases where the HHA
> is aware that the period of care will be paid a partial period payment
> adjustment. These are cases in which the agency is aware that the
> beneficiary has transferred to another HHA within the 30-day period,
> or the agency is aware that the beneficiary was discharged with the
> goals of the original plan of care met and has been readmitted within
> the period. Situations may occur in which the HHA is unaware at the
> time of billing the discharge that these circumstances exist. In these
> situations, Medicare claims processing systems will adjust the
> discharge claim automatically to reflect the partial period payment
> adjustment, changing the patient status code on the paid claims record
> to 06.
>
> In cases where the ownership of an HHA is changing and the CMS
> certification number (CCN) also changes, the service dates on the
> claims must fall within the effective dates of the terminating CCN. To
> ensure this, all periods of care with "from" dates before the
> termination date of the CCN that would extend beyond the termination
> date must be resolved by the provider submitting claims with "through"
> dates on or before the termination date. The provider must code the
> claim with patient status 06. Billing for the beneficiary is being
> "transferred" to the new agency ownership. In changes of ownership
> which do not affect the CCN, billing is unaffected.
>
> In cases where an HHA is aware in advance that a beneficiary will
> become enrolled in a Medicare Advantage (MA) Organization as of a
> certain date, the provider should submit a claim for the shortened
> period prior to the MA Organization enrollment date. The provider must
> code the claim with patient status 06. Payment responsibility for the
> beneficiary is being "transferred" from Medicare fee-for-service to MA
> Organization, since HH PPS applies only to Medicare fee-for-service.
>
> Condition Codes
>
> Conditional -- The HHA enters any NUBC approved code to describe
> conditions that apply to the claim.
>
> If the claim is for a patient transferred from another HHA, the HHA
> enters condition code 47.
>
> If the claim is for a period of care in which there are no skilled HH
> visits in the billing period, but a policy exception that allows
> billing for covered services is documented at the HHA, the HHA enters
> condition code 54.
>
> *As a result of disaster conditions (such as hurricane or wildfire)
> that render submission of OASIS assessments impossible, Medicare may
> issue a waiver indicating OASIS submission is waived. In this case,
> HHAs should report condition code DR on their claim to indicate
> billing under the waiver. Since the OASIS assessment cannot be
> submitted, the HHA cannot report occurrence code 50 to show the
> assessment completion date.*
>
> *Claims without occurrence code 50 will be accepted if condition code
> DR is present.*
>
> *When a provider is unable to submit a start of care OASIS for an
> admission period of care, they should submit the HIPPS code weighted
> closest to 1. For a period of continuing care, when a provider is
> unable to submit a follow-up OASIS, they should carry forward the last
> HIPPS code generated from the previous OASIS.*
>
> *If as a result of disaster conditions, OASIS submission timeframes
> are relaxed, HHAs should submit claims without condition code DR as
> soon as the OASIS was submitted. In this case, matching OASIS
> assessment information and the occurrence code 50 date are required to
> ensure Medicare pays the claim accurately.*
>
> HHAs that are adjusting previously paid claims enter one of the
> condition codes representing Claim Change Reasons (code values D0
> through E0). If adjusting the claim to correct a HIPPS code, HHAs use
> condition code D2 and enter "Remarks" indicattheing the reason for the
> HIPPS code change. HHAs use D9 if multiple changes are necessary.
>
> When submitting an HH PPS claim as a demand bill, HHAs use condition
> code 20. See
>
> §50 for more detailed instructions regarding demand billing.
>
> When submitting an HH PPS claim for a denial notice, HHAs use
> condition code 21. See
>
> §60 for more detailed instructions regarding no-payment billing.
>
> Required - If canceling the claim (TOB 0328), HHAs report the
> condition codes D5 or D6 and enter "Remarks" indicating the reason for
> cancellation of the claim.
>
> Occurrence Codes and Dates
>
> Required -- The HHA enters occurrence code 50 and the date the OASIS
> assessment corresponding to the period of care was completed (OASIS
> item M0090). If occurrence code 50 is not reported on a claim or
> adjustment, the claim will be returned to the provider for
> correction*, unless condition code DR is present to indicate a waiver
> of OASIS reporting is in effect.*
>
> On claims for initial periods of care (i.e. when the From and
> Admission dates match), the HHA reports an inpatient admission that
> ended within 14 days of the "From" date by using one of the following

> Required - For initial periods of care, the HHA reports on the 0023
> revenue code line the date of the first covered visit provided during
> the period. For subsequent periods, the HHA reports on the 0023
> revenue code the date of the first visit provided during the period,
> regardless of whether the visit was covered or non-covered.
>
> For other line items detailing all services within the period, the HHA
> reports service dates as appropriate to that revenue code. For service
> visits that begin in 1 calendar day and span into the next calendar
> day, report one visit using the date the visit ended as the service
> date.
>
> When the claim Admission Date matches the Statement Covers "From"
> Date, Medicare systems ensure that the Service Date on the 0023
> revenue code line also matches these dates.
>
> Service Units
>
> Required - Transaction standards require the reporting of a number
> greater than zero as the units on the 0023 revenue code line. However,
> Medicare systems will disregard the submitted units in processing the
> claim. For line items detailing all services within the period, the
> HHA reports units of service as appropriate to that revenue code.
> Coding detail for each revenue code under HH PPS is defined above
> under Revenue Codes.
>
> For the revenue codes that represent home health visits (042x, 043x,
> 044x, 055x, 056x, and 057x), the HHA reports as service units a number
> of 15 minute increments that comprise the time spent treating the
> beneficiary. Time spent completing the OASIS
>
> assessment in the home as part of an otherwise covered and billable
> visit and time spent updating medical records in the home as part of
> such a visit may also be reported.
>
> Visits of any length are to be reported, rounding the time to the
> nearest 15-minute increment. If any visits report over 96 units (over
> 24 hours) on a single line item, Medicare systems return the claim
> returned to the provider.
>
> Covered and noncovered increments of the same visit must be reported
> on separate lines. This is to ensure that only covered increments are
> included in the per-unit based calculation of outlier payments.
>
> Total Charges
>
> Required - The HHA must report zero charges on the 0023 revenue code
> line (the field must contain zero).
>
> For line items detailing all services within the period of care, the
> HHA reports charges as appropriate to that revenue code. Coding detail
> for each revenue code under HH PPS is defined above under Revenue
> Codes. Charges may be reported in dollars and cents (i.e., charges are
> not required to be rounded to dollars and zero cents). Medicare claims
> processing systems will not make any payments based upon submitted
> charge amounts.
>
> Non-covered Charges
>
> Required -- The HHA reports the total non-covered charges pertaining
> to the related revenue code here. Examples of non-covered charges on
> HH PPS claims may include:

-   Visits provided exclusively to perform OASIS assessments

-   Visits provided exclusively for supervisory or administrative
    > purposes

-   Therapy visits provided prior to the required re-assessments Payer

>
> Conditional - Treatment authorization codes are not required on all

> subject to Pre-Claim Review. In that case, the required tracking
> number is submitted in the first position of the field in all
> submission formats.
>
> Document Control Number (DCN)
>
> Required - If submitting an adjustment (TOB 0327) to a previously paid
> HH PPS claim, the HHA enters the control number assigned to the
> original HH PPS claim here.
>
> Employer Name
>
> Required only if MSP involved. See Pub. 100-05, Medicare Secondary
> Payer Manual. Principal Diagnosis Code
>
> Required - The HHA enters the ICD code for the principal diagnosis.
> The code must be reported according to Official ICD Guidelines for
> Coding and Reporting, as required by the HIPAA. The code must be the
> full diagnosis code, including all five digits for ICD-9- CM or all
> seven digits for ICD-10 CM where applicable. Where the proper code has
> fewer than the maximum number of digits, the HHA does not fill it with
> zeros.
>
> Medicare systems may return claims to the provider when the principal
> diagnosis code is not sufficient to determine the HHRG assignment
> under the PDGM.
>
> The ICD code and principle diagnosis used for payment grouping is
> determined from claim coding rather than the OASIS assessment. As a
> result, the claim and OASIS diagnosis codes are not expected to match
> in all cases.
>
> Typically, the codes will match between the first claim in an
> admission and the start of care (Reason for Assessment --RFA 01)
> assessment and claims corresponding to recertification (RFA 04)
> assessments. Second 30-day claims in any 60-day period will not
> necessarily match the OASIS assessment. When diagnosis codes change
> between one 30-day claim and the next, there is no absolute
> requirement for the HHA to complete an 'other follow-up' (RFA 05)
> assessment to ensure that diagnosis coding on the claim matches to the
> assessment. However, the HHA would be required to complete an 'other
> follow-up' (RFA 05) assessment when such a change would be considered
> a major decline or improvement in the patient's health status.
>
> Other Diagnosis Codes
>
> Required - The HHA enters the full diagnosis codes for additional
> conditions if they coexisted at the time of the establishment of the
> plan of care. These codes may not duplicate the principal diagnosis as
> an additional or secondary diagnosis.
>
> In listing the diagnoses, the HHA places them in order to best reflect
> the seriousness of the patient's condition and to justify the
> disciplines and services provided in accordance with the Official ICD
> Guidelines for Coding and Reporting. The sequence of codes should
> follow ICD guidelines for reporting manifestation codes. Medicare does
> not have any additional requirements regarding the reporting or
> sequence of the codes beyond those contained in ICD guidelines.
>
> The claim and OASIS diagnosis codes may vary as described under
> Principal Diagnosis.
>
> Diagnosis codes that reflect the patient's condition as of the start
> of a period of care are reflected on the claim for the current period
> of care. Diagnosis codes that reflect a change in the patient's
> condition during a period of care should be reflected on the claim for
> the next period.
>
> Attending Provider Name and Identifiers
>
> Required - The HHA enters the name and national provider identifier
> (NPI) of the attending physician who signed the plan of care.
>
> Other Provider (Individual) Names and Identifiers
>
> Required - The HHA enters the name and NPI of the physician who
> certified/re-certified the patient's eligibility for home health
> services.
>
> NOTE: Both the attending physician and other provider fields should be
> completed unless the patient's designated attending physician is the
> same as the physician who
>
> certified/re-certified the patient's eligibility. When the attending
> physician is also the certifying/re-certifying physician, only the
> attending physician is required to be reported.
>
> Remarks
>
> Conditional -- If the NOA that corresponds to a claim was filed late
> and the HHA is requesting an exception to the late-filing penalty (see
> section 10.1.10.3), enter information supporting the exception
> category that applied to the NOA.
>
> The HHA shall provide sufficient information in the Remarks section of
> its claim to allow the contractor to research the case. If the remarks
> are not sufficient, Medicare contractors shall request documentation.
> Documentation should consist of printouts or screen images of any
> Medicare systems screens that contain the information shown above.
>
> Medicare contractors shall not grant exceptions if:

-   the HHA can correct the NOA without waiting for Medicare systems
    actions

-   the HHA submits a partial NOA to fulfill the timely-filing
    requirement, or

-   HHA with multiple provider identifiers submit the identifier of a
    location that did not actually provide the service

> In the great majority of cases, the five day timely filing period
> allows enough time to submit NOAs on a day when Medicare systems are
> available (i.e. the period allows for (\"dark days\"). Additionally,
> the receipt date is typically applied to the NOA immediately upon

## 50 - Beneficiary-Driven Demand Billing Under HH PPS

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> Demand billing is a procedure through which beneficiaries can request
> Medicare payment for services that: (1) their HHAs advised them were
> not medically reasonable and necessary, or that (2) they failed to
> meet the homebound, intermittent or noncustodial care requirements,
> and therefore would not be reimbursed if billed. The HHA must inform
> the beneficiary of this assessment in an Advance Beneficiary Notice of
> Noncoverage (ABN), which also must be signed by the beneficiary or
> appropriate representative. Instructions for the ABN are found in
> chapter 30 of this manual.
>
> Beneficiaries pay out of pocket or third party payers cover the
> services in question, but HHAs in return, upon request of the
> beneficiary, are required to bill Medicare for the disputed services.
> If, after its review, Medicare decides some or all the disputed
> services received on the "demand bill" are covered and pays for them,
> the HHA would refund the previously collected funds for these
> services. If the Medicare determination upholds the HHA's judgment
> that the services were not medically reasonable and necessary, or that
> the beneficiary failed to meet the homebound or intermittent care
> requirements, the HHA keeps the funds collected, unless the A/B MAC
> (HHH) determines the ABN notification was not properly executed, or
> some other factor changed liability for payment of the disputed
> services back to the HHA.

A.  Interval of Billing

> The Medicare payment unit for home care under the home health
> prospective payment system (HH PPS) is a period of care, usually 30
> days in length. A Notice of Admission (NOA) must be submitted for a
> beneficiary before any claims can be processed. A claim is submitted
> for every 30 days of HH services. This does not change in demand bill
> situations.

B.  Timeliness of Billing

> Medicare requests that HHAs submit demand bills promptly. Timely
> filing requirements apply to HH PPS claims in the same manner as other
> claims (see chapter 1 for information on timely filing). Medicare has
> defined "promptly" for HH PPS to mean submission at the end of the
> period of care in question. The beneficiary must also be given either
> a copy of the claim or a written statement of the date the claim was
> submitted.

C.  Claim Requirements

> HH PPS claims, including demand bills, are submitted with TOB 0329,
> and provide all other information required on that claim for the HH
> PPS period of care, including all visit-specific detail. The HHA must
> NOT use TOB 0320 when submitting a demand bill. The HHA must report
> condition code "20" and the services in dispute shown as noncovered
> line items. Demand bills may be submitted with all noncovered charges.
>
> Provision of this additional information assures medical review of the
> demand bill.
>
> Cases may arise in which the services in dispute are visits for which
> an HHA has physician's orders, but the duration of the visits exceeds
> Medicare coverage limits. However, the portion of these visits that is
> not covered by Medicare may be covered by another payer (e.g., an
> 8-hour home health aide visit in which the first 2 hours may be
> covered by Medicare and the remaining 6 hours may be covered by other
> insurance). In such cases, HHAs must submit these visits on demand
> bills as two line items. One line will represent the portion
> potentially covered by Medicare with a covered charge amount and units
> reporting the Medicare-covered visit time. The second line will
> represent the
>
> portion to be submitted for consideration by other insurance with a
> noncovered charge amount and units reporting non-Medicare visit time.
>
> Cases may also arise in which a State Medicaid program requests the
> demand bill on the beneficiary's behalf regarding services which have
> been billed to Medicaid. In these cases, the dates of service for
> which the State requests the demand bill may not correspond exactly to
> the periods billed to Medicare. These cases require special
> instructions:
>
> Requests regarding services not expected to be billed to Medicare:
>
> A Medicare-Medicaid dually-eligible patient may be admitted to home
> care with the expectation that no services will be billed to Medicare.
> Later, the State may request demand bills beginning during the course
> of that care. This may occur when requests correspond to a calendar
> year. For example, the patient may be admitted in December and the
> request for demand bills is effective January 1. In this case, the HHA
> should submit a demand bill to Medicare with period of care dates that
> began in December. All services should be submitted as non-covered
> line items. As with any demand bill, condition code 20 should be
> reported on this claim.
>
> Request applies to services immediately following Medicare discharge:
>
> A dually-eligible patient may be discharged from Medicare home health
> services before the end of a 30-day period of care due to the patient
> meeting their treatment goals. The patient may remain under the care
> of the HHA receiving services billed to Medicaid.
>
> States may vary in their requirements for a new Start of Care OASIS
> assessment in these cases.
>
> If the State requesting a demand bill for the services within the
> original 30-day period of care does not require a new OASIS
> assessment, the HHA should submit an adjustment to their previously
> paid Medicare claim, using TOB 0327. The HHA should add condition code
> 20 to the adjustment claim, change the statement "Through" date to
> reflect the full 30-day period and add the services provided during
> the demand bill request period as non-covered line items. The HHA
> should then submit claims with condition code 20 and all non-covered
> line items for any periods of continuous care within the demand bill
> request period.
>
> If the State requesting a demand bill for the services within the
> 30-day period of care requires a new OASIS assessment, the HHA should
> submit an NOA and submit claims with condition code 20 as they would
> for any other demand bill situation. When Medicare receives the NOA
> for the demand billed episode it will cause a partial period payment
> adjustment to apply to the prior period. Medicare cannot presume that
> the demand billed period will or will not be covered based on the NOA.
> If the claim for the demand billed period is later reviewed and found
> to be entirely non-covered, Medicare systems will automatically adjust
> the prior period to restore the appropriate full episode payment.

D.  Favorable Determinations and Medicare Payment

> Results of Medicare determinations favorable to the party requesting
> the demand bill will not necessarily result in increased Medicare
> payment. In such cases, and even if a favorable determination is made
> but payment does not change, HHAs will still refund any monies
> collected from beneficiaries or other payers for services previously
> thought not medically necessary under Medicare. Medicare payment will
> change only with the addition of covered visits if one or more of the
> following conditions apply:

-   An increase in the number of overall visits that either:

    1.  Changes payment from a low-utilization payment adjustment to a
        > full period payment; or

    2.  Results in the period of care meeting the threshold for outlier
        > payment.

-   A favorable ruling on a demand bill adds days to a claim paid a
    > partial period payment adjustment.

> If a favorable determination is made, A/B MACs (HHH) will assure
> pricing of the claim occurs after medical review so that claims also
> serving as demand bills receive appropriate payment.

E.  Appeals

> Appeal of Medicare determinations made on HH PPS claims also serving
> as demand bills is accomplished by appealing the HH PPS claim. Such
> appeals are done in accordance with regulations stipulating appeals
> rights for Medicare home health claims.

F.  Specific Demand Billing Scenarios

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Independent Assessment \-- Billing questions relative to the ABN and
    home health assessments. With regard to payment liability for the
    assessment itself, the assessment is a non-covered service that is
    not a Medicare benefit and is never separately payable by Medicare.
    In all such cases, a choice remains: The provider may or may not
    decide to hold the beneficiary liable, and Medicare cannot specify
    which is appropriate because the service at issue is outside
    Medicare\'s scope.

> If a decision is made to hold a beneficiary liable for just the
> assessment, Medicare providers must be in compliance with the home
> health Conditions of Participation (COPs), as follows:
>
> 42 CFR 484.10.e (1) The patient has the right to be advised, before
> care is initiated, of the extent to which payment for the HHA services
> may be expected
>
> from Medicare or other sources, and the extent to which payment may be
> required from the patient. Before care is initiated, the HHA must
> inform the patient, orally and in writing, of: (i) The extent to which
> payment may be expected from Medicare, Medicaid or any other Federally
> funded or aided program known to the HHA; (ii) The charges for
> services that will not be covered by Medicare; and (iii) The charges
> that the individual has to pay.
>
> Therefore, while no notice may be required if the provider chooses to
> be liable, the conditions state a notice is required if the
> beneficiary is to be held liable, and must be delivered prior to the
> service in question. ABNs can be used for this purpose.

2.  Billing in Excess of the Benefit. In some states, the Medicaid
    program will cover more hours of care in a week than the Medicare
    benefit. Therefore, an HHA may be billing hours/visits in excess of
    the benefit during a Medicare home health period of care for a
    dually eligible beneficiary. Since the care delivered in excess of
    the benefit is not part of the benefit, and does not affect the
    amount of Medicare's prospectively set payment, there is no dispute
    as to liability, and an ABN is not required unless a triggering
    event occurs; that is, care in excess of the benefit is not a
    triggering event in and of itself requiring an ABN. Billing services
    in excess of the benefit is discussed in C in this section.

3.  One-Visit Periods. Since intermittent skilled nursing care is a
    requirement of the Medicare home health benefit, questions often
    arise as to the billing of one-visit periods of care. Medicare
    claims systems will process such billings, but these billings should
    only be done when some factor potentially justifies the medical
    necessity of the service relative to the benefit.

> Many of these cases do not even need to be demand billed, because
> coverage is not in doubt, since physician orders called for delivery
> of the benefit. When the beneficiary dies after only one visit is a
> clear-cut example. When physician orders called for additional
> services, but the beneficiary died before more services could be
> delivered, the delivery of only one visit is covered. The death is
> indicated on the claim with use of patient status code 20. Other cases
> in which orders called for additional services, but circumstances
> prevented delivery of more than one service by the HHA, are also
> appropriately billed to Medicare in the same fashion.
>
> There may be rare cases where, even though orders do not clearly
> indicate the need for additional services, the HHA feels delivery of
> the service is medically justified by Medicare's standard, and should
> be covered. In such situations, when doubt exists, an HHA should still
> give the beneficiary an ABN if a triggering event has occurred,
> explaining Medicare may not cover the service, and then demand bill
> the service in question.
>
> No billing is required when there is no dispute that the one service
> called for on the order does not meet the requirements for the
> Medicare home health benefit, or is not medically necessary. However,
> there are options for billing these non-covered services as discussed
>
> in chapter 1, section 60 of this manual. Note the COPs may require
> notification in this situation if the beneficiary is to be held
> liable, as discussed in number 1, immediately above.

## 60 - No Payment Billing

### (Rev.11341; Issued:04-07-22; Effective: 10-01-22; Implementation: 10-03-22)

> Home health agencies may seek denials for entire claims from Medicare
> in cases where a provider knows all services will not be covered by
> Medicare. Such denials are usually sought because of the requirements
> of other payers for providers to obtain Medicare denial notices before
> they will consider providing additional payment. Such claims are often
> referred to as no-payment bills or billings for denial notice.

A.  Submission and Processing

> In order to submit a no-payment bill to Medicare under HH PPS,
> providers must use TOB 0320, and condition code 21. Claims with
> condition code 21 and any other TOB will be returned to the provider
> for correction. A Notice of Admission (TOB 032A) is not required
> before the submission of a claim with TOB 0320 and condition code 21.
>
> The statement dates on the claim should conform to the billing period
> they plan to submit to the other payer, insuring that no future date
> is reported. Providers must also submit the charge for each line item
> on the claim as a non-covered charge.
>
> In order for these claims to process through the subsequent HH PPS
> edits in the system, providers are instructed to submit a 0023 revenue
> line on the claim. If no OASIS assessment was done or if the HHA
> chooses not to perform payment grouping before submitting the claim,
> report any valid HIPPS code.
>
> The claim must meet other minimum Medicare requirements. If an OASIS
> assessment was done and the HHA chooses to perform payment grouping
> for their internal accounting purposes, the HHA may report the
> resulting HIPPS code.

B.  Simultaneous Covered and Non-Covered Services

> In some cases, providers may need to obtain a Medicare denial notice
> for non-covered services delivered in the same period as covered
> services that are part of an HH PPS period of care. In such cases, the
> provider should submit a non-payment bill according to the
> instructions above for the non-covered services alone, AND submit the
> appropriate NOA and claim for the HH PPS period of care. The period
> billed under the HH PPS claim and the non-payment bill should be the
> same. Medicare standard systems and the CWF will allow such duplicate
> claims to process when all services on one claim are non- covered.

C.  Custodial Care under HH PPS, or Termination of the Benefit during a
    Period

> In certain cases, Medicare allows the use of no payment claims in
> association with an ABN involving custodial care and termination of a
> benefit during a period of care. This does not apply to cases in which
> a determination is being requested as to the beneficiary's homebound
> status at the beginning of a period of care; there an ABN must be used
> assuming a triggering event occurs (i.e., the initiation of completely
> noncovered care).
>
> However, in cases where the HH plan of care prescribes only custodial
> care, or if the benefit has terminated during a previous period, and
> the physician, beneficiary, and provider are all in agreement the
> benefit has terminated or does not apply, home health agencies (HHAs)
> can use:

1.  The ABN for notification of the beneficiary, and,

2.  A condition code 21 no-payment claim to bill all subsequent
    > services.

## - General

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> Home health services billed on TOB 032x are reimbursed based on
> calculations made by the HH Pricer. The HH Pricer is a module within
> Medicare claims processing systems. The HH Pricer makes all payment
> calculations applicable under HH PPS, including claim payments for

> utilization payment adjustments (LUPAs), partial period payment
> adjustments, and outlier payments.
>
> Medicare claims processing systems send an input record to Pricer for
> all claims with covered visits, and Pricer will return an output
> record to the shared systems. The following sections describe the
> elements of HH PPS claims that are used in the HH PPS Pricer and the
> logic that is used to make payment determinations. No part of the
> Pricer logic is required to be incorporated into an HHA's billing
> system in order to bill Medicare. The following is presented for A/B

## - Decision Logic Used by the Pricer on Claims

### (Rev. 10919, Issued:08-06-21, Effective:01-01-22, Implementation: 01-03-22)

> On input records with TOB 329, 327, 32F, 32G, 32H, 32I, 32J, 32K, 32M,
> 32Q, 33Q or
>
> 32P (that is, all provider submitted claims and provider or A/B MAC
> (HHH) initiated adjustments), Pricer will perform the following
> calculations in the numbered order.
>
> If the "SERV-FROM-DATE" is on or after January 1, 2020, the Pricer
> shall perform the following:
>
> Prior to these calculations, determine the applicable Federal standard
> rate to apply by reading the value in "INIT-PAY-QRP-INDICATOR." If the

> data.

1.  Low Utilization Payment Adjustment (LUPA) calculation.

    1.  If the "REVENUE-SUM1-6-QTY-ALL" is less than the LUPA threshold
        > associated with the "HRG-INPUT-CODE" (e.g. threshold is 6, sum
        > is 5 or less), read the national standard per visit rates for
        > each of the six "REVENUE-QTY-COV-VISITS" fields from the
        > revenue code table for the calendar year in which the
        > "SERV-THRU-DATE" falls. Multiply each quantity by the
        > corresponding rate. Wage index adjust each value and report
        > the payment in the associated "REVENUE-COST" field.

    2.  If the following conditions are met, calculate an additional
        > LUPA add-on payment:

        -   the dates in the "SERV-FROM-DATE" and "ADMIT-DATE" fields
            > match

        -   the first position of the HIPPS code is a 1 or a 2

        -   the value in "LUPA-SRC-ADM" is not a B AND

        -   the value in "RECODE-IND" is not a 2.

> Compare the earliest line item dates for revenue codes 042x, 044x and
> 055x and select the revenue code with the earliest date.
>
> If the earliest date for revenue codes 042x, 043x (CY 2022 and after)
> or 044x match the revenue code 055x date, select revenue code 055x.
>
> If the earliest date for revenue codes 042x and 044x match and revenue
> code 055x is not present, select revenue code 042x.
>
> For claims with Through dates on or after January 1, 2022:
>
> If the earliest date for revenue codes 042x and 043x match and revenue
> code 055x is not present, select revenue code 042x.
>
> If the earliest date for revenue codes 043x and 044x match and revenue
> code 055x is not present, select revenue code 043x.

3.  Apply the appropriate LUPA add-on factor to the selected earliest
    > dated line.

    -   If revenue code 055x, multiply the national per-visit amount by
        > 1.8451.

    -   If revenue code 042x, multiply the national per-visit amount by
        > 1.6700.

    -   If revenue code 043x, multiply the national per-visit amount by
        > 1.6700.

    -   If revenue code 044x, multiply the national per-visit amount by
        > 1.6266.

> Return the resulting payment amount in the "REVENUE-ADD-ON- VISIT-AMT"
> field.

4.  ​Return the sum of all "REVENUE-COST" amounts and the "REVENUE-
    > ADD-ON-VISIT-AMT" amount, if applicable, in the "TOTAL- PAYMENT"
    > field. If the LUPA payment includes LUPA add-on amount, return 14
    > in the "PAY-RTC" field. Otherwise, return 06 in the "PAY- RTC"
    > field. No further calculations are required.

5.  If "REVENUE-SUM1-6-QTY-ALL" is greater than or equal to the LUPA
    > threshold associated with the "HRG-INPUT-CODE", proceed to the HRG
    > payment calculation in step 2.

```
2.  HRG payment calculations.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  If the "PEP-IND" is an N:

> Find the weight for the "HRG-INPUT-CODE" from the weight table for the
> calendar year in which the "SERV-THRU-DATE" falls. Multiply the weight
> times the applicable period of care rate for the calendar year in
> which the "SERV-THRU-DATE" falls. The product is the case-mix adjusted
> rate.
>
> Multiply the case-mix adjusted rate by the current labor-related
> percentage to determine the labor portion. Multiply the labor portion
> by the wage index corresponding to the "CBSA" field. Multiply the
> case-mix adjusted rate by the current nonlabor-related percentage to
> determine the nonlabor portion. Sum the labor and nonlabor portions.
> The sum is the wage index and case-mix adjusted payment for this HRG.
> Proceed to the outlier calculation in step 3.

2.  If the "PEP-INDICATOR" is a Y:

> Perform the calculation of the case-mix and wage index adjusted
> payment for the HRG amount, as in 3.1. Determine the proportion to be
> used to calculate this PEP by dividing the "PEP-DAYS" amount by 30.
> Multiply the case-mix and wage index adjusted payment by this
> proportion. The
>
> result is the partial period payment due on the claim. Proceed to the
> outlier calculation in step 3.

1.  Outlier calculation:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Wage index adjust the outlier fixed loss amount for the Federal
    > fiscal year in which the "SERV-THRU-DATE" falls, using the CBSA
    > code in the "CBSA" field. Add the resulting wage index adjusted
    > fixed loss amount to the total dollar amount resulting from the
    > HRG payment calculation. This is the outlier threshold for the
    > period.

2.  ​For each quantity in the six "REVENUE-QTY- OUTLIER-UNITS" fields,
    > read the national standard per unit rates from the revenue code
    > table for the year in which the "SERV-THRU-DATE" falls. Multiply
    > each quantity by the corresponding rate. Sum the six results and
    > wage index adjust this sum as described above, using the CBSA code
    > in the "CBSA" field. The result is the wage index adjusted imputed
    > cost for the period.

3.  Subtract the outlier threshold from the imputed cost.

4.  If the result determined in step 3.3 is greater than \$0.00,
    > calculate .80 times the result. This is the outlier payment
    > amount.

5.  ​Determine whether the outlier payment is subject to the 10% annual
    > limitation on outliers as follows:

    -   Multiply the amount in the "PROV-PAYMENT-TOTAL" field by 10
        > percent to determine the HHA's outlier limitation amount.

    -   Deduct the amount in the "PROV-OUTLIER-PAY-TOTAL" from the
        > outlier limitation amount. This result is the available
        > outlier pool for the HHA.

    -   If the available outlier pool is greater than or equal to the
        > outlier payment amount calculated in step 3.4, return the
        > outlier payment amount in the "OUTLIER-PAYMENT" field. Add
        > this amount to the total dollar amount resulting from HRG
        > payment calculation. Return the sum in the "TOTAL-PAYMENT"
        > field, with return code 01.

    -   If the available outlier pool is less than the outlier payment
        > amount calculated in step 3.4, return no payment amount in the
        > "OUTLIER- PAYMENT" field. Assign return code 02 to this
        > record.

> a\. If the result determined in step 3.3 is less than or equal to
> \$0.00, the total dollar amount resulting from all HRG payment
> calculations is the total payment. Return zeroes in the
> "OUTLIER-PAYMENT" field. Return
>
> the HRG payment amount in the "TOTAL-PAYMENT" field, with return code
> 00.

1.  Late-filed NOA payment penalty:

    1.  If the value in "OVERRIDE-IND" is equal to Y, continue to step
        > 5.

    2.  If the span of days between the "FROM-DATE" and "RECEIPT-DATE"
        > is greater than five and the value in"OVERRIDE-IND" is equal
        > to N, reduce the "HRG-PAY" and "OUTLIER-PAYMENT" amounts by
        > the span of days/30.

    3.  ​Subtract the sum of the"HRG-PAY" and "OUTLIER-PAYMENT" amounts
        > reduced by the late-filed NOA penalty from step 4.2 from the
        > sum of the "HRG-PAY" and "OUTLIER-PAYMENT" amounts before the
        > penalty. Return the result in "LATE-SUB-PENALTY-AMT." Continue
        > to step 5.

2.  Value-Based Purchasing Adjustment:

> Multiply all payment amounts by adjustment factor in "PROV-VBP-ADJ-
> FAC." Return the results as the final Medicare payment amounts in all
> appropriate output fields.
>
> Subtract the total payments calculated in steps 2 through 4 from the
> total VBP-adjusted payments calculated in step 5. Return the
> difference in the "VBP-ADJ-AMT" field.

## - Annual Updates to the HH Pricer

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> Rate and weight information used by the HH Pricer is updated
> periodically, usually annually. Updates occur each January, to reflect
> the fact that HH PPS rates are effective for a calendar year. Updates
> may also occur at other points in the year when required by
> legislation. The following update items, when changed, are published
> in the Federal Register:

-   The Federal standard period of care amount;

-   The fixed loss amount to be used for outlier calculations;

-   A table of case-mix weights and LUPA thresholds to be used for each
    > HHRG;

-   A table of national standardized per visit rates and per unit rates;

-   The pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index; and

-   Changes, if any, to the outlier loss-sharing percentage and the
    labor and nonlabor percentages.

> Whenever these update items change, Medicare also publishes a
> Recurring Update Notification to inform providers and A/B MACs (HHH)
> about the changes. These Recurring Update Notifications also describe
> how the changes will be implemented through the HH Pricer.

## -- HH Grouper Program

#### *(Rev. 11644, Issued: 10-13-22, Effective: 04-01-23, Implementation: 04-03-23)*

> The Home Health Resource Group (HHRG) used to pay home health services
> billed on TOB 032x are determined by the HH Grouper program. HHRGs are
> represented on claims in the form of HIPPS codes. Like the HH Pricer,
> the HH Grouper is a module within Medicare claims processing systems.
> The HHA sends a HIPPS code on the claim, using revenue code 0023.
> Medicare systems combine claim data and OASIS data and send the data
> to the HH Grouper to determine the HIPPS code used for payment. The
> HIPPS code from the Grouper replaces the provider-submitted HIPPS code
> on the claim and is then sent to the HH Pricer for payment
> calculations.
>
> Medicare claims processing systems send an input record to Grouper for
> all claims and most adjustments. Medical review or other program
> integrity contractor adjustments are not sent to the Grouper. The
> Grouper returns an output record to the shared systems whenever an
> input record is sent.
>
> No part of the Grouper logic is required to be incorporated into an
> HHA's billing system in order to bill Medicare, unless the HHA chooses
> to do so to assist their accounts receivable functions. The following
> is presented for A/B MACs (HHH) and as information for the HHAs, in
> order to help HHAs understand how their HH claims are processed.

## - Medical and Other Health Services Submitted Using Type of Bill 034x

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> HHAs may submit claims for certain medical and other health services
> which are paid from the Part B trust fund. The HHA may receive payment
> for these services outside of the prospective payment system (see Pub.
> 100-02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 7).

A.  Patient Not Under A Home Health Plan Of Care

> The HHA submits claims with TOB 034x to bill for certain "medical and
> other health services" when there is no home health plan of care.
> Specifically the HHA may bill using TOB 034x for the following
> services. (There must be a physician's certification on file.):

-   Surgical dressings, splints, casts, and other devices used for
    > reduction of fractures and dislocations. (See chapter 20 for
    > billing enteral and parenteral supplies and equipment.)

-   Rental or purchase of DME. (See chapter 20 for billing enteral and
    > parenteral supplies and equipment.)

-   Prosthetic devices. (See chapter 20 for billing enteral and
    > parenteral supplies and equipment.)

-   Leg, arm, back, and neck braces, trusses, and artificial legs, arms,
    > and eyes.

-   Outpatient physical therapy services. (See the Medicare Benefit
    > Policy Manual, chapter 15 and the Medicare Claims Processing
    > Manual, chapter 5.)

-   Outpatient speech-language pathology services. (See the Medicare
    > Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 15 and the Medicare Claims
    > Processing Manual, chapter 5.)

-   Outpatient occupational therapy services. (See the Medicare Benefit
    > Policy Manual, chapter 15 and the Medicare Claims Processing
    > Manual, chapter 5.)

-   Diabetes Outpatient Self-Management Training (DSMT). (See the
    > Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 15, section 300.5.1)

-   Bone Mass Measurements. (See the Medicare Claims Processing Manual,
    > chapter 13, section 140.)

-   Smoking and Tobacco-Use Cessation Counseling Services. (See the
    > Medicare Claims Processing Manual, chapter 32, section 12.)

> Bills for services not under a home health plan of care should be
> submitted only after services are delivered. They should be submitted
> on a periodic basis, e.g., monthly, without regard to a period of
> care. These items are not reimbursed under HH PPS.

B.  The Patient is Under a Home Health Plan of Care

> If a patient is receiving home health services under a plan of care,
> the agency may bill for the following services on TOB 034x:

-   A covered osteoporosis drug,

-   Pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza virus, and hepatitis B vaccines,
    > and

-   Disposable negative pressure wound therapy services.

> All other services are home health services and should be billed as an
> HH PPS period of care with Type of Bill 032x.
>
> DME, orthotic, and prosthetics can be billed as a home health service
> using type of bill 032x or as a medical and other health service using
> type of bill 034x as appropriate.
>
> Alternately, these services may be provided to HH beneficiaries by a
> supplier. Refer to instructions in chapter 20 of this manual for
> submitting claims under arrangement with suppliers.
>
> C Billing Spanning Two Calendar Years
>
> The agency should not submit a medical and other health services bill
> paid from the Part B trust fund (TOB 034x only) for an inclusive
> period beginning in 1 calendar year and extending into the next. If
> the agency does not bill on a calendar month basis, it prepares two
> bills. The first covers the period ending December 31 of the old year;
> the second, the period beginning January 1 of the new year. This
> permits the A/B MAC (HHH) to apply the appropriate deductible for both
> years. HH PPS claims (TOB 032x) may span the calendar year since they
> represent 30-day periods of care.
>
> D Billing For Laboratory Services
>
> HHAs may provide laboratory services only if issued a CLIA number
> and/or having a CLIA certificate of waiver. HHAs do not report
> laboratory services, even when on the HH plan of care, to an A/B MAC
> (A) or (HHH) using an institutional claim format.
>
> These services are always billed to A/B MACs (B) using a professional
> claim format. To submit such claims, the HHA must have a CLIA number
> and a professional billing number. HHAs should contact the State
> Survey Agency to obtain a CLIA number.
>
> HHAs should contact the appropriate MAC to obtain a billing number.
> The survey process is used to validate that laboratory services in an
> HHA facility are being provided in accordance with the CLIA
> certificate.

## - Osteoporosis Injections as HHA Benefit

### (Rev. 10274, Issued: 08-07-2020, Effective: 01-01-2021, Implementation: 01-04-2021)

A.  Billing Requirements

> The administration of the drug is included in the charge for the
> skilled nursing visit billed using TOB 032x. The cost of the drug is
> billed using TOB 034x, using revenue code
>
> 0636\. These drugs are paid on a reasonable cost basis, using the
> provider's submitted charges to make initial payments, which are
> subject to annual cost settlement.
>
> Coverage requirements for osteoporosis drugs are found in Pub. 100-02,
> Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 7, section 50.4.3. Coverage
> requirements for the home health benefit in general are found in Pub.
> 100-02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 7, section 30.
>
> Drugs that have the ingredient calcitonin are billed using HCPCS code
> J0630. HCPCS code J0630 is defined as up to 400 units. Therefore, the
> provider must calculate units for the bill as follows:

+------------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| > Units Furnished During Billing Period  | > Units of Service Entry  |

> Drugs that have the ingredient teriparatide may be billed using HCPCS

>
> Drugs that have the ingredient abaloparatide are billed using HCPCS
> code J3590 (unclassified biologics), if all existing guidelines for
> coverage under the home health benefit are met. As an unclassified
> code, HCPCS code J3590 does have not a standard definition for units.
> Providers should report 1 unit for each 80 mcg dose provided during
> the billing period.
>
> All other osteoporosis drugs that are FDA approved and are awaiting a
> HCPCS code must use the miscellaneous code of J3490 until a specific
> HCPCS code is approved for use.

B.  Edits

> Medicare system edits require that the date of service on a 034x claim
> for covered osteoporosis drugs falls within the start and end dates of
> an existing home health PPS episode. Once the system ensures the
> service dates on the 034x claim fall within an HH PPS episode that is
> open for the beneficiary on CWF, CWF edits to assure that the provider
> number on the 034x claim matches the provider number on the episode
> file.
>
> This is to reflect that although the osteoporosis drug is paid
> separately from the HH PPS episode rate it is included in consolidated
> billing requirements (see [§10.1.25]{.underline} regarding
> consolidated billing).
>
> Claims are also edited to assure that if the claim is an HH claim (TOB
> 034x), the beneficiary is female and that the diagnosis code for
> post-menopausal osteoporosis is present.

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Procedures for billing for pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza virus,
> and Hepatitis B Vaccines is covered in Chapter18.

## -- Billing Instructions for Disposable Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Services

### (Rev. 3655, Issued: 11-10-16, Effective: 01-01-17, Implementation: 01-03-17)

> Effective January 1, 2017, Medicare makes a separate payment amount
> for a disposable negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) device for a
> patient under a home health plan of care. Payment is equal to the
> amount of the payment that would otherwise be made under the
> Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS).
>
> Disposable NPWT services are billed using the following HCPCS codes:

-   97607 - Negative pressure wound therapy, (e.g., vacuum assisted
    drainage collection), utilizing disposable, non-durable medical
    equipment including provision of exudate management collection
    system, topical application(s), wound assessment, and instructions
    for ongoing care, per session; total wound(s) surface area less than
    or equal to 50 square centimeters.

-   97608 - Negative pressure wound therapy, (e.g., vacuum assisted
    drainage collection), utilizing disposable, non-durable medical
    equipment including provision of exudate management collection
    system, topical application(s), wound

> assessment, and instructions for ongoing care, per session; total
> wound(s) surface area greater than 50 square centimeters.
>
> The HHA reports the HCPCS code with one of three revenue codes,
> depending on the practitioner that provided the service:

-   Skilled nurse -- 0559

-   Physical therapist -- 042x

-   Occupational therapy -- 043x.

> When using revenue codes 042x or 043x, the HHA should not use the
> therapy plan of care modifiers (GO or GP) for NPWT services.
>
> These HCPCS codes include payment for both performing the service and
> the disposable NPWT device, which is defined as an integrated system
> comprised of a nonmanual vacuum pump, a receptacle for collecting
> exudate, and dressings for the purposes of wound therapy. Services
> related to the provision of NPWT using a disposable device that do not
> encompass the provision of the entire integrated system should be
> billed per existing HH PPS guidelines.
>
> To avoid duplication of payment, for instances where the sole purpose
> for an HHA visit is to perform NPWT using a disposable device,
> Medicare will not pay for a skilled nursing or therapy visit under the
> HH PPS. Rather, performing NPWT using a disposable device for a
> patient under a home health plan of care is be separately reimbursed
> the OPPS amount. In this situation, the HHA bills only under TOB 034x.
> This visit is not reported on the HH PPS claim (TOB 032x).
>
> If NPWT using a disposable device is performed during the course of an
> otherwise covered home health visit (e.g., to perform a catheter
> change), the visit would be covered as normal. Performing NPWT using a
> disposable device will be separately reimbursed the OPPS amount. In
> this situation, the HHA bills under TOB 034X and this visit is also
> reported on the HH PPS claim (TOB 032x). The HHA must not include the
> time spent performing NPWT in their visit charge or in the length of
> time reported for the visit on the HH PPS claim.

## 100 - Temporary Suspension of Home Health Services

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> A physician may suspend visits for a time to determine whether the
> patient has recovered sufficiently to do without further home health
> services. When the suspension is temporary (does not extend beyond the
> end date of the 60-day certification period) and the physician later
> determines that the services must be resumed, the resumed services are
> paid as part of the same or subsequent 30-day period of care and under
> the same plan of care as before. The admission date remains the same
> on any claims. No special
>
> indication need be made on the claim(s) for the period of suspended
> services. Explanation of the suspension need be indicated only in the
> medical record.
>
> If the suspension extends beyond the end of the current 60-day
> certification, HHAs must submit a discharge claim. Full payment will
> be due for the period of care. If the beneficiary resumes care, the
> HHA must establish a new plan of care and submit an NOA for a new
> admission.

### (Rev. 10758; Issued: 05-11-21; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 08-11-21)

> Medicare regulations allow that payment may be made for home health
> services for up to thirty days after a home health agency (HHA)
> terminates their Medicare provider agreement. This payment may be made
> if the home health services are furnished under a home health plan of
> care established before the effective date of the termination.
>
> Medicare continues to make full period of care payments for periods
> which extend beyond a provider's termination date if the home health
> services are provided under a plan of care established prior to that
> date and if the home health period of care ends within the 30 day
> period.
