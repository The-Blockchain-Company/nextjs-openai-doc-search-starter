### (Rev. 4280, Issued: 04-19-2019, Effective: 07-21-19, Implementation: 07-21-19)

> Medicare beneficiaries entitled to hospital insurance (Part A) who
> have terminal illnesses and a life expectancy of six months or less
> have the option of electing hospice benefits in lieu of standard
> Medicare coverage for treatment and management of their terminal
> condition. Only care provided by a Medicare certified hospice is
> covered under the hospice benefit provisions.
>
> Hospice care is available for two 90-day periods and an unlimited
> number of 60-day periods during the remainder of the hospice patient's
> lifetime. However, a beneficiary may voluntarily terminate his hospice
> election period. Election/termination dates are retained on CWF.
>
> When hospice coverage is elected, the beneficiary waives all rights to
> Medicare Part B payments for services that are related to the
> treatment and management of his/her terminal illness during any period
> his/her hospice benefit election is in force, except for professional
> services of an attending physician, which may include a nurse
> practitioner or physician assistant. If the attending physician, is an
> employee of the designated hospice, he or she may not receive
> compensation from the hospice for those services under Part B. These
> physician professional services are billed to Medicare Part A by the
> hospice.
>
> To be covered, hospice services must be reasonable and necessary for
> the palliation or management of the terminal illness and related
> conditions. The individual must elect hospice care and a certification
> that the individual is terminally ill must be completed by the
> patient's attending physician (if there is one), and the Medical
> Director (or the physician member of the Interdisciplinary Group
> (IDG)). Nurse practitioners or physician assistants serving as the
> attending physician may not certify or re-certify the terminal
> illness. A plan of care must be established before services are
> provided. To be covered, services must be consistent with the plan of
> care. Certification of terminal illness is based on the physician's or
> medical director's clinical judgment regarding the normal course of an
> individual's illness. It should be noted that predicting life
> expectancy is not always exact.

> See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 9, for additional

# - Hospice Pre-Election Evaluation and Counseling Services

> (Rev. 3577, Issued: 08-05-16; Effective: 01-01-17; Implementation:
> 01-03-17)
>
> Effective January 1, 2005, Medicare allows payment to a hospice for
> specified hospice pre-election evaluation and counseling services when
> furnished by a physician who is either the medical director of or
> employee of the hospice.
>
> Medicare covers a [one- time only]{.underline} payment on behalf of a
> beneficiary who is terminally ill, (defined as having a prognosis of 6
> months or less if the disease follows its normal course), has no
> previous hospice elections, and has not previously received hospice
> pre- election evaluation and counseling services.
>
> HCPCS code G0337 "Hospice Pre-Election Evaluation and Counseling
> Services" is used to designate that these services have been provided
> by the medical director or a physician employed by the hospice.
> Hospice agencies bill their A/B MAC (HHH) with home health and hospice
> jurisdiction directly using HCPCS G0337 with Revenue Code 0657. [No
> other revenue codes may appear on the claim.]{.underline}
>
> Claims for "Hospice Pre-Election and Counseling Services", HCPCS code
> G0337, are not subject to the editing usually required on hospice
> claims to match the claim to an established hospice period. Further,
> A/B MACs (HHH) do not apply payments for hospice pre-election
> evaluation and counseling consultation services to the overall hospice
> cap amount.
>
> Medicare must ensure that this counseling service occurs only one time
> per beneficiary by imposing safeguards to detect and prevent duplicate
> billing for similar services. If "new patient" physician services
> (HCPCS codes 99201-99205) are submitted by a A/B MAC (HHH) to CWF for
> payment authorization but HCPCS code G0337 (Hospice Pre- Election
> Evaluation and Counseling Services) has already been approved for a
> hospice claim for the same beneficiary, for the same date of service,
> by the same physician, the physician service will be rejected by CWF
> and the service shall be denied as a duplicate.
>
> The contractor shall use the following remittance advice messages and
> associated codes when rejecting/denying claims under this policy. This
> CARC/RARC combination is compliant with CAQH CORE Business Scenario
> Four.
>
> Group Code: CO CARC: 97 RARC: M86 MSN: 16.45
>
> Likewise, if a "new patient" claim for HCPCS codes 99201-99205 has
> been approved and subsequently, a hospice claim is submitted to CWF
> for payment authorization for HCPCS code G0337, (for same beneficiary,
> same date of service, same physician), CWF shall reject the claim and
> the contractor shall deny the bill and use the messages above.
>
> HCPCS code G0337 is only payable when billed on a hospice claim.
> Contractors shall not make payment for HCPCS code G0337 on
> professional claims. Contractors shall deny line items on professional
> claims for HCPCS code G0337.
>
> The contractor shall use the following remittance advice messages and
> associated codes when rejecting/denying claims under this policy. This
> CARC/RARC combination is compliant with CAQH CORE Business Scenario
> Three.

# - Notice of Election (NOE)

### (Rev. 4152, Issued: 10-26-2018, Effective: 01-01-18, Implementation: 04-01-19)

> When a Medicare beneficiary elects hospice services, hospices must
> complete the data elements identified below for the Uniform
> (Institutional Provider) Bill (Form CMS-1450) or its electronic
> equivalent, which is a Notice of Election (NOE).
>
> Timely-filed hospice NOEs shall be filed within 5 calendar days after
> the hospice admission date. A timely-filed NOE is a NOE that is
> submitted to the A/B MAC (HHH) and accepted by the A/B MAC (HHH)
> within 5 calendar days after the hospice admission date. While a
> timely-filed NOE is one that is submitted to and accepted by the
> Medicare contractor A/B MAC (HHH) within 5 calendar days after the
> hospice election, posting to the CWF may not occur within that same
> time frame. The date of posting to the CWF is not a reflection of
> whether the NOE is considered timely-filed. In instances where a NOE
> is not timely-filed, Medicare shall not cover and pay for the days of
> hospice care from the hospice admission date to the date the NOE is
> submitted to, and accepted by, the A/B MAC (HHH). These days shall be
> a provider liability, and the provider shall not bill the beneficiary
> for them. The hospice shall report these non-covered days on the claim
> with an occurrence span code 77, and charges for all claim lines
> reporting these days shall be reported as non-covered, or the claim
> will be returned to the provider.
>
> If a hospice fails to file a timely-filed NOE, it may request an
> exception which, if approved, waives the consequences of filing a NOE
> late. The four circumstances that may qualify the hospice for an
> exception to the consequences of filing the NOE more than 5 calendar
> days after the hospice admission date are as follows:

1.  fires, floods, earthquakes, or other unusual events that inflict
    > extensive damage to the hospice's ability to operate;

2.  an event that produces a data filing problem due to a CMS or A/B MAC
    > (HHH) systems issue that is beyond the control of the hospice;

3.  a newly Medicare-certified hospice that is notified of that
    > certification after the Medicare certification date, or which is
    > awaiting its user ID from its A/B MAC (HHH); or,

4.  other circumstances determined by the A/B MAC (HHH) or CMS to be
    > beyond the control of the hospice.

> If one of the four circumstances described above prevents a hospice
> from filing a timely- filed NOE, the hospice may request an exception
> which, if approved, would waive the consequences of filing the NOE
> late.
>
> When an NOE is submitted within the five day timely filing period, but
> the NOE contains inadvertent errors (such as a beneficiary identifier
> that has recently changed), the error does not trigger the NOE to be
> immediately returned to the hospice for correction. In these
> instances, the hospice must wait until the incorrect information is
> fully processed by Medicare systems before the NOE is returned to the
> hospice for correction.
>
> There are other NOE errors, such as an incorrect admission date, that
> will not be returned for correction and instead must be finalized and
> posted by the Medicare systems before the hospice can correct the NOE.
> Only the hospice is aware of the error. Such delays in Medicare
> systems could cause the NOE to be late.
>
> Delays due to Medicare system constraints are outside the control of
> the hospice and may qualify for an exception to the timely filing
> requirement.
>
> Medicare contractors shall grant an exception for the late NOE if the
> hospice is able to provide documentation showing:

(1) When the original NOE was submitted;

(2) When the NOE was returned to the hospice for correction or was
    accepted and available for correction and;

(3) Evidence the hospice resubmitted the returned NOE within two
    business days of when it was available for correction or cancelled
    an accepted NOE within two business days and submitted the new NOE
    within two business days after the date that the cancellation NOE
    finalized.

> The hospice shall provide sufficient information in the Remarks
> section of its claim to allow the contractor to research the case. If
> the remarks are not sufficient, Medicare contractors shall request
> documentation. Documentation should consist of printouts or
>
> screen images of any Medicare systems screens that contain the
> information shown above.
>
> Medicare contractors shall not grant exceptions if:

-   the hospice can correct the NOE without waiting for Medicare systems
    > actions

-   the hospice submits a partial NOE to fulfill the timely-filing
    > requirement, or

-   hospices with multiple provider identifiers submit the identifier of
    > a location that did not actually provide the service

> In the great majority of cases, the five day timely filing period
> allows enough time to submit NOEs on a day when Medicare systems are
> available (i.e. the period allows for (\"dark days\"). Additionally,
> the receipt date is typically applied to the NOE immediately upon
> submission to Medicare systems, so subsequent dark days would not
> affect the determination of timeliness. However, f the hospice can
> provide documentation showing an NOE is submitted on the day before a
> dark day period and the NOE does not receive a receipt date until the
> day following the dark days, the contractor shall grant an exception
> to the timely filing requirement. CMS expects these cases to be very
> rare.
>
> Hospices must send the NOE to the A/B MAC (HHH) by mail, electronic
> data interchange (EDI), or direct data entry (DDE) depending upon the
> arrangements with the A/B MAC (HHH). EDI submissions require
> additional data not required by the NOE itself, to satisfy transaction
> standards. This data is described in a companion guide available on
> the CMS website at
> [[www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/Hospice/index.html)
> [[Payment/Hospice/index.html]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/Hospice/index.html).
> Hospices may voluntarily agree to adopt the companion guide and use it
> to submit EDI NOEs at any time.
>
> If a patient enters hospice care before the month he/she becomes
> entitled to Medicare benefits, e.g., before age 65, the hospice should
> not send the NOE before the first day of the month in which he/she
> becomes 65.
>
> Hospices complete the following data elements when submitting an NOE.

### Provider Name, Address, and Telephone Number

> The minimum entry for this item is the provider's name, city, State,
> and ZIP code. The post office box number or street name and number may
> be included. The State may be abbreviated using standard post office
> abbreviations. Five or 9-digit ZIP codes are acceptable. Use the
> information to reconcile provider number discrepancies. Phone and/or
> FAX numbers are desirable.

### Type of Bill

> Enter the appropriate 3-digit numeric type of bill code, according to
> the following code structure:
>
> 81A - Hospice (Nonhospital-Based) Initial Election Notice 82A -
> Hospice (Hospital-Based) Initial Election Notice
>
> **Statement Covers Period** (From-Through)
>
> The hospice enters the From date of this hospice election. A Through
> date is not required on NOEs.

### Patient's Name

> The patient's name is shown with the surname first, first name, and
> middle initial, if any.

### Patient's Address

> The patient's full mailing address including street name and number,
> post office box number or RFD, city, State, and ZIP code.

### Patient's Birth Date

> Show the month, day, and year of birth numerically as MM-DD-YYYY.

### Patient's Sex

> Show an "M" for male or an "F" for female. This item is used in
> conjunction with diagnoses and surgical procedures to identify
> inconsistencies.

### Admission Date

> The hospice enters the admission date, which must be the start date of
> the benefit period. When a new hospice admission occurs after a
> hospice revocation or discharge that resulted in termination of the
> hospice benefit, the new admission date cannot be the same as the
> revocation or discharge date of the previous benefit period.
>
> The date of admission may not precede the physician's certification by
> more than 2 calendar days, and is the same as the certification date
> if the certification is not completed on time.

### EXAMPLE

> The hospice election date (admission) is January 1, 2014. The
> physician's certification is dated January 3, 2014. The hospice date
> for coverage and billing is January 1, 2014. The first hospice benefit
> period ends 90 days from January 1, 2014.
>
> Show the month, day, and year numerically as MM-DD-YY.

### Condition Codes

> Condition codes are not required on an original NOE. If the hospice is
> correcting an election date using occurrence code 56, the hospice
> reports condition code D0. If the two codes are not reported together,
> the NOE will be returned to the hospice.

### Occurrence Codes and Dates

> The hospice reports occurrence code 27 and the date of certification.
> This date must match the From Date and Admission Date.
>
> Hospices may submit an NOE that corrects an election date previously
> submitted in error. In this case, the hospice reports the correct
> election date in the From Date, Admission Date and occurrence code 27
> fields and reports the original, incorrect election date using
> occurrence code 56. Medicare systems use the original, incorrect date
> to find the election record to be corrected, then replaces that
> election date with the corrected information.

### Release of Information Valid values are:

> **Provider Number**
>
> The hospice enters their NPI.

### Insured's Name

> Send all NOEs with Medicare as the primary payer. Enter the
> beneficiary's name on line
>
> A. Show the name exactly as it appears on the beneficiary's HI card.

### Certificate/Social Security Number and Health Insurance Claim/Identification Number

> On the same lettered line (A, B, or C) that corresponds to the line on
> which Medicare payer information is shown enter the patient's HICN.
> For example, if Medicare is the primary payer, enter this information.
> To ensure accuracy and prevent a delay in posting the hospice notice
> of election, hospices should validate this information using the
> Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
> Eligibility Transaction System (HETS). Only in the event that the HETS
> data is not available should the hospice show the number as it appears
> on the patient's HI Card, Social Security Award Certificate,
> Utilization Notice, EOMB, Temporary Eligibility Notice, etc., or as
> reported by the SSO.

### Principal Diagnosis Code

> CMS accepts only HIPAA approved ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM/ICD-10-PCS
> codes, depending on the date of service. The official ICD-9-CM codes,
> which were updated
>
> annually through October 1, 2013, are posted at
> [[http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/codes.html]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/codes.html)
>
> The official annual updates to ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes are
> posted at
> [[http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/index.html]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/index.html)
> .
>
> Use full diagnosis codes including all applicable digits, up to five
> digits for ICD-9-CM and up to seven digits for ICD-10-CM.

### Attending Physician I.D.

> For notice of elections effective prior to January 1, 2010, the
> hospice enters the National Provider Identifier (NPI) and name of the
> physician currently responsible for certifying the terminal illness,
> and signing the individual's plan of care for medical care and
> treatment.
>
> The reporting requirement, optional for notice of elections effective
> on or after January 1, 2010, and required reporting on or after April
> 1, 2010, establishes that the hospice enters the NPI and name of the
> attending physician designated by the patient at the time of election
> as having the most significant role in the determination and delivery
> of the patient's medical care.

### Other Physician I.D.

> The hospice enters the NPI and name of the hospice physician
> responsible for certifying that the patient is terminally ill, with a
> life expectancy of 6 months or less if the disease runs its normal
> course. Note: Both the attending physician and other physician fields
> should be completed unless the patient's designated attending
> physician is the same as the physician certifying the terminal
> illness. When the attending physician is also the physician certifying
> the terminal illness, only the attending physician is required to be
> reported.

### Provider Representative Signature and Date

> A hospice representative must make sure the required physician's
> certification, and a signed hospice election statement are in the
> records before signing the Form CMS-1450. A stamped signature is
> acceptable.

# - Notice of Termination/Revocation (NOTR)

### (Rev.10485, Issued: 11-19-20, Effective: 09-07-2020, Implementation: 12-01-2020)

> NOTR is used when the hospice beneficiary is discharged alive from the
> hospice or revokes the election of hospice services. An NOTR should
> not be used when a patient is transferred.
>
> If a hospice beneficiary is discharged alive or if a hospice
> beneficiary revokes the election of hospice care, the hospice shall
> file a timely-filed Notice of Election Termination / Revocation
> (NOTR), unless it has already filed a final claim. A timely- filed
> NOTR is a NOTR that is submitted to the A/B MAC (HHH) and accepted by
> the A/B MAC (HHH) within 5 calendar days after the effective date of
> discharge or revocation. While a timely-filed NOTR is one that is
> submitted to and accepted by the A/B MAC (HHH) within 5 calendar days
> after the hospice election, posting to the CWF may not occur within
> that same timeframe. The date of posting to the CWF is not a
> reflection of whether the NOTR is considered timely-filed.
>
> *In order for the NOTR to be accepted into the system, an election
> period must be established. If the notice of election, which creates
> the hospice election period is not submitted and posted before the
> NOTR, the NOTR will be rejected.*

### Type of Bill

> Enter the appropriate 3-digit numeric type of bill code, according to
> the following code structure:
>
> 81B- Hospice (Nonhospital-Based) NOTR 82B- Hospice (hospital-Based)
> NOTR **Statement Covers Period** (From-Through)
>
> The hospice submits the From date on an NOTR differently in the
> following scenarios:

-   When there is no change in the provider number during the election,
    > the hospice must submit the start date of the election period as
    > the From date on the NOTR.

-   If the revocation follows a transfer, the From date on the NOTR must
    > match the START DATE2 on the benefit period that initiated the
    > transfer.

-   If the revocation follows a change of ownership, the From date on
    > the NOTR must match the OWNER CHANGE start date on the benefit
    > periods. This process is to ensure that only the provider
    > currently providing services to the beneficiary can submit the
    > NOTR.

> In all cases, the Admission Date on the NOTR must match the From date.

### Patient's Name

> The patient's name is shown with the surname first, first name, and
> middle initial, if any.

### Patient's Address

> The patient's full mailing address including street name and number,
> post office box number or RFD, city, State, and ZIP code.

### Patient's Birth Date

> Show the month, day, and year of birth numerically as MM-DD-YYYY.

### Patient's Sex

> Show an "M" for male or an "F" for female. This item is used in
> conjunction with diagnoses and surgical procedures to identify
> inconsistencies.

### Admission Date

> The hospice enters the admission date, which must be the start date of
> the benefit period in all cases except when a transfer occurs.
>
> On a NOTR, the hospice enters the start date of the hospice benefit
> period in which the discharge or revocation is effective, not the
> initial hospice admission date.
>
> Show the month, day, and year numerically as MM-DD-YY.

### Facility Zip Code

> Enter the hospice\'s ZIP code (9-digit). The ZIP code entered must
> match the ZIP code in the Master Address field of the provider\'s
> address file.

### Condition Codes

> Condition codes are not required on an original NOTR. If the hospice
> is correcting a revocation date using occurrence code 56, the hospice
> reports condition code D0. If the two codes are not reported together,
> the NOTR will be returned to the hospice.

### Occurrence Codes and Dates

> Hospices may submit an NOTR that corrects a revocation date previously
> submitted in error. In this case, the hospice reports the correct
> revocation date in the Through Date field and reports the original,
> incorrect revocation date using occurrence code 56.
>
> Medicare systems use the original, incorrect date to find the election
> record to be corrected, then replaces that revocation date with the
> corrected information.
>
> If a revocation date was submitted entirely in error (for instance,
> the beneficiary actually transferred to another hospice, rather than
> revoking their hospice benefit), the hospice can remove the revocation
> date via Direct Data Entry by submitting TOB 8xB with zeroes in the
> Through date. The hospice reports the original, incorrect revocation
> date on the NOTR using occurrence code 56 and indicate the NOTR is a
> correction by adding condition code D0.

### Release of Information

> **Valid values are: I -** Informed consent to release medical
> information for condition or diagnoses regulated by Federal Statutes
> **Y -** Yes, provider has a signed statement permitting release of
> information

### Provider Number

> The hospice enters their NPI. Medicare systems ensure that the
> provider number submitted on the NOTR is the currently active billing
> provider (e.g. the provider number matches that on the hospice
> election period or the most recent transfer date or change of
> ownership date on any benefit period). If any other provider number is
> submitted, the NOTR is returned.

### Insured's Name

> Send all NOEs with Medicare as the primary payer. Enter the
> beneficiary's name on line
>
> A. Show the name exactly as it appears on the beneficiary's HI card.

### Certificate/Social Security Number and Health Insurance Claim/Identification Number

> On the same lettered line (A, B, or C) that corresponds to the line on
> which Medicare payer information is shown enter the patient's HICN.
> For example, if Medicare is the primary payer, enter this information.
> To ensure accuracy and prevent a delay in posting the hospice notice
> of election, hospices should validate this information using the
> Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
> Eligibility Transaction System (HETS). Only in the event that the HETS
> data is not available should the hospice show the number as it appears
> on the patient's HI Card, Social Security Award Certificate,
> Utilization Notice, EOMB, Temporary Eligibility Notice, etc., or as
> reported by the SSO.

### Principal Diagnosis Code

> CMS accepts only HIPAA approved ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM/ICD-10-PCS
> codes, depending on the date of service. The official ICD-9-CM codes,
> which were updated annually through October 1, 2013, are posted at

>
> Use full diagnosis codes including all applicable digits, up to five
> digits for ICD-9-CM and up to seven digits for ICD-10-CM.

### Attending Physician I.D.

> For notice of elections effective prior to January 1, 2010, the
> hospice enters the National Provider Identifier (NPI) and name of the
> physician currently responsible for certifying the terminal illness,
> and signing the individual's plan of care for medical care and
> treatment.
>
> The reporting requirement, optional for notice of elections effective
> on or after January 1, 2010, and required reporting on or after April
> 1, 2010, establishes that the hospice enters the NPI and name of the
> attending physician designated by the patient at the time of election
> as having the most significant role in the determination and delivery
> of the patient's medical care.

### Other Physician I.D.

> The hospice enters the NPI and name of the hospice physician
> responsible for certifying that the patient is terminally ill, with a
> life expectancy of 6 months or less if the disease runs its normal
> course. Note: Both the attending physician and other physician fields
> should be completed unless the patient's designated attending
> physician is the same as the physician certifying the terminal
> illness. When the attending physician is also the physician certifying
> the terminal illness, only the attending physician is required to be
> reported.
>
> **NOTE:** for electronic claims using version 5010 or later, this
> information is reported in Loop ID 2310F -- Referring Provider Name.

### Provider Representative Signature and Date

> A hospice representative must make sure the required physician's
> certification, and a signed hospice election statement are in the
> records before signing the Form CMS-1450. A stamped signature is

# - Change of Provider/Transfer Notice

### (Rev. 11280, Issued: 02-25-22, Effective: 07-01-22 , Implementation: 07-05-22)

> If the beneficiary is transferred to another hospice (discharge status
> codes 50 or 51) the claim does not terminate the beneficiary's current
> hospice benefit period. The admitting hospice submits a transfer
> notice after the transfer has occurred and the beneficiary's hospice
> benefit is not affected. The 8XC does not get submitted until after
> the other provider has finalized their billing.
>
> **NOTE:** Transfers are not allowed from the same provider. Hospices
> must not submit an 8XC if the CMS Certification Number (CCN) is the
> same. In this scenario the beneficiary is not transferred to another
> hospice, they are transferred to another location of the same hospice.
>
> A beneficiary can change hospices only once per benefit period (90-day
> or 60-day). When the beneficiary transfers to a different hospice,
> he/she continues in the same benefit period. To transfer hospice
> programs, the individual or representative must file, with the hospice
> from which care has been received and with the newly designated
> hospice, a statement that includes the following information:

(1) The name of the hospice from which the individual has received care
    and the name of the hospice from which he or she plans to receive
    care.

(2) The date the change is to be effective.

> Given that hospices bill for the date of discharge or transfer, for
> claims purposes, the "From" date for the receiving hospice must be the
> same as the "Through" date for the transferring hospice, otherwise
> this would constitute a gap in care and a gap in billing and would not
> be considered a transfer. For example, if a beneficiary designates
> that a transfer is to be effective on January 10^th^, the transferring
> hospice's "Through" date must be January 10^th^ and the receiving
> hospice's "From" date must be January 10^th^ in order to be a
> continuous hospice election without a gap in care or billing. That is,
> the transferring hospice is responsible for the beneficiary up until,
> and including the transfer date.
>
> If the beneficiary is transferring from outside the service area and
> the transferring hospice cannot arrange care until the beneficiary
> reaches the new hospice, the hospice may discharge the beneficiary.
> This way, if the beneficiary requires medical treatment
>
> while in the process of transferring, he/she can access it under
> his/her traditional Medicare coverage. This would terminate the
> beneficiary's current benefit period and require the beneficiary to
> re-elect hospice coverage at the new hospice and begin a new benefit
> period.
>
> The hospice transfer will be rejected if the transfer does not occur
> immediately. If the receiving hospice's claim "from date" is not the
> same as the "through date" with \"patient status" indicating a
> transfer (codes 50 or 51), the transfer will be rejected. The edit
> will not apply to a subsequent claim, if a transfer is posted and the
> hospice's claim "from date" is the same as the "transfer date".

### Type of Bill

> Enter the appropriate 3-digit numeric type of bill code, according to
> the following code structure:
>
> 81C - Hospice (Nonhospital-Based) Change of provider 82C - Hospice
> (Hospital-Based) Change of provider
>
> **Statement Covers Period** (From-Through)

### Patient's Sex

> Show an "M" for male or an "F" for female. This item is used in
> conjunction with diagnoses and surgical procedures to identify
> inconsistencies.

### Admission Date

> The hospice enters the admission date, which must be the start date of
> the benefit period in all cases except when a transfer occurs. In
> transfer situations, the receiving hospice should use their own
> admission date. When a new hospice admission occurs after a hospice
>
> revocation or discharge that resulted in termination of the hospice
> benefit, the new admission date cannot be the same as the revocation
> or discharge date of the previous benefit period.
>
> Show the month, day, and year numerically as MM-DD-YY.

### Condition Codes

> Condition codes are not required on an original transfer notice. If
> the hospice is correcting a date of transfer using occurrence code 56,
> the hospice reports condition code D0. If the two codes are not
> reported together, the transfer notice will be returned to the
> hospice.

### Occurrence Codes and Dates

> An occurrence code 27 is not required on a transfer notice, unless the
> date of transfer is also the first day of the next benefit period.
>
> Hospices may submit a transfer notice that corrects a date of transfer
> previously submitted in error. In this case, the hospice reports the
> correct effective date of the transfer in the From Date field and
> reports the original, incorrect effective date using occurrence code
> 56. Medicare systems use the original, incorrect date to find the
> benefit period to be corrected, then replaces that date of transfer
> with the corrected information.

# -- Change of Ownership Notice

### (Rev. 4152, Issued: 10-26-2018, Effective: 01-01-18, Implementation: 04-01-19)

> A change of ownership notice is used when the beneficiary will remain
> with the same hospice, but the person or group running the hospice is
> changing. A change of ownership typically occurs when a Medicare
> provider has been purchased (or leased) by another organization.

### Type of Bill

> Enter the appropriate 3-digit numeric type of bill code, according to
> the following code structure:
>
> 81E - Hospice (Nonhospital-Based) Change of Ownership 82E - Hospice

### Occurrence Codes and Dates

> Hospices may submit a change of ownership notice that corrects the
> effective date of a change previously submitted in error. In this

# Hospice Election Periods and Benefit Periods in Medicare Systems

### (Rev. 4280, Issued: 04-19-2019, Effective: 07-21-19, Implementation: 07-21-19) Election Periods

> An election period as described in CFR § 418.21 is the initial 90-day
> period, subsequent 90-day period; or an unlimited number of subsequent
> 60-day periods. In the Medicare systems the term 'election period' is
> used to describe the overall period between an election and
> revocation, which may include multiple 90-day or 60-day periods.
>
> Medicare systems refer to the 90-day or 60-day periods as 'benefit
> periods.' Therefore, hospices should be aware that when they see
> references to 'election periods' in regulation or in the Medicare
> Benefit Policy Manual, they are referring to what is called a 'benefit
> period' for purposes of claims processing.
>
> Hospice election and revocation date information are stored in a
> separate election period in Medicare systems from benefit period
> information, so the two types of information can be changed
> independently. Both election periods and benefit periods are stored in
> Medicare's Common Working File (CWF) and can be viewed via inquiry
> screens.
>
> When a hospice submits an NOE (TOB 8xA), Medicare systems create an
> election period. The election period file for each beneficiary
> contains the following data elements for each of their election
> periods:

-   Period Number -- a sequential number assigned to each election
    period

-   Elect Date -- the date of election reported in the From date of the
    NOE

-   Receipt Date -- the receipt date of the NOE that created the
    election period

-   Revoc Date --the revocation date reported in the Through date of the
    NOTR or of a discharge claim

-   Revoc Ind -- a revocation indicator assigned when the revocation
    date is recorded

-   Provider -- the CMS Certification Number (CCN) of the hospice that
    submitted the NOE

-   NPI -- the National Provider Identifier of the hospice that
    submitted the NOE.

> When an 8xA is processed, the election date and receipt date will be
> updated on the election period CWF inquiry screen. The revocation date
> remains blank and the revocation indicator is 0.
>
> The NOE receipt date will be retained on the election period
> permanently. If benefit periods are cancelled, this will not remove
> the NOE receipt date from Medicare systems. If the election date is
> changed using the occurrence code 56/condition code D0 process
> described above, the NOE receipt date will not change.
>
> When a hospice submits an NOTR (TOB 8xB), Medicare systems will post a
> revocation date on the election period and change the revocation
> indicator to 1. Similarly, if a revocation date is corrected using the
> 56/D0 process, the correct date will be displayed on the election
> period.
>
> If the hospice files the discharge claim in lieu of the NOTR, the
> claim will also post the revocation date and revocation indicator on
> the election period, in addition to updating the Term Date1 of the
> benefit period to match the revocation date.
>
> A later NOE for the same beneficiary when there is no revocation date
> on the election period will be rejected. Consistent submission of
> revocations, via NOTRs or claims, within 5 days of the revocation date
> as required by regulation, is very important to prevent this.
>
> When a hospice submits a Change of Provider/Transfer Notice (TOB 8xC)
> or a Change of Ownership Notice (TOB 8xE), this will make no changes
> to the election period.

### Benefit Periods

> The hospice benefit period file pre-existed the episode period file
> and retains all the same fields it had historically, but
> election-related fields on those screens will no longer be used.
>
> The hospice benefit period file for each beneficiary contains the
> following data elements for each of the benefit periods they use while

-   Start Date1 -- the start date of the benefit period

-   Term Date1 \-- the end date of the benefit period

-   Prov1 \-- the CCN of the hospice whose claim created the benefit
    period

-   Inter1---a number identifying the Medicare Administrative Contractor
    serving Prov1

-   DOEBA Date -- date of earliest billing activity, the first date
    billed in the period

-   DOLBA Date -- date of latest billing activity, the Through date of
    the last claim processed in the period.

-   Days Used -- the number of days in the period used to date

-   Start Date2 -- the effective dates of a transfer during the period

-   Prov2 \-- the CCN of the hospice from the 8xC transfer notice.

-   Inter2 \-- a number identifying the Medicare Administrative
    Contractor serving Prov1

-   Revocation Ind -- no longer used.

> Benefit period contain two columns of information. One captures
> information on the original billing hospice and any hospice receiving
> a transfer. A second column, labelled "Owner Change" captures
> information about a change of ownership to either of these hospices.
>
> Benefit periods are created by submitting claims. Benefit period
> information supports claims processing functions only, while the
> election period carries only the beneficiary's election status.
>
> If a hospice needs to cancel all the claims in a benefit period,
> Medicare systems will remove the hospice benefit period.
>
> The first claim submitted by the hospice after an election must ensure
> the From and Admission dates match the election period start date.
> This will ensure the first benefit period in the election is created
> correctly and subsequent claims will process.
>
> When a hospice submits a Change of Provider/Transfer Notice (TOB 8xC)
> or a Change of Ownership Notice (TOB 8xE), this will post the Start
> Date2 and Prov2 information on the hospice benefit period.
>
> When a hospice submits a Change of Ownership Notice (TOB 8xE), this
> will post an Owner Change start date on the benefit period.

> four rates are prospective rates; there are no retroactive adjustments

  Inpatient Respite Care                Revenue code 0655

  General Inpatient Care                Revenue code 0656
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

> For claims with date of service on or after January 1, 2016, there are
> two hospice routine home care (RHC) rates. A hospice day billed at the
> RHC level in the first 60 days of a hospice election is paid at the
> high RHC rate. A hospice day billed at the RHC level on day 61 or
> later of the hospice election is paid at the low RHC rate. See section
> 30.2 of this chapter for additional instructions on the high and low
> RHC rates.
>
> For each day that a Medicare beneficiary is under the care of a
> hospice, the hospice is reimbursed an amount applicable to the type
> and intensity of the services furnished to the beneficiary for that
> day. For continuous home care the amount of payment is determined
> based on the number of hours, reported in increments of 15 minutes, of
> continuous care furnished to the beneficiary on that day. For the
> other categories a single rate is applicable for the category for each
> day.
>
> For the day of discharge from an inpatient unit, the appropriate home
> care rate is to be paid unless the patient dies as an inpatient. When
> the patient is discharged deceased, the inpatient rate (general or
> respite) is to be paid for the discharge date.
>
> A description of each level of care follows.
>
> Routine Home Care - The hospice is paid the routine home care rate for
> each day the patient is under the care of the hospice and not
> receiving one of the other categories of hospice care. This rate is
> paid without regard to the volume or intensity of routine home care
> services provided on any given day, and is also paid when the patient
> is receiving outpatient hospital care for a condition unrelated to the
> terminal condition.
>
> Continuous Home Care - The hospice is paid the continuous home care
> rate when continuous home care is provided in the patient's home.
> Continuous home care is not paid during a hospital, skilled nursing
> facility or inpatient hospice facility stay. This rate
>
> is paid only during a period of crisis and only as necessary to
> maintain the terminally ill individual at home. The continuous home
> care rate is divided by 24 hours in order to arrive at an hourly rate.
> A minimum of 8 hours must be provided. Nursing care must be provided
> for more than half of the period of care and must be provided by
> either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse. Parts of an
> hour are identified through the reporting of time for continuous home
> care days in 15 minute increments and these increments are used in
> calculating the payment rate. Only patient care provided during the
> period of crisis is to be reported. Payment is based upon the number
> of 15-minute increments that are billed for 32 or more units. Rounding
> to the next whole hour is no longer applicable. Units should only be
> rounded to the nearest increment. Billing for CHC should not reflect
> nursing shifts and non-direct patient increments (e.g., meal beaks,
> report, education of staff). Continuous home care is not intended to
> be used as respite care.
>
> The hospice provides a minimum of 8 hours of care during a 24-hour
> day, which begins and ends at midnight. This care need not be
> continuous, i.e., 4 hours could be provided in the morning and another
> 4 hours in the evening, but care must reflect the needs of an
> individual in crisis. The care must be predominantly nursing care
> provided by either a registered nurse (RN) or licensed practical nurse
> (LPN). In other words, at least half of the hours of care are provided
> by the RN or LPN. Homemaker or home health aide (also known as a
> hospice aide) services may be provided to supplement the nursing care.
>
> Care by a home health aide and/or homemaker may not be discounted or
> provided "at no charge" in order to qualify for continuous home care.
> The care provided by all members of the interdisciplinary and/or home
> health team must be documented in the medical record regardless if
> that care does or does not compute into continuous home care.
>
> For more detailed information on Continuous Home Care, see Pub.
> 100-02, Chapter 9,
>
> §40.2.1.
>
> Inpatient Respite Care - The hospice is paid at the inpatient respite
> care rate for each day on which the beneficiary is in an approved
> inpatient facility and is receiving respite care. Payment for respite
> care may be made for a maximum of 5 continuous days at a time
> including the date of admission but not counting the date of
> discharge. Payment for the sixth and any subsequent days is to be made
> at the routine home care rate. More than one respite period (of no
> more than 5 days each) is allowable in a single billing period. If the
> beneficiary dies under inpatient respite care, the day of death is
> paid at the inpatient respite care rate. Payment at the respite rate
> is made when respite care is provided at a Medicare or Medicaid
> certified hospital, SNF, hospice facility, or NF.
>
> General Inpatient Care - Payment at the inpatient rate is made when
> general inpatient care is provided at a Medicare certified hospice
> facility, hospital, or skilled nursing facility.

> Example:

-   Patient elected hospice for the first time on 01/10/XX.

-   The patient revoked hospice on 01/30/XX.

-   The patient re-elected hospice on 02/16/XX.

-   The patient discharged deceased from hospice care on 03/28/XX.

# -- Service Intensity Add-on (SIA) Payments

> (Rev. 3502, Issued: 04-28-16, Effective: 01- 01-16, Implementation:
> 10-03-16)
>
> Effective for hospice services with dates of service on and after
> January 1, 2016, a service intensity add-on payment will be made for
> the social worker visits and nursing visits provided by a registered
> nurse (RN), when provided during routine home care in the last seven
> days of life. The SIA payment is in addition to the routine home care
> rate. The SIA payment is provided for visits of a minimum of 15

>
> The SIA payment amount is calculated by multiplying the continuous
> home care (CHC) rate (per 15 minutes) by the number of units for the
> combined visits for the day (payment not to exceed 16 units) and
> adjusted for geographic differences in wages.

  0 - Nonpayment/Zero Claims          Used when no payment from Medicare
                                      is anticipated.

  l **-** Admit Through Discharge     This code is used for a bill
  Claim                               encompassing an entire course of
                                      hospice treatment for which the
                                      provider expects payment from the
                                      payer, i.e., no further bills will
                                      be submitted for this patient.

  2 - Interim -- First Claim          This code is used for the first of
                                      an expected series of payment bills
                                      for a hospice course of treatment.

  3 - Interim **-** Continuing Claim  This code is used when a payment
                                      bill for a hospice course of
                                      treatment has already been
                                      submitted and further bills are

                                      for a hospice course of treatment.
                                      The **"**Through" date of this bill
                                      is the discharge date, transfer
                                      date, or date of death.

  7 **-** Replacement of Prior Claim  This code is used by the provider
                                      when it wants to correct a
                                      previously submitted bill. This is

> Medicare regulations at 42 CFR 418.26 define three reasons for
> discharge from hospice care:

1)  The beneficiary moves out of the hospice's service area or transfers
    > to another hospice,

2)  The hospice determines that the beneficiary is no longer terminally
    > ill or

3)  The hospice determines the beneficiary meets their internal policy
    > regarding discharge for cause.

> Each of these discharge situations requires different coding on
> Medicare claims. Reason 1: A beneficiary may move out of the hospice's
> service area either with, or without, a transfer to another hospice.
> In the case of a discharge when the beneficiary moves out of the
> hospice's service area without a transfer, the hospice uses the NUBC
>
> approved discharge status code that best describes the beneficiary's
> situation and appends condition code 52. The hospice does not report
> occurrence code 42 on their claim. This discharge claim will terminate
> the beneficiary's current hospice benefit period as of the "Through"
> date on the claim. The beneficiary may re-elect the hospice benefit at
> any time as long they remain eligible for the benefit.
>
> In the case of a discharge when the beneficiary moves out of the
> hospice's service area and transfers to another hospice, the hospice
> uses discharge status code 50 or 51, depending on whether the
> beneficiary is transferring to home hospice or hospice in a medical
> facility. The hospice does not report occurrence code 42 on their
> claim. This discharge claim does not terminate the beneficiary's
> current hospice benefit period. The admitting hospice submits a
> transfer Notice of Election (type of bill 8xC) after the transfer has
> occurred and the beneficiary's hospice benefit is not affected.
>
> Reason 2: In the case of a discharge when the hospice determines the
> beneficiary is no longer terminally ill, the hospice uses the NUBC
> approved discharge status code that best describes the beneficiary's
> situation. The hospice does not report occurrence code 42 on their
> claim. This discharge claim will terminate the beneficiary's current
> hospice benefit period as of the \"Through" date on the claim.
>
> Reason 3: In the case of a discharge for cause, the hospice uses the
> NUBC approved discharge status code that best describes the
> beneficiary's situation. The hospice does not report occurrence code
> 42 on their claim. Instead, the hospice reports condition code H2 to
> indicate a discharge for cause. The effect of this discharge claim on
> the beneficiary's current hospice benefit period depends on the
> discharge status.
>
> If the beneficiary is transferred to another hospice (discharge status
> codes 50 or 51) the claim does not terminate the beneficiary's current
> hospice benefit period. The admitting hospice submits a transfer
> Notice of Election (type of bill 8xC) after the transfer has occurred
> and the beneficiary's hospice benefit is not affected. If any other
> appropriate discharge status code is used, this discharge claim will
> terminate the beneficiary's current hospice benefit period as of the
> "Through" date on the claim. The beneficiary may re-
>
> elect the hospice benefit if they are certified as terminally ill and
> eligible for the benefit again in the future and are willing to be
> compliant with care.
>
> If the beneficiary has chosen to revoke their hospice election, the
> provider uses the NUBC approved discharge patient status code and the
> occurrence code 42 indicating the date the beneficiary revoked the
> benefit. The beneficiary may re-elect the hospice benefit if they are
> certified as terminally ill and eligible for the benefit again in the

> beneficiary revokes the election of hospice care, the hospice shall

> completed before the claim is submitted.
>
> If the required face-to-face encounter is not timely, the hospice
> would be unable to recertify the patient as being terminally ill, and

> from the Medicare hospice benefit because he or she is not considered
> terminally ill for Medicare purposes.
>
> When a discharge from the Medicare hospice benefit occurs due to

> The hospice can re-admit the patient to the Medicare hospice benefit
> once the required encounter occurs, provided the patient continues to

                                   5 days each. M2 is used when respite
                                   care is provided more than once during
                                   a benefit period.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

> Respite care is payable only for periods of respite up to 5

>
> When there is more than one respite period in the billing period, the

-   Revenue code 0655 with line item date of service 07/01/XX (for
    respite period July 1 through July 5) and line item units reported
    as 5

-   Revenue code 0651 with line item date of service 07/06/XX (for

> Occurrence Span Codes:

-   M2 0701XX -- 07/05/XX

-   M2 0715XX -- 07/17/XX

> Provider Liability Periods Using Occurrence Span Code 77: Hospices
> must use occurrence span code 77 to identify days of care that are not
> covered by Medicare due to:

-   Untimely physician recertification. This is particularly important
    > when the non- covered days fall at the beginning of a billing
    > period other than the initial certification period.

> Example:
>
> A new benefit period begins on 6/14/20XX
>
> The hospice is required to obtain the recertification (verbal or
> written) by 6/16/20XX.
>
> The hospice obtains the recertification 6/19/20XX.
>
> The hospice reports 6/14 -- 6/18 as non-covered days using occurrence
> span code 77.
>
> The hospice reports the date the certification was actually obtained,
> 6/19/20XX, in occurrence code 27.
>
> Condition code 85 is only reported in this case because the
> certification was untimely.

-   Late-filing of a Notice of Election (NOE). A timely-filed NOE is a
    > NOE that is submitted to the A/B MAC (HHH) and accepted by the A/B
    > MAC (HHH) within 5 calendar days after the hospice admission date.
    > When the hospice files a NOE late, Medicare shall not cover and
    > pay for the days of hospice care from the hospice admission date
    > to the date the NOE is submitted to and accepted by the A/B MAC
    > (HHH). The date the NOE is submitted to and accepted by the A/B
    > MAC (HHH) is an allowable day for payment.

> Example:
>
> Admission date is 10/10/20XX (Fri). Day 1 = Sat. 10/11/20XX
>
> Day 2 = Sun. 10/12/20XX Day 3 = Mon. 10/13/20XX Day 4 = Tues.
> 10/14/20XX
>
> Day 5 = Weds. 10/15/20XX 10/15/20XX is the NOE Due Date.
>
> IF NOE Receipt date is 10/16/20XX, the hospice reports 10/10- 10/15 as
> non- covered days using occurrence span code 77 or Medicare systems
> return the claim to the provider for correction.

### Value Codes and Amounts

> The hospice enters any appropriate NUBC approved code(s) and the

> If hospice services are provided to the beneficiary in more than one
> CBSA area during the billing period, the hospice reports the CBSA that
> applies at the end of the billing period. For routine home care and
> continuous home care (e.g., the beneficiary's residence changes
> between locations in different CBSAs), report the CBSA of the
> beneficiary's residence at the end of the billing period. For general
> inpatient and inpatient respite care (e.g., the beneficiary is served
> in inpatient facilities in different CBSAs), report the CBSA of the
> latest facility that served the beneficiary. If the
>
> beneficiary receives both home and inpatient care during the billing
> period, the latest home CBSA is reported with value code 61 and the
> latest facility CBSA is reported with value code G8.

### Revenue Codes

> The hospice assigns a revenue code for each type of service provided
> and enters the appropriate four-digit numeric revenue code to explain
> each charge.
>
> Hospice claims are required to report separate line items for the
> level of care each time the level of care changes. This includes
> revenue codes 0651, 0655 and 0656. For example, if a patient begins
> the month receiving routine home care followed by a period of general
> inpatient care and then later returns to routine home care all in the
> same month, in addition to the one line reporting the general
> inpatient care days, there should be two separate line items for
> routine home care. Each routine home care line reports a line item
> date of service to indicate the first date that level of care began
> for that consecutive period.

> NOTE: Hospices use revenue code 0657 to identify hospice charges for
> services furnished to patients by physicians, nurse practitioners, or
> physician assistants employed by the hospice; or physicians, nurse
> practitioners or physician assistants receiving compensation from the
> hospice. *Physician services performed by a nurse practitioner require
> the addition of the modifier GV in conjunction with revenue code
> 0657.*
>
> Procedure codes are required in order for the A/B MAC (HHH) to
> determine the reimbursement rate for the physician services.
> Appropriate procedure codes are available from the A/B MAC (HHH). *The
> Medicare contractor will pay the lesser of the actual charge or 85% of
> the fee schedule amount when revenue code 657 is billed with modifier
> GV.*
>
> Additional revenue codes are reported describing the visits provided
> under each level of care.
>
> To constitute a visit, the discipline, (as defined above) must have
> provided care to the beneficiary. Services provided by a social worker
> to the beneficiary's family also constitute a visit. For example,
> documentation in the medical/clinical record, interdisciplinary group
> meetings, obtaining physician orders, rounds in a facility or any
> other activity that is not related to the provision of items or
> services to a beneficiary, do not count towards a visit to be placed
> on the claim. During an initial or comprehensive assessment, it would
> not be best practice to wait until later (after the clinician has left
> the home) to document the findings of an assessment or the
> interventions provided during a patient visit. It is recommended that
> this information be documented as close to the time of the assessment
> or intervention as possible. In addition, the visit must be reasonable
> and necessary for the palliation and management of the terminal
> illness and related conditions as described in the patient's plan of
> care.
>
> If a hospice patient is receiving routine home care while residing in
> a nursing home, the hospice would record visits for all of its
> physicians, nurses, social workers, and home health aides who visit
> the patient to provide care for the palliation and management of the
> terminal illness and related conditions, as described in the patient's
> plan of care. In this example the nursing home is acting as the
> patient's home. Only the patient care provided by the hospice staff
> constitutes a visit.
>
> When making the determination as to whether or not a particular visit
> should be reported, a hospice should consider whether the visit would
> have been reported, and how it would have been reported, if the
> patient were receiving RHC in his or her private home. If a group of
> tasks would normally be performed in a single visit to a patient
> living in his or her private home, then the hospice should count the
> tasks as a single visit for the patient residing in a facility.
> Hospices should not record a visit every time a staff member enters
>
> the patient's room. Hospices should use clinical judgment in counting
> visits and summing time.
>
> Hospices report social worker phone calls and all visits performed by
> hospice staff in 15 minute increments using the following revenue
> codes and associated HCPCS. This includes visits by hospice nurses,
> aides, social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapists,
> and speech-language pathologists
>
> All visits to provide care related to the palliation and management of
> the terminal illness or related conditions *in the home*, whether
> provided by hospice employees or provided under arrangement, must be
> reported *in line-item detail. All services provided by hospice
> employees in all other sites of service, including contract
> facilities, must also be reported in line-item detail with the
> exception of hospice inpatient facilities.*
>
> *All General Inpatient Care and respite care visits related to the
> palliation and management of the terminal illness or related
> conditions provided in hospice-owned facilities must be reported.
> However, these services may be reported as a number of visits in each
> discipline per week, using HCPCS code Q5006.*
>
> Hospices do not report visit data at this time for visits made by
> non-hospice staff providing General Inpatient Care or respite care in
> contract facilities.
>
> Social worker phone calls made to the patient or the patient's family
> should be reported using revenue code 0569, and HCPCS G-code G0155 for
> the length of the call, with each call being a separate line item.
> Only phone calls that are necessary for the palliation and management
> of the terminal illness and related conditions as described in the
> patient's plan of care (such as counseling or speaking with a
> patient's family or arranging for a placement) should be reported.
> Report only social worker phone calls related to providing and or
> coordinating care to the patient and family and documented as such in
> the clinical records.
>
> When recording any visit or social worker phone call time, providers
> should sum the time for each visit or call, rounding to the nearest 15
> minute increment. Providers should not include travel time or
> documentation time in the time recorded for any visit or call.
>
> Additionally, hospices may not include interdisciplinary group time in
> time and visit reporting.
>
> For dates of service before October 1, 2018, Hospice agencies shall
> report injectable and non-injectable prescription drugs for the
> palliation and management of the terminal illness and related
> conditions on their claims. Both injectable and non-injectable
> prescription drugs shall be reported on claims on a line-item basis
> per fill, based on the amount dispensed by the pharmacy.
>
> When a facility (hospital, SNF, NF, or hospice inpatient facility)
> uses a medication management system where each administration of a
> hospice medication is considered a fill for hospice patients receiving
> care, the hospice shall report a monthly total for each
>
> drug (i.e., report a total for the period covered by the claim), along
> with the total dispensed.
>
> Hospices shall report multi-ingredient compound prescription drugs
> (non-injectable) using revenue code 0250. The hospice shall specify
> the same prescription number for each ingredient of a compound drug
> according to the 837i guidelines in loop 2410. In addition, the
> hospice shall provide the NDC for each ingredient in the compound; the
> NDC qualifier represents the quantity of the drug filled (meaning the
> amount dispensed) and shall be reported as the unit measure.
>
> When reporting prescription drugs in a comfort kit/pack, the hospice
> shall report the NDC of each prescription drug within the package, in
> accordance with the procedures for non-injectable prescriptions.
>
> Hospice agencies shall report infusion pumps (a type of DME) on a
> line-item basis for each pump and for each medication fill and refill.
> The hospice claim shall reflect the total charge for the infusion pump
> for the period covered by the claim, whether the hospice is billed for
> it daily, weekly, biweekly, with each medication refill, or in some
> other fashion. The hospice shall include on the claim the infusion
> pump charges on whatever basis is easiest for its billing systems, so
> long as in total, the claim reflects the charges for the pump for the
> time period of that claim.
>
> Effective for dates of service on and after 10/1/2018, hospices are no
> longer required to report drugs using line item detail. Hospices may
> report summary charges for drugs as shown in the table below.

>
> Q5004 shall be used for hospice patients in a skilled nursing facility
> (SNF), or hospice patients in the SNF portion of a dually-certified
> nursing facility. There are 4 situations where this would occur:

1)  If the beneficiary is receiving hospice care in a solely-certified
    > SNF.

2)  If the beneficiary is receiving general inpatient care in the SNF.

3)  If the beneficiary is in a SNF receiving SNF care under the Medicare
    SNF benefit for a condition unrelated to the terminal illness and
    related conditions, and is receiving hospice routine home care; this
    is uncommon.

4)  If the beneficiary is receiving inpatient respite care in a SNF.

> If a beneficiary is in a nursing facility but doesn't meet the
> criteria above for Q5004, the site shall be coded as Q5003, for a long
> term care nursing facility.
>
> General inpatient care provided by hospice staff requires line item
> visit reporting in units of 15 minute increments when provided in the
> following sites of service: Skilled Nursing Facility (Q5004),
> Inpatient Hospital (Q5005), Long Term Care Hospital (Q5007), Inpatient
> Psychiatric Facility (Q5008).
>
> *The total number of visits is to be reported for each discipline per
> week at each location of service for General inpatient care provided
> in an inpatient hospice facility (Q5006). Each visit will represent
> one unit.*
>
> These service location HCPCS codes are not required on revenue code
> lines describing the visits provided under each level of care. These
> lines report the HCPCS codes shown in the table under Revenue Codes.

### Modifiers

> The following modifier is required reporting for claims:
>
> PM -- Post-mortem visits. Hospices shall report visits and length of
> visits (rounded to the nearest 15 minute increment), for nurses,
> aides, social workers, and therapists who are employed by the hospice,
> that occur on the date of death, after the patient has passed away.
> Post mortem visits occurring on a date subsequent to the date of death
> are not to be reported. The reporting of post-mortem visits, on the
> date of death, should occur regardless of the patient's level of care
> or site of service. Date of death is defined as the date of death
> reported on the death certificate. Hospices shall report hospice
> visits that occur before death on a separate line from those which
> occur after death.
>
> For example, assume that a nurse arrives at the home at 9 pm to
> provide routine home care (RHC) to a dying patient, and that the
> patient passes away at 11 pm. The nurse stays with the family until
> 1:30 am. The hospice should report a nursing visit with eight 15-
> minute time units for the visit from 9 pm to 11 pm. On a separate
> line, the hospice should report a nursing visit with a PM modifier
> with four 15-minute time units for the portion of the visit from 11 pm
> to midnight to account for the 1 hour post mortem visit.
>
> If the patient passes away suddenly, and the hospice nurse does not
> arrive until after his death at 11:00 pm, and remains with the family
> until 1:30 am, then the hospice should report a line item nursing
> visit with a PM modifier and four 15-minute increments of time as the
> units to account for the 1 hour post mortem visit from 11:00 pm to
> midnight.
>
> The following modifier may be used to identify requests for an
> exception to the consequences of not filing the NOE timely:
>
> KX - Even if a hospice believes that exceptional circumstances beyond
> its control are the cause of its late-filed NOE, the hospice shall
> file the associated claim with occurrence span code 77 used to
> identify the non-covered, provider liable days. The hospice shall also
> report a KX modifier with the Q HCPCS code reported on the earliest
> dated level of care line on the claim. The KX modifier shall prompt
> the A/B MAC (HHH) to request the documentation supporting the request
> for an exception. Based on that documentation, the A/B MAC (HHH) shall
> determine if a circumstance encountered by a hospice qualifies for an
> exception.
>
> If the request for an exception is approved by the A/B MAC (HHH), the
> A/B MAC (HHH) shall process the claim with the CWF override code and
> remove the submitted provider liable days, which will allow payment
> for the days associated with the late-filed NOE. If the A/B MAC (HHH)
> finds that the documentation does not support allowing an exceptional
> circumstance, the A/B MAC (HHH) shall process the claim as submitted.
>
> The contractor shall use the following remittance advice messages and
> associated codes under this policy. This CARC/RARC combination is
> compliant with CAQH CORE Business Scenario Three
>
> Group Code: CO CARC: 96 RARC: MA54 MSN: N/A
>
> Hospices may appeal the contractor's determination that an exceptional
> circumstance did not apply.
>
> Modifier GV may be used to identify attending physician services
> performed by a doctor of medicine, doctor of osteopathy, nurse
> practitioner or physician assistant.

### Service Date

> The HIPAA standard 837 Institutional claim format requires line item
> dates of service for all outpatient claims. Medicare classifies
> hospice claims as outpatient claims (see Chapter 1, §60.4).
>
> Service date reporting requirements will vary between continuous home
> care lines (revenue code 652) and other revenue code lines.
>
> Revenue code 652 -- report a separately dated line item for each day
> that continuous home care is provided, reporting the number of hours,
> or parts of hours rounded to 15- minute increments, of continuous home
> care that was provided on that date.
>
> Other level of care revenue codes -- report a separate line for each
> level of care provided at each service location type, as described in
> the instructions for HCPCS coding reported above. Hospices report the
> earliest date that each level of care was provided at each service
> location. Attending physician services should be individually dated,
> reporting the date that each HCPCS code billed was delivered.
>
> Service reporting revenue codes -- report dates as described in the
> table above under Revenue Codes.
>
> For service visits that begin in one calendar day and span into the
> next calendar day, report one visit using the date the visit ended as
> the service date.

### Service Units

> The hospice enters the number of units for each type of service. Units
> are measured in days for revenue codes 651, 655, and 656. , Units for
> revenue code 652 are reported in 15-minute increments.
>
> When days are non-covered due to not filing a timely NOE, the hospice
> reports two lines for the affected level of care. For example, if a
> billing period contains 31 days of routine home care and the first 5
> days are non-covered due to not filing a timely NOE:

-   The hospice reports one revenue code 0651 line containing the
    > earliest non- covered date of service, 5 units and all non-covered
    > charges

-   The hospice reports a second revenue code 0651 line containing the
    > first covered date of service, 26 units and all covered charges

> Report units for service reporting lines as a multiplier of the visit
> time defined in the HCPCS description.
>
> When the revenue code or HCPCS code requires 15-minute increment
> reporting, visits of any length are to be reported, rounding the time
> to the nearest 15-minute increment.
>
> For dates of service on and after 10/1/2018, units for summary drug
> charges lines may be reported using '1' to satisfy the required field
> or using a number of drugs provided during the billing period, at the
> option of the hospice. Service unit data will not be used by Medicare
> for payment or data analysis.

### Total Charges

> The hospice enters the total charge for the service described on each
> revenue code line. This information is being collected for purposes of
> research and will not affect the amount of reimbursement.

### Non-Covered Charges

> The hospice enters a charge amount equal to the Total Charges for any
> revenue code line with a Service Date within a non-covered period
> (e.g., an occurrence span code 77 period).

### Payer Name

> The hospice identifies the appropriate payer(s) for the claim.

### National Provider Identifier -- Billing Provider

> The hospice enters its own National Provider Identifier (NPI).

### Principal Diagnosis Code

> The hospice enters diagnosis coding as required by ICD-9-CM /
> ICD-10-CM Coding Guidelines.
>
> CMS accepts only HIPAA approved ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM/ICD-10-PCS
> codes, depending on the date of service. The official ICD-9-CM codes,
> which were updated annually through October 1, 2013, are posted at
> [[http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/codes.html]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/codes.html)
>
> The official annual updates to ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes are
> posted at
> [[http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/index.html]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/index.html).
>
> Use full diagnosis codes including all applicable digits, up to five
> digits for ICD-9-CM and up to seven digits for ICD-10-CM.
>
> The principal diagnosis listed is the diagnosis most contributory to
> the terminal prognosis.

### Non-reportable Principal Diagnosis Codes to be returned to the provider for correction:

-   Hospices may not report ICD-9CM v-codes and ICD-10-CM z-codes as the
    principal diagnosis on hospice claims.

-   Hospices may not report debility, failure to thrive, or dementia
    codes classified as unspecified as principal hospice diagnoses on
    the hospice claim.

-   Hospices may not report diagnosis codes that cannot be used as the
    principal diagnosis according to ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM Coding
    Guidelines or require further compliance with various ICD-9-CM or
    ICD-10-CM coding conventions, such as those that have principal
    diagnosis code sequencing guidelines.

### Other Diagnosis Codes

> The hospice enters diagnosis coding as required by ICD-9-CM and
> ICD-10-CM Coding Guidelines. Hospices will report all diagnoses
> identified in the initial and comprehensive assessments on hospice
> claims, whether related or unrelated to the terminal prognosis of the
> individual effective October 1, 2015. This will also include the
> reporting of any mental health disorders and conditions that would
> affect the plan of care.

### Attending Provider Name and Identifiers

> The hospice enters the National Provider Identifier (NPI) and name of
> the physician currently responsible for certifying the terminal
> illness, and signing the individual's plan of care for medical care
> and treatment.
>
> The hospice shall enter the NPI and name of the attending physician
> designated by the patient as having the most significant role in the
> determination and delivery of the patient's medical care. If there is
> no attending physician listed, then the hospice shall report the
> certifying MD.

### Other Provider Name and Identifiers

> If the attending physician is a nurse practitioner or physician
> assistant, the hospice enters the NPI and name of the nurse
> practitioner or physician assistant.
>
> The hospice enters the NPI and name of the hospice physician
> responsible for certifying that the patient is terminally ill, with a
> life expectancy of 6 months or less if the disease runs its normal
> course. Note: Both the attending physician and other physician fields
> should be completed unless the patient's designated attending
> physician is the same as the physician certifying the terminal
> illness. When the attending physician is also the physician certifying
> the terminal illness, only the attending physician is required to be
> reported.
>
> **NOTE:** for electronic claims, this information is reported in Loop
> ID 2310F -- Referring Provider Name.
>
> Hospices shall report the NPI of any nursing facility, hospital, or
> hospice inpatient facility where the patient is receiving hospice
> services, regardless of the level of care provided when the site of
> service is not the billing hospice. The billing hospice shall obtain
> the NPI for the facility where the patient is receiving care and
> report the facility's name, address and NPI on the 837 Institutional
> claim format in loop 2310 E Service Facility Location. When the
> patient has received care in more than one facility during the billing
> month, the hospice shall report the NPI of the facility where the
> patient was last treated. Failure to report this information for
> claims reporting place of service HCPCS Q5003 (long term care nursing
> facility), Q5004 (skilled nursing facility), Q5005 (inpatient
> hospital), Q5007 (long term care hospital) and Q5008 (inpatient
> psychiatric facility) will result in the claim being returned to the
> provider.

# - Claims From Medicare Advantage Organizations

> (Rev. 2258, Issued: 07- 29-11, Effective: 01-01-12, Implementation:
> 01-03-12)

A.  Covered Services

> While a hospice election is in effect, certain types of claims may be
> submitted by either a hospice provider, or a provider treating an
> illness not related to the terminal condition, to a fee-for-service
> A/B MAC (A), (B), or (HHH) of CMS. These claims are subject to the
> usual Medicare rules of payment, but only for the following services:

1.  Hospice services covered under the Medicare hospice benefit if
    > billed by a Medicare hospice;

2.  Services of the enrollee's attending physician if the physician is
    > not employed by or under contract to the enrollee's hospice;

3.  Services not related to the treatment of the terminal condition
    > while the beneficiary has elected hospice; or

4.  Services furnished after the revocation or expiration of the
    > enrollee's hospice election until the full monthly capitation
    > payments begin again. Monthly capitation payments will begin on
    > the first day of the month after the beneficiary has revoked their
    > hospice election.

# - Hospice Attending Physician Services

### (Rev. 4280, Issued: 04-19-2019, Effective: 07-21-19, Implementation: 07-21-19)

> Under the Medicare hospice benefit, an attending physician is defined
> as a doctor of medicine or osteopathy or a nurse practitioner or
> physician assistant (for professional services related to the terminal
> illness that are furnished on or after December 8, 2003 and January 1,
> 2019, respectively) who is identified by the patient, at the time
> he/she elects hospice coverage, as having the most significant role in
> the determination and delivery of his or her medical care. Payment for
> physicians, nurse practitioners, or physician assistants serving as
> the attending physician, who provide direct patient care services and
> who are hospice employees or working under arrangement with the
> hospice**,** is made in the following manner:

-   Hospices establish a charge and bill the A/B MAC (HHH) for these
    services under Medicare Part A.

-   The A/B MAC (HHH) pays the hospice at the lesser of the actual
    charge or 100 percent of the Medicare physician fee schedule for
    physician services or 85 percent of the fee schedule amount for
    nurse practitioner or physician assistant services. This payment is
    in addition to the daily hospice rates.

-   Payment for attending physician services is counted with the
    payments made at the daily payment rates to determine whether the
    overall hospice cap amount has been exceeded.

-   No payment is made for attending physician services furnished
    voluntarily. However, some attending physicians may seek payment for
    certain services while furnishing other services on a volunteer
    basis. Payment may be made for services not furnished voluntarily if
    the hospice is obligated to pay the attending physician for the
    services. An attending physician must treat Medicare patients on the
    same basis as other patients in the hospice and may not designate
    all services rendered to non-Medicare patients as volunteer and at
    the same time bill the hospice for services rendered to Medicare
    patients.

-   EXAMPLE: Dr. Jones has an agreement with a hospice to serve as its
    medical director on a volunteer basis. Dr. Jones does not furnish
    any direct patient care services on a volunteer basis. A Medicare
    beneficiary enters the hospice and designates Dr. Jones as her
    attending physician. When he furnishes a direct service to the
    beneficiary, he bills the hospice for this service and the hospice
    in turn bills the A/B MAC (HHH) and is paid for the service. Dr.
    Jones may not bill Medicare Part B as an independent attending
    physician because as a volunteer he is deemed to be a hospice
    employee.

-   No payment is made for nurse practitioner services that can be
    performed by a registered nurse, nor is payment made for nurse
    practitioner services that are performed outside of the attending
    physician role.

    1.  # - Independent Attending Physician Services

### (Rev. 4280, Issued: 04-19-2019, Effective: 07-21-19, Implementation: 07-21-19)

> When hospice coverage is elected, the beneficiary waives all rights to
> Medicare Part B payments for professional services that are related to
> the treatment and management of his/her terminal illness during any
> period his/her hospice benefit election is in force, except for
> professional services of an independent attending physician, who is
> not an employee of the designated hospice nor receives compensation
> from the hospice for those services. For purposes of administering the
> hospice benefit provisions, an **"**attending physician" means an
> individual who:

-   Is a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, or

-   A nurse practitioner (for professional services related to the
    terminal illness and related conditions that are furnished on or
    after December 8, 2003), or

-   A physician assistant (for professional services related to the
    > terminal illness and related conditions that are furnished on or
    > after and January 1, 2019; and

-   Is identified by the individual, at the time he/she elects hospice
    > coverage, as having the most significant role in the determination
    > and delivery of their medical care.

> Hospices should reiterate with patients that they must not see
> independent physicians for care related to their terminal illness
> other than their independent attending physician unless the hospice
> arranges it.
>
> Even though a beneficiary elects hospice coverage, he/she may
> designate and use an independent attending physician, who is not
> employed by nor receives compensation from the hospice for
> professional services furnished, in addition to the services of
> hospice-employed physicians. The professional services of an
> independent attending physician that are reasonable and necessary for
> the treatment and management of a hospice patient's terminal illness
> are not considered Medicare Part A hospice services. Where the service
> is related to the hospice patient's terminal illness, but was
> furnished by someone other than the designated "attending physician"
> \[or a physician substituting for the attending physician\] the
> physician or other provider must look to the hospice for payment.
>
> Professional services related to the hospice patient's terminal
> condition that were furnished by an independent attending physician
> are billed to the A/B MAC (B) through Medicare Part B. When the
> independent attending physician furnishes a service related to the
> patient's terminal illness and related conditions that includes both a
> professional and technical component (e.g., x-rays), he/she bills the
> professional component of such services to the A/B MAC (B) on a
> professional claim and looks to the hospice for payment for the
> technical component. Likewise, the independent attending physician
> would look to the hospice for payment for services furnished that have
> no professional component (e.g., clinical lab tests). The remainder of
> this section explains this in greater detail.
>
> When a Medicare beneficiary elects hospice coverage he/she may
> designate an attending physician, not employed by the hospice, in
> addition to receiving care from hospice- employed physicians. The
> professional services of a non-hospice affiliated attending physician
> for the treatment and management of a hospice patient's terminal
> illness and related conditions are not considered Medicare Part A
> "hospice services." These independent attending physician services are
> billed through Medicare Part B to the A/B MAC (B), provided they were
> not furnished under a payment arrangement with the hospice. The
> independent attending physician codes services with the GV modifier
> "Attending physician not employed or paid under agreement by the
> patient's hospice provider" when billing his/her professional services
> furnished for the treatment and management of a hospice patient's
> terminal condition. The A/B MAC (B) makes payment to the independent
> attending physician based on the payment and deductible rules
> applicable to each covered service.
>
> Payments for the services of an independent attending physician are
> not counted in determining whether the hospice cap amount has been
> exceeded because Part B services provided by an independent attending
> physician are not part of the hospice's care.
>
> Services provided by an independent attending physician must be
> coordinated with any direct care services provided by hospice
> physicians.
>
> Only the direct professional services of an independent attending
> physician, to a patient may be billed; the costs for services such as
> lab or x-rays are not to be included in the bill.
>
> If another physician covers for a hospice patient's designated
> attending physician, the services of the substitute physician are
> billed by the designated attending physician under either the
> reciprocal billing or fee-for-time compensation arrangement (formerly
> referred to as Locum Tenens Arrangements) instructions. In such
> instances, the attending physician bills using the GV modifier in
> conjunction with either the Q5 or Q6 modifier.
>
> When services related to a hospice patient's terminal condition are
> furnished under a payment arrangement with the hospice by the
> designated attending physician, the attending physician must look to
> the hospice for payment. In this situation the physicians' services
> are Part A hospice services and are billed by the hospice to its A/B
> MAC (HHH).
>
> The CWF response contains the periods of hospice entitlement. This
> information is a permanent part of the notice and is furnished on all

# - Care Plan Oversight

### (Rev. 4280, Issued: 04-19-2019, Effective: 07-21-19, Implementation: 07-21-19)

> Care plan oversight (CPO) exists where there is physician supervision
> of patients under care of hospices that require complex and
> multidisciplinary care modalities involving regular physician
> development and/or revision of care plans. Implicit in the concept of
> CPO is the expectation that the physician has coordinated an aspect of

> reply shows a hospice election. The A/B MAC (B) shall use the hospice
> enrollment trailer information on the CWF reply to examine and
> validate the claim information.
>
> For beneficiaries enrolled in hospice, A/B MACs (B) shall deny any
> services on professional claim that are submitted without either the
> GV or GW modifier. A/B MACs
>
> \(A\) and (B) or DME MACs, shall deny claims for all other services
> related to the patient's terminal condition furnished by individuals
> or entities other than the designated attending physician. Such claims
> include bills for any DME, supplies or independently practicing
> speech-language pathologists or physical therapists that are related
> to the terminal condition. These services are included in the hospice
> rate and paid through the institutional claim.
>
> DME MACs shall make determinations of relatedness in the same way the
> A/B MACs Part B do today -- based entirely on the presence of the GW
> modifier and not based on diagnosis coding. In the event that the
> claim exceeds the number of allowable modifiers, the DME MAC shall
> instruct the supplier to use modifier 99 on the line to indicate

>
> EXAMPLE 1
>
> A dually eligible Medicare/Medicaid beneficiary enrolled in the
> Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) program for

> PACE provider's capitated rate). In this example, the PACE provider
> would maintain a medical record on the patient and the hospice

>
> EXAMPLE 2
>
> A Medicare beneficiary is receiving skilled services from a Medicare

> with a life limiting terminal illness, but chooses to continue
> curative treatments, thereby rendering him ineligible for the Medicare
> hospice benefit. The beneficiary is experiencing a period of
> intractable pain, and the HHA wishes to purchase specialized pain
> control services from the hospice provider. The HHA would then enter
> into a contractual arrangement with a Medicare certified hospice to
> purchase specialized nursing services. The hospice would bill the HHA
> and the HHA would pay the hospice provider directly. Neither provider
> type would be allowed to bill Medicare separately for the contracted
> services (which, in this example, are home health services and
> therefore included in the HHA's episode payment). In this example, the
> HHA would maintain a medical record on the patient, and the hospice
> submits any documentation related to the pain management to the HHA.
>
> EXAMPLE 3
>
> A Medicare beneficiary (non-dual eligible) resides in a skilled

> placement of a feeding tube and has been told, "their loved one may
> not live much longer." The family is struggling with this concept and
> has requested assistance from the SNF regarding hospice care and grief
> counseling. The SNF has provided information about the Medicare
> hospice benefit to the family, but the patient's legal representative
> has made a decision not to elect hospice care at this time. The SNF
> does not have a trained grief counselor or full-time social worker on

# - Coinsurance on Inpatient Respite Care

### (Rev. 4280, Issued: 04-19-2019, Effective: 07-21-19, Implementation: 07-21-19)

> The hospice may charge the beneficiary a coinsurance amount equal to 5

> EXAMPLE
>
> Assume a wage adjusted inpatient respite care rate for the year (as

>
> EXAMPLE
>
> Mr. Brown elected an initial 90-day period of hospice care. Five days
> after the initial period of hospice care ended, Mr. Brown began

>
> Hospices must bill for their Medicare beneficiaries on a monthly
> basis. Monthly billing must conform to a calendar month (i.e. limit
> services to those in the same calendar month if services began
> mid-month) rather than a 30 day period which could span two calendar
> months. Hospices submitting more than one claim in a calendar month
> for the same beneficiary will have claims returned beginning on dates
> of service July 1, 2013. The only exception to this requirement is in
> the case of the beneficiary being discharged or revoking the benefit
> and then later re-electing the benefit during the same month. The
> monthly billing requirement applies even if the patient is discharged,
> revokes, or expires on the first of the next calendar month. For
> example, if a patient is admitted to hospice on August 8^th^ and
> revokes the benefit on September 1st, the hospice must submit two
> claims. A claim is submitted for dates of service August 8 to August
> 31and a separate claim is submitted with dates of service September 1
> to September 1. Hospice claims should not span multiple months. Any
> hospice claim spanning multiple months will be returned to the
> provider for correction.

>
> §1862(a)(1)(C). When a Medicare hospice beneficiary has been receiving

> associated with ABN issuance are provided in this manual in Chapter 1
> General Billing Requirements, section 60.4.1 Outpatient Billing with
> an ABN (Occurrence Code 32).
>
> Hospices should be aware Medicare may require suspension of any claims

> associated with an ABN. A/B MACs (HHH) reviewing GIP reported on a
> hospice claim with an ABN provided may conclude the care is not
> reasonable and medically necessary. When the A/B MAC (HHH) makes the
> non-coverage determination, they must non-cover the GIP line item(s)
> on the claim. Hospices may be paid the routine home care (RHC) rate in
> lieu of the denied GIP service. The A/B MAC (HHH) adds a line item for
> RHC (revenue code 0651) for each denied GIP line. The charges
> associated with the added RHC line should be the RHC charges the

# HOSPICE Pricer Program

> (Rev. 3930; Issued: 12-01-17, Effective: 03-01-18, Implementation:
> 03-01-18)
>
> Hospice services billed on TOB 081x and 082x are reimbursed based on
> calculations made by the Hospice Pricer. The Hospice Pricer is a
> module within Medicare claims processing systems. The Hospice Pricer
> makes all payment calculations applicable under Hospice claims,
> including all levels of care (Routine Home Care, Continuous Home Care,
> Inpatient Respite Care, and General Inpatient Care).
>
> Medicare claims processing systems must send an input record to Pricer
> for all claims with covered visits, and Pricer will return an output
> record to the shared systems. The following section describes the
> elements of Hospice claims that are used in the Hospice Pricer and the
> logic that is used to make payment determinations. The following is
> presented for A/B MACs (HHH) in order to help understand their Hospice
> payments and how they are determined.

# Decision Logic Used by the Pricer on Claims

### (Rev. 4393, Issued: 09- 13-19: Effective: 11-25-19, Implementation: 11-25-19)

> The following components are used by the Hospice Pricer to determine
> the Hospice payment rate:

-   Wage Index

-   Labor and Non-Labor Amounts for each level of care rate

    -   Routine Home Care (RHC) rates days 1 thru 60

    -   Routine Home Care (RHC) rates days 60+

    -   Continuous Home Care (CHC) rates

    -   Inpatient Respite Care (IRC) rates

    -   General Inpatient Care (GIP) rates

-   Service Intensity Add-on (SIA) rates

> These components are updated in the Hospice Pricer annually. Whenever
> the Hospice Pricer is updated, Medicare also publishes a Recurring
> Update Notification to inform providers and A/B MACs (HHH) about the
> changes.
>
> On each input record, Pricer performs the following calculations:

1.  Determine the payment rate for the RHC level of care REV1 by
    > multiplying the labor portion of the RHC payment rate by the
    > associated BENE CBSA wage index and sum with the non-labor
    > portion. The labor portion plus the non-labor portion, multiplied
    > by the number of RHC days determines the payment amount.

> There are high/low RHC labor and non-labor share rates. The RHC low
> rate is applied to all RHC days for service beyond the 60th day
> (calculated by looking at the span between the ADMISSION DATE field
> and the LINE ITEM DOS1 date field plus NA DAY 1 ADD-ON UNITS). The RHC
> high rates are applied to service on the 60th day or earlier.
>
> If EOL Day 1 Add-on Units are present then SIA payment will be made.
> The payment will be equal to the CHC hourly rate, multiplied by the
> hours of nursing or social worker services provided (up to four hours
> total) that occurred on the day of service or a total of 16 units per
> day for the final seven days of life.

2.  Determine the payment rate for the CHC level of care REV2 by
    > multiplying the labor portion of the CHC payment rate by the
    > associated BENE CBSA wage index and sum with the non-labor
    > portion. The labor portion plus the non-labor portion, multiplied
    > by the number of CHC hours (UNITS2 divided by 4) determines the
    > payment amount.

3.  Determine the payment rate for the IRC level of care REV3 by
    > multiplying the labor portion of the IRC payment rate by the
    > associated PROV CBSA wage index and sum with the non-labor
    > portion. The labor portion plus the non-labor portion, multiplied
    > by the number of IRC days determines the payment amount.

4.  Determine the payment rate for the GIP level of care REV4 by
    > multiplying the labor portion of the GIP payment rate by the
    > associated PROV CBSA wage index and sum with the non-labor
    > portion. The labor portion plus the non-labor portion, multiplied
    > by the number of GIP days determines the payment amount.

5.  Calculate the total claim payment by adding all the THEIR-PAY-CHRG
    > fields plus the SIA payment amount total. This is informational
    > only. The clams processing systems uses the THEIR-PAY- CHRG fields
    > to make payment.

> Note: Pricer reduce payment by 2% if the hospice does not submit
> quality data. A value of 1 in the QIP REDUCTION IND field indicates
> that the hospice is subject to the 2% payment reduction due to not
> reporting required quality data.
