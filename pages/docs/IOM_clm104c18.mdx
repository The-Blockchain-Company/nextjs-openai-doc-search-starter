# - Waiver of Cost Sharing Requirements of Coinsurance, Copayment and Deductible for Furnished Preventive Services Available in Medicare

## (Rev. 2233, Issued: 05-27-11, Effective: 01-01-11, Implementation: 06-28-11)

> Section 4104(b)(4) of the ACA, amends section 1833(a)(1) of the Act,
> by requiring 100 percent payment for the IPPE, AWV and for those
> preventive services recommended by the United States Preventive
> Services Task Force (USPSTF) with a grade of A or B for any indication
> or population and that are appropriate for the individual.
>
> **[Waiver of Coinsurance and Copayment for Preventive Services and
> Screenings]{.underline}**
>
> This requirement waives any coinsurance or copayment that would
> otherwise be applicable under section 1833(a)(1) of the Act for those
> items and services listed in section 1861(ww)(2) of the Act (excluding
> electrocardiograms) to which the USPSTF has given a grade of A or B.
> In addition, section 4103(c)(1) of the Affordable Care Act waives the
> coinsurance or copayment for the AWV.
>
> The coinsurance or copayment represents the beneficiary's share of the
> payment to the provider or supplier for furnished services.
> Coinsurance generally refers to a percentage (for example, 20 percent)
> of the Medicare payment rate for which the beneficiary is liable and
> is applicable under the PFS, while copayment generally refers to an
> established amount that the beneficiary must pay that is not
> necessarily related to a particular percentage of the Medicare
> payment, and is applicable under the hospital Outpatient Prospective
> Payment System (OPPS).
>
> **[Waiver of Deductible for Preventive Services and
> Screening]{.underline}**
>
> Section 4104(b)of the Affordable Care Act amends section 1833(b)(1) of
> the Act to waive the deductible for preventive services described in
> subparagraph (A) of section 1861(ddd)(3) of the Act that have a grade
> of A or B from the USPSTF. In addition, section 4103(c)(1) of the
> Affordable Care Act waives the deductible for the AWV. These
> provisions are effective for services furnished on and after January
> 1, 2011. Section 101(b)(2) of the MIPPA amended section 1833(b) of the
> Act to waive the deductible for the IPPE effective January 1, 2009.
>
> **NOTE:** Not all preventive services allowed in Medicare and
> recommended by the USPSTF have a Grade of A or B, and therefore, some
> of the preventive services do not meet the criteria in sections
> 1833(a)(1) and (b)(1) of the Act for the waiver of deductible and
> coinsurance. Refer to the Preventive Services Table in section 5.2, of
> this section, for specific USPSTF ratings for preventive services.

## (Rev. 11355; Issued:04-14-22; Effective:05-16-22; Implementation:05-16-22)

> For MACs (Part B), Part B of Medicare pays 100 percent of the Medicare
> allowed amount for pneumococcal, influenza, hepatitis B virus COVID-19
> vaccines and their administration.
>
> Part B deductible and coinsurance do not apply for pneumococcal,
> influenza, hepatitis virus and/or COVID-19 vaccine.
>
> State laws governing who may administer preventive vaccinations and
> the coronavirus vaccines as well as how the vaccines are transported
> vary widely. Medicare contractors should instruct physicians,
> suppliers, and providers to become familiar with state regulations for
> all vaccines in the areas where they will be immunizing.

> regardless of the setting in which they are furnished, even when
> provided to an inpatient during a hospital stay covered under Part A.

> 42 CFR 410.57 authorize Medicare coverage under Part B for
> pneumococcal vaccine and its administration. Medicare does not require

# - Billing Requirements

## (Rev. 11355; Issued:04-14-22; Effective:05-16-22; Implementation:05-16-22)

> **A. Edits Not Applicable to Claims for Pneumococcal, Influenza, or
> COVID-19 Vaccines and Administration**
>
> The Common Working File (CWF) and shared systems bypass all Medicare
> Secondary Payer (MSP) utilization edits in CWF on all claims when the
> only service provided is pneumococcal, influenza, or COVID- 19 vaccine
> and/or their administration. This waiver does not apply when other
> services, (e.g., office visits), are billed on the same claim as
> pneumococcal, influenza virus, or COVID-19 virus vaccinations. If the
> provider knows, or has reason to believe that a particular group
> health plan covers preventive vaccines and their administration, and
> all other MSP requirements for the Medicare beneficiary are met, the
> primary payer must be billed.
>
> First claim development alerts from CWF are not generated for
> pneumococcal, influenza virus or COVID-19 vaccine. However, first
> claim development is performed if other services are submitted along
> with pneumococcal, influenza virus, or COVID-19 vaccines.
>
> See Pub. 100-05, Medicare Secondary Payer Manual, chapters 4 and 5,
> for responsibilities for MSP development where applicable.

## B Institutional Claims

> Chapter 25 of this manual provides general billing instructions that
> must be followed for institutional claims.
>
> The following "providers of services" may administer and submit
> institutional claims to the A/B MACs (A) for these vaccines:
>
> Hospitals;
>
> Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs); Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs);
> Home Health Agencies (HHAs); Hospices;
>
> Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (CORFs); and
>
> Indian Health Service (IHS)/Tribally owned and/or operated hospitals
> and hospital-based facilities. Other billing entities that may submit
> institutional claims are:
>
> Independent Renal Dialysis Facilities (RDFs).
>
> All providers submit institutional claims for hepatitis B. Providers
> other than independent RHCs and freestanding FQHCs submit
> institutional claims for influenza virus, COVID-19 vaccines and
> pneumococcal vaccinations. (See §10.2.2.2 of this chapter for special
> instructions for independent RHCs and freestanding FQHCs.)
>
> Institutional providers, other than independent RHCs and freestanding
> FQHCs, should bill for the vaccines and their administration on the
> same bill. Separate bills for vaccines and their administration are
> not required. The only exceptions to this rule occur when the vaccine
> is administered during the course of an otherwise covered home health
> visit since the vaccine or its administration is not included in the
> visit charge. (See
>
> §10.2.3 of this chapter).

## C Professional Claims

> Billing for Additional Services
>
> If a physician sees a beneficiary for the sole purpose of
> administering a Medicare covered preventive vaccine, they may not
> routinely bill for an office visit. However, if the beneficiary
> actually receives other services constituting an "office visit" level
> of service, the physician may bill for a visit in addition to the
> vaccines and
>
> their administration, and Medicare will pay for the visit in addition
> to the vaccines and their administration if it is reasonable and
> medically necessary.
>
> Nonparticipating Physicians and Suppliers
>
> Nonparticipating physicians and suppliers (including local health
> facilities) that do not accept assignment may collect payment from the
> beneficiary for the administration of the vaccines, but must submit an
> unassigned claim on the beneficiary's behalf. Effective for claims
> with dates of service on or after February 1, 2001, per
>
> §114 of the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000, all drugs
> and biologicals must be paid based on mandatory assignment. Therefore,
> regardless of whether the physician and supplier usually accept
> assignment, they must accept assignment for the vaccines, may not
> collect any fee up front, and must submit the claim for the
> beneficiary.
>
> Entities, such as local health facilities, that have never submitted
> Medicare claims must obtain a National Provider Identifier (NPI) for
> Part B billing purposes.
>
> Separate Claims for Vaccines and Their Administration
>
> In situations in which the vaccine and the administration are
> furnished by two different entities, the entities should submit
> separate claims. For example, a supplier (e.g., a pharmacist) may bill
> separately for the vaccine, using the Healthcare Common Procedure
> Coding System (HCPCS) code for the vaccine, and the physician or
> supplier (e.g., a drugstore) who actually administers the vaccine may
> bill separately for the administration, using the HCPCS code for the
> administration. This procedure results in contractors receiving two
> claims, one for the vaccine and one for its administration.
>
> For example, when billing for influenza virus vaccine administration
> only, billers should list only HCPCS code G0008 in block 24D of the
> Form CMS-1500. When billing for the influenza virus vaccine only,
> billers should list only HCPCS code 90658 in block 24D of the Form
> CMS-1500. The same applies for the other Medicare covered preventive
> vaccinations.
>
> In situations such as a public health emergency when vaccines are
> supplied at no charge to providers, entities shall submit claims for
> the administration of the vaccine only. For example, a provider or
> supplier may only submit a claim for the HCPCS code for the
> administration of the vaccine. If the billing systems providers and
> suppliers use will not allow submission of only the vaccine or only
> the administration, \$.01 should be submitted as the charge for the
> service that was not provided.
>
> The contractor shall deny claims for vaccine reimbursement costs when
> the vaccine has been provided at no charge to providers and suppliers.

# - Special Instructions for Independent and Provider-Based Rural Health Clinics/Federally Qualified Health Center (RHCs/FQHCs)

> **Clinics/Federally Qualified Health Center (RHCs/FQHCs)**

### (*Rev. 12070; Issued: 06-07-23; Effective: 07-10-23; Implementation: 07-10-23*)

> *Influenza virus, pneumococcal and COVID-19 vaccines do not count as
> RHC/FQHC visits. The cost for these vaccines is included in the cost
> report and a visit is not billed for these services. RHCs do not
> report vaccines on the claim, TOB 71x. However, for FQHCs, if there
> was another reason for the visit, the vaccine and the administration
> code should be reported on the claim, TOB 77x, for informational and
> data collection purposes only. Coinsurance and deductible do not apply
> to these vaccines.*
>
> Payment for the hepatitis B vaccine is included in the RHC
> all-inclusive and FQHC PPS rate. RHCs/FQHCs do not bill for a visit
> when the only service involved is the administration of the hepatitis
> B vaccine.
>
> However, the charges of the vaccine and its administration can be
> included in the line item for the otherwise qualifying *visit*. A
> *visit* cannot be billed if vaccine administration is the only service
> the RHC/FQHC provides.

# - Institutional Claims Submitted by Home Health Agencies and Hospices

## (Rev. 11355; Issued:04-14-22; Effective:05-16-22; Implementation:05-16-22)

> The following provides billing instructions for Home Health Agencies
> (HHAs) in various situations:
>
> Where the sole purpose for an HHA visit is to administer a vaccine
> (influenza virus, pneumococcal, hepatitis B or COVID-19), Medicare
> will not pay for a skilled nursing visit by an HHA nurse under the HHA
> benefit. However, the vaccine and its administration are covered under
> the vaccine benefit. The administration should include charges only
> for the supplies being used and the cost of the injection. Medicare
> does not allow HHAs to charge for travel time or other expenses (e.g.,
> gasoline). In this situation, the HHA bills under bill type 034x and
> reports revenue code 0636 along with the appropriate HCPCS code for
> the vaccine and revenue code 0771 along with the appropriate HCPCS
> code for the administration.
>
> **NOTE:** A separate bill is not allowed for the visit
>
> If a vaccine (influenza virus, pneumococcal, hepatitis B, or COVID-19)
> is administered during the course of an otherwise covered home health
> visit (e.g., to perform wound care), the visit would be covered as
> normal but the HHA must not include the vaccine or its administration
> in their visit charge. In this case, the HHA is entitled to payment
> for the vaccine and its administration under the vaccine benefit. In
> this situation, the HHA bills under bill type 034x and reports revenue
> code 0636 along with the appropriate HCPCS code for the vaccine and
> revenue code 0771 along with the appropriate HCPCS code for the
> administration.
>
> **NOTE:** A separate bill is required for the visit
>
> Where a beneficiary does **not** meet the eligibility criteria for
> home health coverage, a home health nurse may be paid for the vaccine
> (influenza virus, pneumococcal, hepatitis B or COVID-19) and its
> administration. No skilled nursing visit charge is billable.
> Administration of the services should include charges only for the
> supplies being used and the cost of the injection. Medicare does not
> pay for travel time or other expenses (e.g., gasoline). In this
> situation, the HHA bills under bill type 034x and reports revenue code
> 0636 along with the appropriate HCPCS code for the vaccine and revenue
> code 0771 along with the appropriate HCPCS code for the
> administration.
>
> If a beneficiary meets the eligibility criteria for coverage, but his
> or her spouse does not, and the spouse wants an injection the same
> time as a nursing visit, HHAs bill in accordance with the last bullet
> point above.
>
> The following provides billing instructions for hospices:
>
> Hospices can provide the influenza virus, pneumococcal, hepatitis B
> and COVID-19 vaccines to those beneficiaries who request them,
> including those who have elected the hospice benefit. These services
> may be covered when furnished by the hospice.
>
> For dates of service before October 1, 2016, services for vaccines and
> their administration provided by a hospice should be billed on a
> professional claim to the local MAC. Payment is made using the same
> methodology as if they were a supplier. Hospices that do not have a
> supplier number should contact their MAC to obtain one in order to
> bill for these benefits.
>
> For dates of service on or after October 1, 2016, services for
> vaccines and their administration provided by a hospice may be billed
> on an institutional claim.

# - Payment Procedures for Renal Dialysis Facilities (RDF)

## (Rev. 11355; Issued:04-14-22; Effective:05-16-22; Implementation:05-16-22)

> MACs processing institutional claims pay for pneumococcal, influenza
> virus, hepatitis B and COVID-19 vaccines for freestanding RDFs based
> on the lower of the actual charge or 95 percent of the average
> wholesale price and based on reasonable cost for provider- based RDFs.
> Deductible and coinsurance do not apply for pneumococcal, influenza
> virus, hepatitis B and COVID-19 vaccines. MACs must contact their
> professional claims processing staff to obtain information in order to
> make payment for the administration of these vaccines.

# - Hepatitis B Vaccine Furnished to ESRD Patients

## (Rev. 11355; Issued:04-14-22; Effective:05-16-22; Implementation:05-16-22)

> Hepatitis B vaccine and its administration (including staff time and
> supplies such as syringes) are paid to ESRD facilities in addition to,
> and separately from, the dialysis composite rate payment.
>
> Payment for the hepatitis B vaccine for ESRD patients follows the same
> general principles that are applicable to any injectable drug or
> biological. Hospital-based facilities are paid for their direct and
> indirect costs on a reasonable cost basis, and independent facilities
> are paid the lower of the actual charge or 95 percent of the AWP. The
> allowance for an injectable is based on the cost of the injectable and
> any supplies used for administration, plus a maximum \$2 for the labor
> involved, if the facility's staff administers the vaccine. In
> addition, the MAC (Part A) makes an appropriate allowance for facility
> overhead.
>
> Where the vaccine is administered in a hospital outpatient department
> for home dialysis patients or for patients with chronic renal failure
> (but not yet on dialysis), payment is on a reasonable cost basis.
> Outpatient hospital vaccines for non-dialysis purposes are paid under
> hospital outpatient PPS rules.

4.  []{#_bookmark16 .anchor}- Claims Submitted to MACs (Part B) (Rev.

> 11355; Issued:04-14-22; Effective:05-16-22; Implementation:05-16-22)
>
> Medicare does not require that the influenza virus, pneumococcal or
> COVID-19 vaccine be administered under a physician's order or
> supervision. Medicare still requires that the hepatitis B vaccine be
> administered under a physician's order with supervision. As a
> physician order is still required for claims for hepatitis B
> vaccinations, information on the ordering and/or referring physician
> must be entered on the claim.

## A. Reporting Specialty Code/Place of Service (POS) to CWF Specialty

> MACs (Part B) use specialty code 60 (Public Health or Welfare Agencies
> (Federal, State, and Local)) for Public Health Service Clinics (PHCs).
>
> MACs (Part B) use specialty code 73 (Mass Immunization Roster Billers)
> for specialty code C1 centralized billers and specialty code A5 for
> pharmacies (all other suppliers (drug stores, department stores)).
>
> Entities and individuals other than PHCs and pharmacies use the CMS
> specialty code that best defines their provider type. A list of
> specialty codes can be found in Pub. 100-04, Chapter 26. The CMS
> specialty code 99 (Unknown Physician Specialty) is acceptable where no
> other code fits.

## Place of Service (POS)

> State or local PHCs use POS code 71 (State or Local Public Health
> Clinic). POS 71 is not used for individual offices/entities other than
> PHCs (e.g., a mobile unit that is non-PHC affiliated should use POS
> 99). Preprinted Form CMS-1500s (08-05) used for simplified roster
> billing should show POS 60 (Mass Immunization Center) regardless of
> the site where vaccines are given (e.g., a PHC or physician's office
> that roster claims should use POS 60). Individuals/entities
> administering influenza virus, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccinations
> in a mass immunization setting (including centralized billers),
> regardless of the site where vaccines are given, should use POS 60 for
> roster claims, paper claims, and electronically filed claims.
>
> Normal POS codes should be used in other situations.
>
> Providers use POS 99 (Other Unlisted Facility) if no other POS code
> applies.

## No Legal Obligation to Pay

> Nongovernmental entities that provide immunizations free of charge to
> all patients, regardless of their ability to pay, must provide the
> immunizations free of charge to Medicare beneficiaries and may not
> bill Medicare. (See Pub. 100-02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual,
> chapter 16.) Thus, for example, Medicare may not pay for influenza
> virus vaccinations administered to Medicare beneficiaries if a
> physician provides free vaccinations to all non-Medicare patients or
> where an employer offers free vaccinations to its employees.
>
> Physicians also may not charge Medicare beneficiaries more for a
> vaccine than they would charge non- Medicare patients. (See
> [§1128(b)(6)(A)](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title11/1128.htm)
> of the Act.) When an employer offers free vaccinations to its
> employees, it must also offer the free vaccination to an employee who
> is also a Medicare beneficiary. It does not have to offer free
> vaccinations to its non-Medicare employees.
>
> Nongovernmental entities that do not charge patients who are unable to
> pay or reduce their charges for patients of limited means, yet expect
> to be paid if the patient has health insurance coverage for the
> services provided, may bill Medicare and expect payment.
>
> Governmental entities (such as PHCs) may bill Medicare for
> pneumococcal, hepatitis B, influenza virus, and COVID-19 vaccines
> administered to Medicare beneficiaries when services are rendered free
> of charge to non- Medicare beneficiaries. Government entities may NOT
> bill Medicare for vaccine products during a public health emergency
> when vaccines are provided at no charge to Medicare and non-Medicare
> beneficiaries.

# - Simplified Roster Claims for Mass Immunizers

## (Rev. 11355; Issued:04-14-22; Effective:05-16-22; Implementation:05-16-22)

> The simplified roster billing process was developed to enable Medicare
> beneficiaries to participate in mass pneumococcal and influenza
> vaccination programs offered by PHCs and other individuals and
> entities that give the vaccine to a group of beneficiaries, e.g. at
> PHCs, shopping malls, grocery stores, senior citizen homes, and health
> fairs. Effective December 11, 2020 roster billing is also available
> for billing COVID-19 vaccinations.
>
> Roster billing is not available for hepatitis B vaccinations.
>
> If they agree to accept assignment for these claims, properly licensed
> individuals and entities conducting mass immunization programs may
> submit claims using a simplified claim's filing procedure known as
> roster billing to bill for influenza virus, pneumococcal or COVID-19
> vaccinations for multiple beneficiaries. They may not collect any
> payment from the beneficiary.
>
> Entities that submit claims on roster claims must accept assignment
> and may not collect any "donation" or other cost sharing of any kind
> from Medicare beneficiaries for pneumococcal, influenza virus, or
> COVID-19 vaccinations. However, the entity may bill Medicare for the
> amount, which is not subsidized from its own budget. For example, an
> entity that incurs a cost of \$7.50 per vaccination and pays \$2.50 of
> the cost from its budget may bill Medicare the \$5.00 cost which is
> not paid out of its budget.

## Provider Enrollment Criteria for Mass Immunizers

> Those entities and individuals that desire to provide mass
> immunization services, but may not otherwise be able to qualify as a
> Medicare provider, may be eligible to enroll as a provider type "Mass
> Immunization Roster Biller."
>
> These individuals and entities must enroll by completing the
> Provider/Supplier Enrollment Application, Form CMS-855. Individuals
> and entities that enroll as this provider type may not bill Medicare
> for any services other than pneumococcal, influenza virus, and/or
> COVID-19 vaccines and their administration. In addition,
>
> claims submitted by the provider type "Mass Immunization Roster
> Biller" are always reimbursed at the assigned payment rate.

## Payment Floor for Roster Claims

> Roster claims are considered paper claims and are not paid as quickly
> as electronic media claims (EMC). If available, offer electronic
> billing software free or at-cost to PHCs and other properly licensed
> individuals and entities. MACs (Part B) must ensure that the software
> is as user friendly as possible for the pneumococcal, influenza virus
> and COVID-19 vaccination billing.

> 100-04, Chapter 26,
>
> §10 for more information about the CMS-1500 claim form. Key
> information from the beneficiary roster list and the abbreviated claim
> form is used to process pneumococcal, influenza, and COVID-19
> vaccination claims.
>
> Separate CMS-1500 claim forms, along with separate roster bills, must
> be submitted for influenza virus, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 roster
> billing.
>
> If other services are furnished to a beneficiary along with
> pneumococcal, influenza, or COVID-19 vaccines, individuals and
> entities must submit claims using normal billing procedures, e.g.,
> submission of a separate claim for each beneficiary.
>
> MACs (Part B) must create and count one claim per beneficiary from
> roster bills. They must split claims for each beneficiary if there are
> multiple beneficiaries included in a roster bill. Providers must show
> the unit cost for one service on the claim. The MACs (Part B) must
> replicate the claim for each beneficiary listed on the roster.
>
> MACs (Part B) must provide Palmetto-Railroad Retirement Board (RRB)
> with local pricing files for pneumococcal, influenza, and COVID-19
> vaccines and their administration. If PHCs or other individuals or
> entities inappropriately bill pneumococcal, influenza, or COVID-19
> vaccinations using the roster billing method, MACs (Part B) shall
> return the claim as unprocessable with the appropriate rejection
> message. MACs (Part B) may not deny these claims.
>
> Providers must retain roster bills with beneficiaries\' signatures at
> their permanent location for a time period consistent with Medicare
> regulations.

## Modified Form CMS-1500 for Cover Document

> Entities submitting roster bills to MACs (Part B) must complete the
> following blocks on a single modified Form CMS-1500 claim form, which
> serves as the cover document for the roster for each facility where
> services are furnished. In order for MACs (Part B) to reimburse by
> correct payment locality, a separate Form CMS-1500 must be used for
> each different facility or physical location where services are
> furnished.

## Format of Roster Claims

> Qualifying individuals and entities must attach to the CMS-1500 claim
> form, a roster bill which contains the claims information regarding
> the supplier of the service and individual beneficiaries. While
> qualifying entities must use the modified Form CMS-1500 claim form
> without deviation, MACs (Part B) must work with these entities to
> develop a mutually suitable roster bill that contains the minimum data
> necessary to satisfy claims processing requirements for these claims.
> MACs (Part B) must key information from the beneficiary roster bill
> and abbreviated Form CMS-1500 claim form to process pneumococcal,
> influenza virus, and COVID-19 vaccination claims.
>
> The roster must contain at a minimum the following information:

-   Provider name and number;

-   Date of service;

> **NOTE:** Providers must include the individual date of service for
> each beneficiary\'s vaccination on the roster bill.

-   Control number for MAC (Part B);

-   Patient\'s Medicare beneficiary identifier number;

-   Patient\'s name;

-   Patient\'s address;

-   Date of birth;

-   Patient\'s sex; and

-   Beneficiary\'s signature or stamped \"signature on file".

> **NOTE:** A stamped \"signature on file\" qualifies as an actual
> signature on a roster bill if the provider has a signed authorization
> on file to bill Medicare for services rendered. In this situation, the
> provider is not required to obtain the patient signature on the
> roster, but instead has the option of reporting signature on file in
> lieu of obtaining the patient\'s actual signature.
>
> The pneumococcal roster must contain the following language to be used
> by providers as a precaution to alert beneficiaries prior to
> administering the pneumococcal vaccination.
>
> **WARNING:** Beneficiaries must be asked if they have received a
> pneumococcal vaccination.

-   Rely on patients\' memory to determine prior vaccination status.

> **MACs (Part B) shall use the data on the CMS-1500 claim form cover
> sheet and the roster bill to correct or add missing claims data and
> continue to process the claims for payment.**

# - Centralized Billing for Influenza Virus and Pneumococcal Vaccines to A/B MACs (B)

## (Rev. 11355; Issued:04-14-22; Effective:05-16-22; Implementation:05-16-22)

> The CMS currently authorizes providers to centrally bill for
> influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccination claims. That is to
> say, they bill all of the claims for those vaccinations to one MAC,
> rather than to each of the MACs that service the location where the
> services are rendered.
>
> Centralized billing is an optional program available to providers who
> qualify to enroll with Medicare as the provider type "Mass
> Immunization Roster Biller," as well as to other individuals and
> entities that qualify to enroll as regular Medicare providers.
> Centralized billers must roster bill, must accept assignment, and must
> bill electronically.
>
> The contractor assigned to process the claims for centralized billing
> will be chosen at the discretion of The Centers for Medicare &
> Medicaid Services (CMS) based on such considerations as workload,
> user-friendly software developed by the contractor for billing claims,
> and overall performance. Currently the specialty contractor for
> centralized billing is Novitas (JH).
>
> To qualify for centralized billing, a mass immunizer must be operating
> in at least three payment localities for which there are three
> different MACs processing claims. Individuals and entities providing
> the vaccine and administration must be properly licensed in the State
> in which the vaccinations are given and the MAC will verify this
> through the enrollment process.
>
> As previously stated, centralized billers must send all claims for
> influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccinations to a single MAC for
> payment, regardless of the jurisdiction in which the vaccination was
> administered. (This does not include claims for the Railroad
> Retirement Board, United Mine Workers or Indian Health Services. These

> Payment is made based on the payment locality where the service was

> these claims.
>
> This section applies only to those individuals and entities that

A.  **Information for Providers Interested in Applying for Centralized
    Billing**

> In order to qualify as a centralized biller**,** a provider must be
> operating in at least three payment localities for which there are
> three different MACs processing claims.
>
> Individuals and corporations who wish to enroll as a CMS centralized
> biller must send their request in writing to Novitas, (the current
> specialty contractor) at the address at the end of this section.
>
> Providers must include the following information in their application
> to become a centralized biller.

1.  Providers must indicate that they agree to the following:

    a.  Centralized billers providing the vaccine and administration
        > must be properly licensed in the States in which the
        > vaccinations are given.

    b.  Centralized biller must agree to accept assignment (i.e., they
        > must agree to accept the amount that Medicare pays for the
        > vaccine and the administration). Since there is no coinsurance
        > or deductible for the influenza, pneumococcal and COVID-19
        > vaccinations, accepting assignment means that Medicare
        > beneficiaries cannot be charged for the vaccination, i.e.,
        > beneficiaries may not incur any out-of-pocket expense. For
        > example, a drugstore may not charge a Medicare beneficiary
        > \$10 for an influenza virus vaccination and give the
        > beneficiary a coupon for \$10 to be used in the drugstore.
        > This practice is unacceptable.

    c.  Centralized billers must understand that beginning December 11,
        > 2021 the payment rate for the administration of the COVID-19
        > vaccine is \$40 and \$30 for the other preventive
        > vaccinations. These payment amounts are geographically
        > adjusted by locality. Therefore, the centralized biller must
        > be willing to accept that payments received may vary based on
        > the geographic locality where the service was performed.

    d.  Centralized billers must understand that the payment rates for
        > the vaccines will be determined by the standard method used by
        > Medicare for reimbursement of drugs and biologicals.

    e.  Centralized billers must agree to submit their claims in a CMS
        > approved electronic media claims standard format. Paper claims
        > will not be accepted.

    f.  In addition to the elements required by regular roster billing,
        > centralized billers must complete the service facility
        > location in order for the MAC to be able to pay correctly by
        > geographic locality. Centralized billers should contact the
        > processing contractor for specific information.

    g.  Centralized billers must obtain certain information for each
        > beneficiary including name, Medicare Beneficiary Identifier,
        > date of birth, sex, and signature. Novitas must be contacted
        > prior to the season for exact requirements. The responsibility
        > lies with the centralized biller to submit correct beneficiary
        > Medicare information (including the correct MBI as Novitas
        > will not be able to process incomplete or incorrect claims.

    h.  Centralized billers must obtain an address for each beneficiary
        > so that a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) can be sent to the
        > beneficiary. Beneficiaries are sometimes confused when they
        > receive an MSN from a MAC other than the MAC that normally
        > processes their claims, which results in unnecessary
        > beneficiary inquiries to the MAC. Therefore, centralized
        > billers must notify every beneficiary receiving an influenza,
        > pneumococcal or COVID-19 virus vaccination that the claim will
        > be processed by Novitas. This notification must be in writing,
        > in the form of a brochure or handout, and must be provided to
        > each beneficiary at the time he or she receives the
        > vaccination.

    i.  Centralized billers must retain roster bills with beneficiary
        > signatures at their permanent location for a time period
        > consistent with Medicare regulations. Novitas can provide this
        > information.

    j.  Though centralized billers may already have a National Provider
        > Identifier (NPI) number, for purposes of centralized billing,
        > they must also enroll with Novitas. This can be done by
        > completing the Form CMS-855 (Provider Enrollment Application)
        > that can be obtained from Novitas.

    k.  If the request for centralized billing is approved, for
        > influenza and pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccinations, that
        > approval is ongoing. It is the responsibility of the approved
        > centralized billers to contact Novitas to make updates to
        > their provider enrollment data on file (i.e. clinic locations,
        > name change, and change to ownership are a few examples) **.**
        > Claims submitted without approval will be denied.

    l.  If a centralized biller is applying to provide COVID-19
        > vaccinations only, that approval will be ongoing. It is the
        > responsibility of the approved centralized billers to contact
        > Novitas to make updates to their provider enrollment data on
        > file (i.e. clinic locations, name change, and change to
        > ownership are a few examples). Claims submitted without
        > approval will be denied.

2.  Applicants for centralized billing should also include responses to
    the following:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  A list of the States in which vaccination clinics will be held;

b.  Contact information for a designated contact for the centralized
    > billing program.

> statement will result in the request not being processed. Novitas will
> reach out to the applicant to attempt to complete any missing data.
> Should they be unable to resolve the matter via outreach efforts,

D.  **Electronic Submission of Claims on Roster Bills**

> All centralized billers must agree to submit their claims on roster
> bills in an electronic media claims format. The processing contractor
> must provide instructions on acceptable roster billing formats to the
> approved centralized billers. Paper claims will not be accepted.

## Required Information on Roster Bills for Centralized Billing

> In addition to the roster billing instructions found in
> [§10.3.1](#_bookmark20) of this chapter, centralized billers must
> provide on the claim the ZIP code of where the service was rendered
> (to determine the payment locality for the claim), and the provider of
> service/supplier's billing name, address, ZIP code, and telephone
> number. In addition, the NPI of the billing provider or group must be
> appropriately reported.

## Payment Rates and Mandatory Assignment

> The payment rates for the administration of the vaccinations are based
> on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) for the appropriate
> year. Payment made through the MPFS is based on geographic locality.
> Therefore, payments vary based on the geographic locality where the
> service was performed.
>
> The HCPCS codes G0008 and G0009 for the administration of the vaccines
> are not paid on the MPFS. However, prior to March 1, 2003, they must
> be paid at the same rate as HCPCS code 90782, which is on the MPFS.
> The designated contractor must pay per the correct MPFS file for each
> calendar year based on the date of service of the claim. Beginning
> March 1, 2003, HCPCS codes G0008, G0009, and G0010 are to be
> reimbursed at the same rate as HCPCS code 90471.
>
> Effective for claims with dates of service January 1, 2020 through
> December 31, 2021, the payment rates for G0008, G0009, and G0010,
> rather than being linked to the MPFS payment rate for 90471, they were
> to be paid at the same rate as they had been in 2019.
>
> Beginning January 1, 2022, the national payment rate for HCPCS G0008,
> G0009, and G0010 is \$30. This payment amount is adjusted based on the
> Geographic Practice Cost Indices used in the MPFS. Locality- adjusted
> payment rates for HCPCS G0008, G0009, and G0010 are available of the
> CMS website:
> [[https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Part-B-]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Part-B-Drugs/McrPartBDrugAvgSalesPrice/VaccinesPricing)

>
> Effective for claims with dates of service on or after February 1,
> 2001, §114, of the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000
> mandated that all drugs and biologicals be paid based on mandatory
> assignment.
>
> Therefore, all providers Medicare covered preventive must accept
> assignment for the vaccine. In addition, as a requirement for both
> centralized billing and roster billing, providers must agree to accept
> assignment for the administration of the vaccines as well. This means
> that they must agree to accept the amount that Medicare pays for the
> vaccine and the administration. Also, since there is no coinsurance or
> deductible for the influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccine
> benefits, accepting assignment means that Medicare beneficiaries
> cannot be charged for the vaccination.

## Common Working File Information

> To identify these claims and to enable central office data collection
> on the project, special processing number 39 has been assigned. The
> number should be entered on the HUBC claim record to CWF in the field
> titled Demonstration Number.

## Provider Education Instructions for the Designated Processing Part B MAC

> The designated Part B MAC must fully educate the centralized billers
> on the processes for centralized billing as well as for roster
> billing. General information on influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19
> vaccine coverage and billing instructions is available on the CMS Web
> site for providers.

## Provider Education Instructions for All MACs (Part B)

> By XXXX of every year, all MACs (Part B) must publish in their
> bulletins and put on their Web sites the following notification to
> providers. Questions from interested providers should be forwarded to
> Novitas, the designated processing Part B MAC for the centralized
> billing workload at the address below. MACs (Part B) must enter the
> name of the assigned processing contractor where noted before sending.

## NOTIFICATION TO PROVIDERS

> Centralized billing is a process in which a provider, who provides
> mass immunization services for influenza virus and pneumococcal
> pneumonia virus (PPV) immunizations, can send all claims to a single
> contractor for payment regardless of the geographic locality in which
> the vaccination was administered. (This does not include claims for
> the Railroad Retirement Board, United Mine Workers or Indian Health
> Services. These claims must continue to go to the appropriate
> processing entity.) This process is only available for claims for the
> influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccines and their administration.
> The administration of the vaccinations is reimbursed at the assigned
> rate based on the Medicare physician fee schedule for the appropriate
> locality. The vaccines are reimbursed at the assigned rate using the
> Medicare standard method for reimbursement of drugs and biologicals.
>
> Individuals and entities interested in influenza and pneumococcal
> centralized billing must contact Novitas, to begin centrally billing
> for influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.
>
> Applications to become a mass immunizer centralized biller for the
> COVID-19 vaccine is an ongoing enrollment. Individuals and entities
> can submit a request to become a centralized mass immunizer at any
> time. For more information on enrolling as a COVID-19 mass immunizer

>
> By agreeing to participate in the centralized billing program,
> providers agree to abide by the following criteria.

## CRITERIA FOR CENTRALIZED BILLING

-   To qualify for centralized billing, an individual or entity
    providing mass vaccination services for influenza virus,
    pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccinations must provide these services
    in at least three payment localities for which there are at least
    three different contractors processing claims.

-   Individuals and entities providing the vaccine and administration
    must be properly licensed in the state in which the immunizations
    are given.

-   Centralized billers must agree to accept assignment (i.e., they must
    agree to accept the amount that Medicare pays for the vaccine and
    the administration). Accepting assignment means that Medicare
    beneficiaries cannot be charged for the vaccination, i.e.,
    beneficiaries may not incur any out-of- pocket expense. For example,
    a drugstore may not charge a Medicare beneficiary \$10 for an
    influenza virus vaccination and give the beneficiary a coupon for
    \$10 to be used in the drugstore.

> **NOTE:** The practice of requiring a beneficiary to pay for the
> vaccination upfront and to file their own claim for reimbursement is
> inappropriate. All Medicare providers are required to file claims on
> behalf of the beneficiary per §1848(g)(4)(A) of the Social Security
> Act and centralized billers may not collect any payment.

-   The contractor assigned to process the claims for centralized
    billing is chosen at the discretion of CMS based on such
    considerations as workload, user-friendly software developed by the
    contractor for billing claims, and overall performance. The assigned
    contractor for this year is \[Fill in name of contractor.\]

-   The payment rates for the administration of the vaccinations are
    based on the Medicare physician fee schedule (MPFS) for the
    appropriate year. Payment made through the MPFS is based on
    geographic locality. Therefore, payments received may vary based on
    the geographic locality where the service was performed. Payment is
    made at the assigned rate.

-   The payment rates for the vaccines are determined by the standard
    method used by Medicare for reimbursement of drugs and biologicals.
    Payment is made at the assigned rate.

-   Centralized billers must submit their claims on roster bills in an
    approved electronic format. **Paper claims will not be accepted.**

-   Centralized billers must obtain certain information for each
    beneficiary including name, MBI number, date of birth, sex, and
    signature. \[The designated Part B MAC\] must be contacted prior to

> submitting claims for verification of billing requirements. The
> responsibility lies with the centralized biller to submit correct
> beneficiary Medicare information (including the beneficiary's Medicare
> Health Insurance Claim Number) as the contractor will not be able to
> process incomplete or incorrect claims.

-   Centralized billers must obtain an address for each beneficiary so
    that a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) can be sent to the beneficiary
    by the Part B MAC. Beneficiaries are sometimes confused when they
    receive an MSN from a Part B MAC other than the MAC that normally
    processes their claims which results in unnecessary beneficiary
    inquiries. Therefore, centralized billers must provide every
    beneficiary receiving an influenza virus or pneumococcal vaccination
    with the name of the processing Part B MAC. This notification must
    be in writing, in the form of a brochure or handout, and must be
    provided to each beneficiary at the time he or she receives the
    vaccination.

-   Centralized billers must retain roster bills with beneficiary
    signatures at their permanent location for a time period consistent
    with Medicare regulations. \[[The designated Part B
    MAC]{.underline}\] can provide this information.

-   Though centralized billers may already have a Medicare provider
    number, for purposes of centralized billing, they must also obtain a
    provider number from \[The designated Part B MAC\]. This can be done
    by completing the Form CMS-855 (Provider Enrollment Application),
    which can be obtained from \[[The designated Part B
    MAC\].]{.underline}

> **DO NOT** need to enroll]{.underline} [separately as a COVID-19 Mass

-   If an individual or entity's request for centralized billing of
    influenza, pneumococcal, [and/or]{.underline} [COVID-19]{.underline}
    vaccines is approved, the approval is ongoing. Claims will not be
    processed for any influenza, pneumococcal, or COVID-19 centralized
    biller without approval from the designated Part B MAC.

-   Each year the centralized biller must contact the designated Part B
    MAC to verify understanding of the coverage policy for the
    administration of the pneumococcal vaccine, and for a copy of the
    warning language that is required on the roster bill.

-   The centralized biller is responsible for providing the beneficiary
    with a record of the pneumococcal vaccination.

-   The information in items 1 through 8 below must be included with the
    individual or entity's annual request to participate in centralized
    billing:

    1.  Estimates for the number of beneficiaries who will receive
        > influenza virus vaccinations;

    2.  Estimates for the number of beneficiaries who will receive
        > pneumococcal vaccinations;

    3.  Estimates for the number of beneficiaries who will receive
        > COVID-19 vaccinations (if applicable);

    4.  The approximate dates for when the vaccinations will be given;

    5.  A list of the states in which influenza, pneumococcal, and
        > COVID-19 vaccination clinics will be held;

    6.  The type of services generally provided by the corporation
        > (e.g., ambulance, home health, or visiting nurse);

    7.  Whether the nurses who will administer the influenza, and
        > pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccinations are employees of the
        > corporation or will be hired by the corporation specifically
        > for the purpose of administering influenza, pneumococcal, and
        > COVID-19 vaccinations;

    8.  Names and addresses of all entities operating under the
        > corporation's application (not clinic locations);

    9.  Contact information for designated contact person for
        > centralized billing program.

> to mass immunizers that bill MACs (Part A). The simplified roster
> claims filing procedure has been expanded from availability for

> malls, grocery stores, senior citizen homes, and health fairs. To
> qualify for roster billing, immunizations of at least five
> beneficiaries on the same date are required. (See
> [§10.3.2.2](#hospital-inpatient-roster-billing) for an exception to
> this requirement for inpatient hospitals.)
>
> The simplified roster billing claims filing procedure applies to
> providers other than RHCs and FQHCs that conduct mass immunizations.
> Since independent and provider based RHCs and FQHCs do not submit
> individual Form CMS-1450s for the influenza virus vaccine, they do not
> utilize the simplified billing process. Instead, payment is made for
> the vaccine at the time of cost settlement.
>
> The simplified roster billing process involves use of the provider
> billing form (Form CMS-1450) with preprinted standardized information
> relative to the provider and the benefit. Mass immunizers attach a
> standard roster to a single pre-printed Form CMS-1450 that contains
> the variable claims information regarding the service provider and

> The roster must contain at a minimum the following information:

-   Provider name and NPI;

-   Date of service;

-   Patient name and address;

-   Patient date of birth;

-   Patient sex;

-   Patient Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) number; and

-   Beneficiary signature or stamped \"signature on file.\"

> In addition, for inpatient Part B services (12x and 22X) the following

-   Admission date;

-   Admission type;

-   Admission diagnosis;

-   Admission source code; and

-   Patient status code.

# - Simplified Billing for Influenza, Pneumococcal and COVID-19 Virus Vaccination Services by HHAs

## (Rev. 11355; Issued:04-14-22; Effective:05-16-22; Implementation:05-16-22)

> The following billing instructions apply to HHAs that roster bill for
> influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccines.

-   When an HHA provides the influenza virus vaccine or the pneumococcal
    vaccine in a mass immunization setting, it does not have the option
    to pick and choose whom to bill for this service. If it is using
    employees from the certified portion, and as a result will be
    reflecting these costs on the cost report, it must bill the A/B MAC
    (HHH) on the Form CMS-1450.

-   If the HHA is using employees from the noncertified portion of the
    agency (employees of another entity that are not certified as part
    of the HHA), and as a result, will not be reflecting these costs on
    the cost report, it must obtain a provider number and bill their A/B
    MAC (B) on the Form CMS-1500.

-   If employees from both certified and noncertified portions of the
    HHA furnish the vaccines at a single mass immunization site, they
    must prepare two separate rosters, e.g., one for employees of the
    certified portion to be submitted to the A/B MAC (HHH) and one
    roster for employees of the noncertified portion to be submitted to
    the A/B MAC (B).

# - Hospital Inpatient Roster Billing

## (Rev. 11355; Issued:04-14-22; Effective:05-16-22; Implementation:05-16-22)

> The following billing instructions apply to hospitals that roster bill
> for the influenza, pneumococcal and/or COVID-19 vaccinations provided
> to inpatients:

-   Hospitals do not have to wait until patients are discharged to
    provide the vaccine. They may provide it anytime during the
    patient's stay;

-   The roster should reflect the actual date of service;

-   The requirement to provide the vaccine to five or more patients at
    the same time to meet the requirements for mass immunizers is waived
    when vaccines are provided to hospital inpatients. Therefore, the
    roster may contain fewer than five patients or fewer than five
    patients on the same day; and

    -   The roster should contain information indicating that the
        vaccines were provided to inpatients to avoid questions
        regarding the number of patients or various dates.

# - Electronic Roster Claims

## (Rev. 11355; Issued:04-14-22; Effective:05-16-22; Implementation:05-16-22)

> As for all other Medicare-covered services, MACs (Part A) pay
> electronic claims more quickly than paper claims. For payment floor
> purposes, roster bills are paper bills and may not be paid as quickly
> as EMC. (See Chapter 1.) If available, MACs (Part A) must offer free,
> or at-cost, electronic billing software and ensure that the software
> is as user friendly as possible to roster bill for the influenza,
> pneumococcal and COVID-19 vaccinations.

# - Mammography Services (Screening and Diagnostic)

## (Rev. 1387, Issued: 12-07-07, Effective: 04-01-08, Implementation: 04-07-08)

A.  **Screening Mammography**

> Beginning January 1, 1991, Medicare provides Part B coverage of
> screening mammographies for women. Screening mammographies are
> radiologic procedures for early detection of breast cancer and include
> a physician's interpretation of the results. A doctor's prescription
> or referral is not necessary for the procedure to be covered. Whether
> payment can be made is determined by a woman's age and statutory
> frequency parameter. See Pub. 100-02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual,
> chapter 15, section 280.3 for additional coverage information for a
> screening mammography.
>
> Section 4101 of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 provides for
> annual screening mammographies for women over age 39 and waives the
> Part B deductible. Coverage applies as follows:

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| > **Age    | > **Screening Period**                                  |

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

> **NOTE:** Count months between screening mammographies beginning the
> month after the date of the examination. For example, if Mrs. Smith
> received a screening mammography examination in January 2005, begin
> counting the next month (February 2005) until 11 months have elapsed.
> Payment can be made for another screening mammography in January 2006.

## Diagnostic Mammography

> A diagnostic mammography is a radiological mammogram and is a covered
> diagnostic test under the following conditions:

-   A patient has distinct signs and symptoms for which a mammogram is
    indicated;

-   A patient has a history of breast cancer; or

-   A patient is asymptomatic, but based on the patient's history and
    other factors the physician considers significant, the physician's
    judgment is that a mammogram is appropriate.

-   Beginning January 1, 2005, Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,
    and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, §644, Public Law 108-173 has
    changed the way Medicare pays for diagnostic mammography. Medicare
    will pay based on the MPFS in lieu of OPPS or the lower of the
    actual change.

# - Certification of Mammography Facilities

## (Rev. 1387, Issued: 12-07-07, Effective: 04-01-08, Implementation: 04-07-08)

> The Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) provides specific
> standards regarding those qualified to perform screening and
> diagnostic mammograms and how they should be certified. The MQSA
> requires the Secretary to ensure that all facilities that provide
> mammography services meet national quality standards.
>
> Effective October 1, 1994, all facilities providing screening and
> diagnostic mammography services (except VA facilities) must have a
> certificate issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
> continue to operate. The FDA, Center for Devices and Radiological
> Health, is responsible for collecting certificate fees and surveying
> mammography facilities (screening and diagnostic).
>
> The FDA provides CMS with a listing of all providers that have been
> issued certificates to perform mammography services and CMS notifies
> A/B MACs (A) and (B) accordingly. A/B MACs (A) and (B) are also
> notified of situations where a provider's certificate has expired, or
> has been suspended or revoked. The information provided includes the
> provider's name, address, 6-position certification number,
> effective/expiration dates and the letter "T" to designate the
> facility as terminated.
>
> Medicare will reimburse only FDA-certified mammography centers for
> mammography services. A/B MACs
>
> \(B\) must inform physicians and suppliers at least annually, through
> their provider/supplier publications, of those facilities centers,
> that are certified. A/B MACs (B) encourage physicians to inform their
> patients about centers that are certified.
>
> Mammography facilities that perform screening mammographies are
> **not** to release screening mammography x-rays for interpretation to
> physicians who are not approved under the facility's certification
> number unless the patient has requested a transfer of the mammography
> from one facility to another for a second opinion, or unless the
> patient has moved to another part of the country where the next
> screening mammography will be performed. Interpretations are to be
> performed **only** by physicians who are associated with the certified
> mammography facility. A/B MACs (B) are not required to maintain a list
> of these associations unless there is a specific reason for doing so
> and only on a case-by-case basis.
>
> When adjudicating a screening mammography claim, MACs refer to the
> table of certified facilities provided by the FDA through CMS and
> confirm that the facility listed on the claim is in fact certified to
> perform the service. When the MAC determines that the facility that
> performed the mammography service has not been
>
> issued a certificate by the FDA or the certificate is suspended or
> revoked, the claim will be denied utilizing the denial language in
> [§20.8.1](#msn-messages) of this chapter, related to certified
> facilities.

# - Services Under Arrangements

## (Rev. 1387, Issued: 12-07-07, Effective: 04-01-08, Implementation: 04-07-08)

> When mammography services are obtained for patients under arrangements
> with another facility, the provider arranging the service must ensure
> that the facility performing the services has been issued an MQSA
> certificate by the FDA.

# - FDA Certification Data

## (Rev. 1387, Issued: 12-07-07, Effective: 04-01-08, Implementation: 04-07-08)

> The FDA furnishes data to CMS on a weekly basis, which specify the
> certification of facilities under the MQSA. This data are contained in
> a "MQSA file."
>
> Prior to April 1, 2003, the MQSA file showed all facilities that are
> certified to perform film screening and diagnostic mammograms. After
> April 1, 2003, the file shows a new Record Type with two indicators,
> "1" for film and "2" for digital to determine which mammograms the
> facility is certified to perform.
>
> Section 104 of the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) of
> 2000, entitled "Modernization of Screening Mammography Benefit,"
> provided new payment methodologies for both diagnostic and screening
> mammograms that utilize digital technology. The new digital
> mammography codes have a higher payment rate. In order for Medicare to
> know whether the mammography facility is certified to perform digital
> mammography and, therefore, due a higher payment rate, CMS relies upon
> the FDA certification data contained in the MQSA file. The FDA sends
> an updated file via the CMS Mainframe Telecommunications System
> (CMSTS), formerly Network Data Mover, on a weekly basis.
>
> Effective July 1, 2006, the MQSA file shows:

-   Name of Facility,

-   Certification number of the facility,

-   Film certification obtained (Record-type =1) or digital
    certification obtained (Record-type = 2),

-   Effective and Expiration dates of each certification,

-   Letter "T" to designate the facility as terminated,

> Some mammography facilities are certified to perform both film and
> digital mammography. In this case, the facility's name and FDA
> certification number shows up on this file twice. One line will
> indicate film certification with effective date/expiration date while

## A. Diagnosis for Services On or After Oct 1, 2015

> The BBA of 1997 eliminated payment based on high-risk indicators.
> However, to ensure proper coding, one of the following diagnosis codes
> should be reported on screening mammography claims as appropriate:
>
> **[ICD-10-CM]{.underline}**
>
> Z12.31 - Encounter for screening mammogram for malignant neoplasm of
> breast.
>
> Beginning October 1, 2003, A/B MACs (B) are not permitted to plug the
> code for a screening mammography when the screening mammography claim
> has no diagnosis code. Screening mammography claims with no diagnosis
> code must be returned as unprocessable for assigned claims. For
> unassigned claims, deny the claim.
>
> In general, providers report diagnosis codes in accordance with the
> instructions in the appropriate ASC X12 837 claim technical report 3
> (institutional or professional) and the paper claim form instructions
> found in chapters 25 (institutional) and 26 (professional).
>
> In addition, for institutional claims, providers report diagnosis code
> Z12.31 (if ICD-10-CM is applicable) in "Principal Diagnosis Code" if
> the screening mammography is the only service reported on the claim.
> If the claim contains other services in addition to the screening
> mammography, these diagnostic code Z12.31 (ICD- 10-CM) are reported,
> as appropriate, in "Other Diagnostic Codes." **NOTE:** Information
> regarding the form locator number that corresponds to the principal
> and other diagnosis codes is found in chapter 25.
>
> A/B MACs (B) receive this diagnosis in field 21 and field 24E with the
> appropriate pointer code of Form CMS-1500 or in Loop 2300 of ASC- X12
> 837 professional claim format.

# - Payment

## (Rev. 3844, Issued: 08-18-17, Effective: 01-01-18, Implementation: 01-02-18)

> There is no Part B deductible or coinsurance for screening
> mammographies. The anti-markup payment limitation on physician billing
> for diagnostic tests does not apply to these services. Following are
> three categories of billing for mammography services:

-   Professional component of mammography services (that is the
    physician's interpretation of the results of the examination);

-   Technical component (all other services); or

-   Both professional and technical components (global). However, global
    billing is not permitted for services furnished in provider
    outpatient departments, except for CAHs electing the optional method
    of payment for mammography services furnished on or after January 1,
    2002.

    1.  # - Payment for Screening Mammography Services Provided On and After January 1, 2002

## (Rev. 3844, Issued: 08-18-17, Effective: 01-01-18, Implementation: 01-02-18)

> The payment limitation methodology does not apply to claims with dates
> of service on or after January 1, 2002.

## A/B MAC (A) Claims

> For claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2002, §104 of
> the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) 2000, provides for
> payment of screening mammography under the Medicare physician fee
> schedule (MPFS) when furnished in hospitals, skilled nursing
> facilities (SNFs), and CAHs not electing the optional method of
> payment for outpatient services. However, payment under the physician
> fee schedule is not applicable to hospitals subject to the Outpatient
> Prospective Payment System (OPPS) until April 1, 2002.
>
> The payment for code 77067\* is equal to the lower of:

-   The actual charge or

-   Locality specific technical component payment amount under the MPFS.

> Part B deductible and coinsurance does not apply. This is a final
> payment.
>
> A/B MACs (A) use the benefit-pricing file provided by CMS to pay
> mammography codes.
>
> Payment for the add-on code 76085 is made under the Medicare Physician
> Fee Schedule. Deductible does not apply, however, coinsurance is
> applicable.
>
> **\***For claims with dates of service prior to January 1, 2007,
> providers report CPT code 76092. For claims with dates of service
> January 1, 2007 and later, providers report CPT code 77057.

>
> Professional services are billed to the A/B MAC (B) and paid based on
> the fee schedule by the A/B MAC (B).
>
> For claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2002, §104 of
> the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) 2000, provides for
> payment of screening mammographies under the Medicare physician fee
> schedule (MPFS) in CAHs not electing the optional method of payment
> for outpatient services.

## (Rev. 3844, Issued: 08-18-17, Effective: 01-01-18, Implementation: 01-02-18)

> A/B MACs use the weekly-updated MQSA file to verify that the billing
> facility is certified by the FDA to perform mammography services, and
> has the appropriate certification to perform the type of mammogram
> billed (film and/or digital). (See §20.1.) A/B MACs (A) use the
> provider number submitted on the claim to identify the facility and
> use the MQSA data file to verify the facility's certification(s). A/B
> MAC (A) complete the following activities in processing mammography
> claims:

-   If the provider number on the claim does not correspond with a
    > certified mammography facility on the MQSA file, then A/B MACs (A)
    > deny the claim.

-   When a film mammography HCPCS code is on a claim, the claim is
    > checked for a "1" film indicator.

-   If a film mammography HCPCS code comes in on a claim and the
    > facility is certified for film mammography, the claim is paid if
    > all other relevant Medicare criteria are met.

-   If a film mammography HCPCS code is on a claim and the facility is
    > certified for digital mammography only, the claim is denied.

-   When a digital mammography HCPCS code is on a claim, the claim is
    > checked for "2" digital indicator.

-   If a digital mammography HCPCS code is on a claim and the facility
    > is certified for digital mammography, the claim is paid if all
    > other relevant Medicare criteria are met.

-   If a digital mammography HCPCS code is on a claim and the facility
    > is certified for film mammography only, the claim is denied.

> **NOTE:** The Common Working File (CWF) no longer receives the
> mammography file for editing purposes.
>
> Except as provided in the following sections for RHCs and FQHCs, the
> following procedures apply to billing for screening mammographies:

## Provider-Based RHC & FQHC - Technical Component

> The technical component of a screening or diagnostic mammography is
> outside the scope of the RHC/FQHC benefit. In a provider-based RHC or
> FQHC, the technical component is billed by the base provider to the
> A/B MAC (A) under bill type 12X, 13X, 22X, 23X or 85X as appropriate
> using the base provider's outpatient provider number (not the RHC/FQHC
> provider number). The revenue code for a screening mammography is
> 0403, and the HCPCS code is 77067\*, (G0202)\*). The revenue code for
> a diagnostic mammography is 0401,
>
> and the HCPCS codes are 77065\* (G0206\*), 77066\* (G0204\*). Payment
> is based on the payment method for the base provider.
>
> \*\*G0236 is a deleted code after December 31, 2003. Use 76082\* for
> claims with dates of service January 1, 2004 through December 31,
> 2006, and code 77051 for claims with dates of service January 1, 2007
> and later.
>
> **\*** For claims with dates of service January 1, 2017 through
> December 31, 2017, report CPT codes G0206, G0204, and G0202. For
> claims with dates of service January 1, 2018 and later, report CPT
> codes 77065, 77066, and 77067respectively.

## Independent RHCs and Freestanding FQHCs - Technical Component

> The technical component of a screening or diagnostic mammography is
> outside the scope of the RHC/FQHC benefit. The practitioner that
> renders the technical service bills their A/B MACs (B) using Form
> CMS-1500. Payment is based on the MPFS national non- facility rate.

## Provider-Based RHC & FQHC, Independent RHCs and Freestanding FQHCs - Professional Component

> The professional component of a screening or diagnostic mammography is
> within the scope of the RHC/FQHC benefit and is billed under the RHC
> AIR or the FQHC PPS payment methodology with revenue code 052X. A/B
> MACs (A) should assure payment is not made for revenue code 0403
> (screening mammography) or 0401 (diagnostic mammography). No payment
> is made on the line item reporting revenue code 0403.
>
> For claims with dates of service on or after April 1, 2005, RHCs and
> FQHCs bill the A/B MAC (A) under bill type 71X or 77X for the
> professional component of a diagnostic mammography. No payment is made
> for the professional component of a diagnostic mammography unless
> there is a qualifying visit on the same day. The services should be
> billed with the appropriate revenue code. HCPCS coding is required for

# - A/B MAC (A) Requirements for Nondigital Screening Mammographies

## (Rev. 3844, Issued: 08-18-17, Effective: 01-01-18, Implementation: 01-02-18)

> The A/B MAC (A) will consider the following when determining whether
> payment may be made:

-   Presence of revenue code 0403;

-   Presence of HCPCS code 77067\* (G0206\*);

-   Presence of high risk diagnosis code indicator where appropriate;

-   Date of last screening mammography; and

-   Age of beneficiary.

> The A/B MACs (A) must accept revenue code 0403 for bill types 13X,
> 22X, 23X, 71X, 73X, or 85X.
>
> **\*** For claims with dates of service January 1, 2017 thru December

# - A/B MAC (A) Data for CWF and the Provider Statistical and Reimbursement Report (PS&R)

## (Rev. 3844, Issued: 08-18-17, Effective: 01-01-18, Implementation: 01-02-18)

> The CWF records are annotated with the date of the first (technical)
> screening mammography claim received. The record is updated based on
> the next covered (technical) claim received. A/B MACs (A) and (B)
> assume the claim is the first received for the beneficiary where
> records do not contain a date of last screening and process
> accordingly.
>
> The A/B MACs (A) include revenue code, HCPCS code, units, and covered
> charges in the CWF record fields with the same name. They report the
> payment amount for revenue code 0403 in the CWF field named "Rate" and
> the billed charges in the field named "Charges" of the CWF record. In
> addition, A/B MACs (A) report special override code 1 in the field
> named "Special Action" of the CWF record to avoid application of the
> Part B deductible.
>
> The A/B MACs (A) include in the financial data portion of the PS&R
> record, revenue code, HCPCS code, units, charges, and rate (fee
> schedule amount).
>
> The PS&R system will include screening mammographies on a separate
> report from cost-based payments. See the PS&R guidelines for specific
> information.

# - Billing Requirements - A/B MAC (B) Claims

## (Rev. 3329, Issued: 08-14-15, Effective: 01-01-12, Implementation: 09-14-15)

> A/B MACs (B) use the weekly-updated file to verify that the billing
> facility is certified by the FDA to perform mammography services, and
> has the appropriate certification to perform the type of mammogram
> billed (film and/or digital). A/B MACs (B) match the FDA assigned,
> 6-digit mammography certification number on the claim to the FDA
> mammography certification number appearing on the file for the billing
> facility. A/B MACs
>
> \(B\) complete the following activities in processing mammography
> claims:

-   If the claim does not contain the facility's 6-digit certification
    > number, then A/B MACs (B) return the claim as unprocessable.

-   If the claim contains a 6-digit certification number that is
    > reported in the proper field or segment (as specified in the
    > previous bullet) but such number does not correspond to the number
    > specified in the MQSA file for the facility, then A/B MACs (B)
    > deny the claim.

-   When a film mammography HCPCS code is on a claim, the claim is
    > checked for a "1" film indicator.

-   If a film mammography HCPCS code comes in on a claim and the
    > facility is certified for film mammography, the claim is paid if
    > all other relevant Medicare criteria are met.

-   If a film mammography HCPCS code is on a claim and the facility is
    > certified for digital mammography only, the claim is denied.

-   When a digital mammography HCPCS code is on a claim, the claim is
    > checked for "2" digital indicator.

-   If a digital mammography HCPCS code is on a claim and the facility
    > is certified for digital mammography, the claim is paid if all
    > other relevant Medicare criteria are met.

-   Process the claim to the point of payment based on the information
    > provided on the claim and in A/B MAC (B) claims history.

-   Identify the claim as a screening mammography claim by the CPT-4
    > code and diagnosis code(s) listed on the claim.

-   Assign physician specialty code 45 to facilities that are certified
    > to perform only screening mammography.

-   Ensure that entities that bill globally for screening mammography
    > contain a blank in modifier position #1.

-   Ensure that entities that bill for the technical component use only
    > HCPCS modifier "-TC."

-   Ensure that physicians who bill the professional component
    > separately use HCPCS modifier "-26."

-   Ensure all those who are qualified include the 6-digit FDA-assigned
    > certification number of the screening center on the claim.
    > Providers report this number in item 32 on the paper 1500 claim
    > form. A/B MACs (B) retain this number in their provider files.

-   When a mammography claim contains services subject to the
    > anti-markup payment limitation and the service was acquired from
    > another billing jurisdiction, the provider must submit their own
    > NPI with the name, address, and ZIP code of the performing
    > physician/supplier.

-   Refer to Pub. 100-04, chapter 1, section 10.1.1.1., for claims
    > processing instructions for payment jurisdiction.

-   Beginning October 1, 2003, A/B MACs (B) are no longer permitted to
    > add the diagnosis code for a screening mammography when the
    > screening mammography claim has no diagnosis code. Screening
    > mammography claims with no diagnosis code must be returned as
    > unprocessable for assigned claims. For unassigned claims, deny the
    > claim.

## A/B MAC (B) Provider Education

-   Educate providers that when a screening mammography turns to a
    > diagnostic mammography on the same day for the same beneficiary,
    > add the "-GG" modifier to the diagnostic code and bill both codes
    > on the same claim. Both services are reimbursable by Medicare.

-   Educate providers that they cannot bill an add-on code without also
    billing for the appropriate mammography code. If just the add-on
    code is billed, the service will be denied. Both the add-on code and
    the appropriate mammography code should be on the same claim.

-   Educate providers to submit their own NPI in place of an
    attending/referring physician NPI in cases where screening
    mammography services are self-referred.

## (Rev. 3844, Issued: 08-18-17, Effective: 01-01-18, Implementation: 01-02-18) B3-4601.3.B

> A/B MACs (B) complete the type of service field in the CWF Part B
> claim record with a "B" if the patient is a high risk screening
> mammography patient or a "C" if she is a low risk screening
> mammography patient for services prior to January 1, 1998.

# - Instructions When an Interpretation Results in Additional Films

## (Rev. 3844, Issued: 08-18-17, Effective: 01-01-18, Implementation: 01-02-18)

> A radiologist who interprets a screening mammography is allowed to
> order and interpret additional films based on the results of the
> screening mammogram while a beneficiary is still at the facility for
> the screening exam. When a radiologist's interpretation results in
> additional films, Medicare will pay for both the screening and
> diagnostic mammogram.

## A/B MACs (B) Claims

> For A/B MACs (B) claims, providers submitting a claim for a screening
> mammography and a diagnostic mammography for the same patient on the
> same day, attach modifier "-GG" to the diagnostic mammography. A
> modifier "-GG" is appended to the claim for the diagnostic mammogram
> for tracking and data collection purposes. Medicare will reimburse
> both the screening mammography and the diagnostic mammography.

## A/B MAC (A) Claims

> A/B MACs (A) require the diagnostic claim be prepared reflecting the
> diagnostic revenue code (0401) along with HCPCS code 77065\*(G0206\*),
> 77066\*(G0204\*), or G0279 and modifier "-GG" "Performance and payment
> of a screening mammogram and diagnostic mammogram on the same patient,
> same day." Reporting of this modifier is needed for data collection
> purposes. Regular billing instructions remain in place for a screening
> mammography that does not fit this situation.
>
> Both A/B MACs (A) and (B) systems must accept the GH and GG modifiers
> where appropriate.
>
> **\*** For claims with dates of service prior to January 1, 2017 thru
> December 31, 2017, providers report CPT codes G0206 and G0204. For

# - Mammograms Performed With New Technologies

## (Rev. 3844, Issued: 08-18-17, Effective: 01-01-18, Implementation: 01-02-18)

> Section 104 of the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act 2000,
> (BIPA) entitled Modernization of Screening Mammography Benefit,
> provides for new payment methodologies for both diagnostic and
> screening mammograms that utilize advanced new technologies for the
> period April 1, 2001, to December 31, 2001 (to March 31, 2002 for
> hospitals subject to OPPS). Under this provision, payment for
> technologies that directly take digital images would equal 150 percent
> of the amount that would otherwise be paid for a bilateral diagnostic
> mammography. For technologies that convert standard film images to
> digital form, payment will be derived from the statutory screening
> mammography limit plus an additional payment of \$15.00 for A/B MACs
> (B) claims and \$10.20 for A/B MAC (A) (technical component only)
> claims.
>
> Payment restrictions for digital screening and diagnostic mammography
> apply to those facilities that meet all FDA certifications as provided
> under the Mammography Quality Standards Act. However, CAD codes billed
> in conjunction with digital mammographies or film mammographies are

# - Pap Smears From January 1, 1998, Through June 30 2001

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> **B3-4603.1A.1, B3-4603.1A.2, B3-4603.1A.3, A3-3628.1A**
>
> The following requirements must be met.

1.  The beneficiary has not had a screening Pap smear test during the
    preceding three years (i.e., 35 months have passed following the
    month that the woman had the last covered Pap smear. Use one of the
    following ICD-9-CM codes V76.2, V76.47, or V76.49; **or**

2.  There is evidence (on the basis of her medical history or other
    findings) that she is of childbearing age and has had an examination
    that indicated the presence of cervical or vaginal cancer or other
    abnormalities during any of the preceding 3 years; **and** at least
    11 months have passed following the month that the last covered Pap
    smear was performed; **or**

3.  She is at high risk of developing cervical or vaginal cancer (use
    ICD-9-CM code V15.89, other specified personal history presenting
    hazards to health) **and** at least 11 months have passed following
    the month that the last covered screening Pap smear was performed.
    The high risk factors for cervical and vaginal cancer are:

    a.  Cervical Cancer High Risk Factors:

        -   Early onset of sexual activity (under 16 years of age)

        -   Multiple sexual partners (5 or more in a lifetime)

        -   History of a sexually transmitted disease (including HIV
            > infection)

        -   Fewer than three negative or any Pap smears within the
            > previous 7 years

    b.  Vaginal Cancer High Risk Factors:

        -   DES (diethylstilbestrol)-exposed daughters of women who took
            > DES during pregnancy.

> **NOTE:** The term "woman of childbearing age" means a woman who is
> premenopausal, and has been determined by a physician, or qualified
> practitioner, to be of childbearing age, based on her medical history
> or other findings.
>
> **COUNTING:** To determine the 11-, 23-, and 35-month periods, start
> counts beginning with the month after the month in which a previous
> test/procedure was performed.
>
> **COUNTING EXAMPLE:** A beneficiary identified as being at high risk
> for developing cervical cancer received a screening Pap smear in
> January 2000. Start counts beginning with February 2000. The
> beneficiary is eligible to receive another screening Pap smear in
> January 2001 (the month after 11 full months have passed).

> will be considered a not reasonable and necessary denial. The
> physician indicates on the claim that an ABN has been obtained by
> using the GA modifier.
>
> Effective for claims with dates of service on or after April 1, 1999,
> a covered evaluation and management (E/M) visit and HCPCS Q0091 may be
> reported by the same physician for the same date of service if the E/M
> visit is for a separately identifiable service. In this case, the

## Screening Pap Smears: CWF Editing for HCPCS Q0091

> The CWF will edit for claims containing HCPCS Q0091 effective for
> dates of service on and after July 1, 2005. Previously, the editing

## Applicable Diagnoses for Billing an A/B MAC (B)

> For professional claims, providers report diagnosis codes according to
> the instructions in the ASC X12 837 professional claim technical
> report 3 for electronic claims and chapter 26 of this manual for paper
> claims. Part of this reporting includes pointing (relating) the
> claimed service to a diagnosis code on the claim.
>
> There are a number of appropriate diagnosis codes that can be used in
> billing for screening pelvic examinations that the provider can list
> on the claim to give a true picture of the patient's condition. In
> addition, one of the diagnoses listed in either the high risk or low
> risk tables above (§40.4) must be on the claim to indicate either low
> risk or high risk depending on the patient's condition, and the
> screening pelvic examination service must point to this diagnosis
> code. Providers must make sure that, for screening pelvic exams for a
> high risk beneficiary, a high risk diagnosis code appears on the claim
> and that the screening pelvic examination service points to this
> diagnosis code. If pelvic examination claims do not point to one of
> these specific diagnoses, the claim will reject in the CWF. If these
> pointers are not present on claims submitted to A/B MACs (B), CWF will
> reject the record.

## Periodically, A/B MACs (B) should do provider education on diagnosis coding of screening pelvic examination claims.

B.  **Applicable Diagnoses for Billing an A/B MAC (A)**

> For institutional claims, providers report diagnosis codes according
> to the instructions in the ASC X12 837 institutional claim technical
> report 3 for electronic claims and chapter 25 of this manual for paper
> claims. (Chapter 25 also contains additional general billing
> information for institutional claims.)
>
> Appropriate diagnoses are shown above in this section for low risk and
> high risk beneficiaries.
>
> **Periodically provider education should be done on diagnosis coding
> of screening pelvic exam claims.**

# - Payment Method

## (Rev 440, Issued: 01-21-05, Effective: 07-01-05, Implementation: 07-05-05)

> Pelvic examinations are paid under the MPFS, whether billed to the A/B
> MAC (A) or (B) **except**:

-   Hospital outpatient services are paid under OPPS;

-   See [[§40.5.B]{.underline}](#payment-method-1) of this chapter for
    proper billing by RHC/FQHCs for the professional and technical
    components of a screening pelvic examination. RHCs/FQHCs are paid
    under the all-inclusive rate for the professional component; or
    based on the provider's payment method for the technical component;

-   CAH payment is under reasonable cost.

> **NOTE:** SNFs are paid under the MPFS and bill the A/B MAC (A).
> Physicians and other individual practitioners bill the A/B MAC (B).

# - Revenue Code and HCPCS Codes for Billing

## (Rev. 3329, Issued: 08-14-15, Effective: 01-01-12, Implementation: 09-14-15)

A.  **Billing to the A/B MAC (B)**

> Code G0101 (cervical or vaginal cancer screening, pelvic and clinical
> breast examination) is used.
>
> Effective for services on or after January 1, 1999, a covered
> evaluation and management (E/M) visit and code G0101 may be reported
> by the same physician for the same date of service if the E/M visit is
> for a separately identifiable service. In this case, the modifier
> "-25" must be reported with the E/M service and the medical records
> must clearly document the E/M service reported. Both procedure codes
> should be shown as separate line items on the claim. These services
> can also be performed separately on separate office visits.

## Billing to the A/B MAC (A)

> The applicable bill types for a screening pelvic examination

> RHC/FQHC service. RHCs and FQHCs bill the A/B MAC (A) under bill type
> 71X or 73X for the professional component along with revenue code
> 052X.
>
> The technical component of a screening pelvic examination is outside
> the scope of the RHC/FQHC benefit. If the technical component of this
> service is furnished within an independent RHC or freestanding FQHC,
> the provider of that technical service bills the A/B MAC (B) on the
> ASC X12 837 professional claim format or hardcopy Form CMS-1500.
>
> If the technical component of a screening pelvic examination is
> furnished within a provider-based RHC/FQHC, the provider of that
> service bills the A/B MAC (A) under bill type 12X, 13X, 22X, 23X, or
> 85X as appropriate using their outpatient provider number (not the
> RHC/FQHC provider number since these services are not covered as
> RHC/FQHC services). The appropriate revenue code is 0770. Effective
> April 1, 2006, type of bill 14X is for non-patient laboratory

    1.  # -- Deductible and Coinsurance

## (Rev. 11865; Issued:02-16-23; Effective: 01-01-23; Implementation:02-27-23)

> There is no deductible and no coinsurance or copayment for the FOBTs
> (HCPCS G0107, G0328), flexible sigmoidoscopies (G0104), colonoscopies
> on individuals at high risk (HCPCS G0105), or colonoscopies on
> individuals not meeting criteria of high risk (HCPCS G0121).
>
> Anesthesia services furnished in conjunction with and in support of a
> screening colonoscopy are reported with CPT code 00812 and coinsurance
> and deductible are waived. When a screening colonoscopy becomes a
> diagnostic colonoscopy, anesthesia services are reported with CPT code
> 00811 and with the -PT modifier; and the deductible is waived. Prior
> to January 1, 2022, when a screening colonoscopy became a diagnostic,
> the beneficiary was liable for the full applicable coinsurance.
> However, Section 122 of Division CC of the Consolidated Appropriations
> Act (CAA) of 2021, Waiving Medicare Coinsurance for Certain Colorectal
> Cancer Screening Tests, amended section 1833(a) of the Act to offer a
> special coinsurance rule for screening flexible sigmoidoscopies and
> screening colonoscopies, regardless of the code that is billed for the
> establishment of a diagnosis as a result of the test, or for the
> removal of tissue or other matter or other procedure, that is
> furnished in connection with, as a result of, and in the same clinical
> encounter as the colorectal cancer screening test. Consequently, the
> applicable coinsurance in these specific scenarios will be gradually
> reduced until it is completely waived for dates of service on or after
> January 1, 2030. Specifically, for dates of service in 2023 through
> 2026, when the PT modifier is appended to at least one code on the
> claim to indicate that a screening colorectal cancer procedure, HCPCS
> G0104, G0105, or G0121, has become a diagnostic or therapeutic
> service, contractors shall continue to waive deductible and shall
> apply a reduced coinsurance of 15 percent for all procedure codes that
> meet the requirements stated above and are performed on that date of
> service and billed on the same claim. For dates of service in 2027
> through 2029, contractors shall continue to waive deductible and shall
> apply a reduced coinsurance of 10 percent for all procedure codes that
> meet the requirements stated above and are performed on that date of
> service and billed on the same claim. For dates of service on or after
> January 1, 2030, contractors shall continue to waive deductible and
> shall waive coinsurance for all procedure codes that meet the
> requirements stated above and are performed on that date of service
> and billed on the same claim.
>
> Coinsurance and deductible are waived for moderate sedation services
> (reported with G0500 or 99153) when furnished in conjunction with and
> in support of a screening colonoscopy service and when reported with
> modifier -33. When a screening colonoscopy becomes a diagnostic
> colonoscopy, moderate sedation services (G0500 or 99153) are reported
> with only the -PT modifier; only the deductible is waived.
>
> Prior to January 1, 2007 deductible and coinsurance apply to other
> colorectal procedures (HCPCS G0106 and G0120). After January 1, 2007,
> the deductible is waived for those tests. Coinsurance applies.
>
> Effective for claims with dates of service on and after October 9,

## A. Colonoscopy Cannot be Completed Because of Extenuating Circumstances

1.  **A/B MACs (A)**

> When a covered colonoscopy is attempted but cannot be completed
> because of extenuating circumstances, Medicare will pay for the
> interrupted colonoscopy as long as the coverage conditions are met for
> the incomplete procedure. However, the frequency standards associated
> with screening colonoscopies will not be applied by the Common Working
> File (CWF). When a covered colonoscopy is next attempted and
> completed, Medicare will pay for that colonoscopy according to its
> payment methodology for this procedure as long as coverage conditions
> are met, and the frequency standards will be applied by CWF. This
> policy is applied to both screening and diagnostic colonoscopies. When
> submitting a facility claim for the interrupted colonoscopy, providers
> are to suffix the colonoscopy.
>
> Use of HCPCS codes with a modifier of -73 or -74 is appropriate to
> indicate that the procedure was interrupted. Payment for covered
> incomplete screening colonoscopies shall be consistent with payment
> methodologies currently in place for complete screening colonoscopies,
> including those contained in 42 CFR 419.44(b). In situations where a
> CAH has elected payment Method II for CAH patients, payment shall be
> consistent with payment methodologies currently in place as outlined
> in chapter 3 of this manual. As such, instruct CAHs that elect Method
> II payment to use modifier -53 to identify an incomplete screening
> colonoscopy (physician professional service(s) billed in revenue code
> 096X, 097X, and/or 098X). Such CAHs will also bill the technical or
> facility component of the interrupted colonoscopy in revenue code 075X
> (or other appropriate revenue code) using the -73 or -74 modifier as
> appropriate.
>
> Note that Medicare would expect the provider to maintain adequate
> information in the patient's medical record in case it is needed by
> the A/B MAC (A) to document the incomplete procedure.

## A/B MACs (B)

> When a covered colonoscopy is attempted but cannot be completed
> because of extenuating circumstances (see chapter 12, section 30.1),
> Medicare will pay for the interrupted colonoscopy at a rate that is
> calculated using one-half the value of the inputs for the codes. The
> MPFS database has specific values for codes 44388-53, 45378-53,
> G0105-53 and G0121-53. When a covered colonoscopy is next attempted
> and completed, Medicare will pay for that colonoscopy according to its
> payment methodology for this procedure as long as coverage conditions
> are met. This policy is applied to both screening and diagnostic
> colonoscopies. When submitting a claim for the interrupted
> colonoscopy, professional providers are to suffix the colonoscopy code
> with a modifier of -53 to indicate that the procedure was interrupted.
> When submitting a claim for the facility fee associated with this
> procedure, ASCs) are to suffix the colonoscopy code with modifier -73
> or -74 as appropriate. Payment for covered screening colonoscopies,
> including that for the associated ASC facility fee when applicable,
> shall be consistent with payment for diagnostic colonoscopies, whether
> the procedure is complete or incomplete.
>
> Note that Medicare would expect the provider to maintain adequate

## HCPCS G0106 -- Colorectal Cancer Screening; Barium Enema; as an Alternative to HCPCS G0104, Screening Sigmoidoscopy

> Screening barium enema examinations may be paid as an alternative to a
> screening sigmoidoscopy (HCPCS G0104). The same frequency parameters
> for screening sigmoidoscopies (see those codes above) apply.
>
> In the case of an individual aged 50 or over, payment may be made for
> a screening barium enema examination (HCPCS G0106) performed after at
> least 47 months have passed following the month in which the last
> screening barium enema or screening flexible sigmoidoscopy was
> performed. For example, the beneficiary received a screening barium
> enema examination as an alternative to a screening flexible
> sigmoidoscopy in January 1999. Start count beginning February 1999.
> The beneficiary is eligible for another screening barium enema in
> January 2003.
>
> The screening barium enema must be ordered in writing after a
> determination that the test is the appropriate screening test.
> Generally, it is expected that this will be a screening double
> contrast enema unless the individual is unable to withstand such an
> exam. This means that in the case of a particular individual, the
> attending physician must determine that the estimated screening
> potential for the barium enema is equal to or greater than the
> screening potential that has been estimated for a screening flexible
> sigmoidoscopy for the same individual. The screening single contrast
> barium enema also requires a written order from the beneficiary's
> attending physician in the same manner as described above for the
> screening double contrast barium enema examination.
>
> Effective for claims with dates of service on or after January 1,

## HCPCS G0120 -- Colorectal Cancer Screening; Barium Enema; as an Alternative to HCPCS G0105, Screening Colonoscopy

> Screening barium enema examinations may be paid as an alternative to a
> screening colonoscopy (HCPCS G0105) examination. The same frequency
> parameters for screening colonoscopies (see those codes above) apply.
>
> In the case of an individual who is at high risk for colorectal
> cancer, payment may be made for a screening barium enema examination
> (HCPCS G0120) performed after at least 23 months have passed following
> the month in which the last screening barium enema or the last
> screening colonoscopy was performed. For example, a beneficiary at
> high risk for developing colorectal cancer received a screening barium
> enema examination (HCPCS G0120) as an alternative to a screening
> colonoscopy (HCPCS G0105) in January 2000. Start counts beginning
> February 2000. The beneficiary is eligible for another screening
> barium enema examination (HCPCS G0120) in January 2002.
>
> The screening barium enema must be ordered in writing after a
> determination that the test is the appropriate screening test.
> Generally, it is expected that this will be a screening double
> contrast enema unless the individual is unable to withstand such an
> exam. This means that in the case of a particular individual, the
> attending physician must determine that the estimated screening
> potential for the barium enema is equal to or greater than the
> screening potential that has been estimated for a screening
> colonoscopy, for the same individual. The screening single contrast
> barium enema also requires a written order from the beneficiary's
> attending physician in the same manner as described above for the
> screening double contrast barium enema examination.
>
> Effective for claims with dates of service on or after January 1,
> 2023, the minimum age for Colorectal Cancer Screening; Barium Enema;

## HCPCS G0121 -- Colorectal Cancer Screening; Colonoscopy on Individual Not Meeting Criteria for High Risk - Applicable On and After July 1, 2001

> Effective for services furnished on or after July 1, 2001, screening
> colonoscopies (HCPCS G0121) performed on individuals not meeting the
> criteria for being at high risk for developing colorectal cancer
> (refer to §60.3 of this chapter) may be paid under the following
> conditions:

-   At a frequency of once every 10 years (i.e., at least 119 months
    have passed following the month in which the last covered HCPCS
    G0121 screening colonoscopy was performed.)

-   If the individual would otherwise qualify to have covered a HCPCS
    G0121 screening colonoscopy based on the above **but** has had a
    covered screening flexible sigmoidoscopy (HCPCS G0104), then he or
    she may have covered a HCPCS G0121 screening colonoscopy only after
    at least 47 months have passed following the month in which the last
    covered HCPCS G0104 flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed.

> **NOTE:** If during the course of the screening colonoscopy, a lesion
> or growth is detected which results in a biopsy or removal of the
> growth, the appropriate diagnostic procedure classified as a
> colonoscopy with biopsy or removal along with modifier -PT should be
> billed and paid rather than HCPCS G0121.

    beneficiary, use:

> 18.29 - This service is not covered for people under 45 years of age.
>
> Spanish Version- "Este servicio no está cubierto para las personas
> menores de 45 años."

B.  If the claim for a screening FOBT, a screening colonoscopy, a
    screening flexible sigmoidoscopy, or a barium enema is being denied
    because the time period between the same test or procedure has not
    passed, use:

    14. \- Service is being denied because it has not been (12, 24,
        48, 120) months since your last (test/procedure) of this kind.

C.  If the claim is being denied for a screening colonoscopy or a barium
    enema because the beneficiary is not at a high risk, use:

    14. \- Medicare covers this procedure only for people considered to
        be at a high risk for colorectal cancer.

D.  If the claim is being denied because payment has already been made

> submitted for HCPCS G0105 within 24 months, the incoming claim should
> be denied.

E.  If the claim is being denied for a non-covered screening procedure
    code such as HCPCS G0122, use:

> the claim as unprocessable to the provider under current procedures.
>
> \***NOTE**: For claims with dates of service prior to January 1, 2007,

> calendar year after the initial year. However, if the beneficiary
> exhausts 10 hours in the initial year then the beneficiary would be
> eligible for follow-up training in the next calendar year. When a
> claim contains a DSMT HCPCS code and the associated units cause the
> total time for any follow-up year to exceed 2 hours, a CWF error will
> set.
>
> See Pub. 100-02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, Covered
> Medical and Other Health Services, section 300 for information on

-   AWV claims when a previous AWV, G0438 or G0439, is paid in history
    within the previous 12 months.

-   Beginning January 1, 2011, AWV claims when a previous IPPE, HCPCS

    advice, including information about personal health harms and
    benefits.

3.  **Agree**: Collaboratively select appropriate treatment goals and
    methods based on the patient's interest in and willingness to change
    the behavior.

4.  **Assist**: Using behavior change techniques (self-help and/or
    counseling), aid the patient in achieving agreed-upon goals by
    acquiring the skills, confidence, and social/environmental supports
    for behavior change, supplemented with adjunctive medical treatments
    when appropriate.

5.  **Arrange**: Schedule follow-up contacts (in person or by telephone)
    to provide ongoing assistance/support and to adjust the treatment
    plan as needed, including referral to more intensive or specialized
    treatment.

    counseling), aid the patient in achieving agreed-upon goals by
    acquiring the skills, confidence, and social/environmental supports
    for behavior change, supplemented with adjunctive medical treatments
    when appropriate.

A.  ## Frequency

    1.  A single, one-time HCV screening test is covered for adults who
        are not considered high risk as defined below, but who were born
        from 1945 through 1965. Those persons born prior to 1945 or
        after 1965 without high risk factors are not eligible for this
        benefit.

    2.  An initial screening for HCV is covered for adults at high risk
        for HCV infection regardless of birth year. "High risk" is
        defined as persons with a current or past history of illicit
        injection drug use and persons who have a history of receiving a
        blood transfusion prior to 1992.

    3.  Repeat HCV screening for a sub-set of high risk persons
        regardless of birth year is covered annually only for persons
        who have had continued illicit injection drug use since the
        prior negative HCV screening test.

> **NOTE:** Annual means a full 11 months must elapse following the

> comprehensive prevention plan. The medical record should be a
> reflection of the service provided.
>
> **NOTE:** See Pub. 100-03, Medicare National Coverage Determinations
> (NCD) Manual, §210.13 for complete coverage guidelines.

> with a very high prevalence of HBV infection (i.e., ≥ 8%),
> HIV-positive persons, men who have sex with men, injection drug users,
> household contacts or sexual partners of persons with HBV infection.
>
> In addition, CMS has determined that repeated screening would be
> appropriate annually only for beneficiaries with continued high risk
> (men who have sex with men, injection drug users, household contacts
> or sexual partners of persons with HBV infection) who do not receive
> hepatitis B vaccination.
>
> A screening test at the first prenatal visit is covered for pregnant
> women and then rescreening at time of delivery for those with new or
> continuing risk factors. In addition, CMS has determined that
> screening during the first prenatal visit would be appropriate for
> each pregnancy, regardless of previous hepatitis B vaccination or
> previous negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test results.
> See section 170 of this chapter for coverage and billing instructions
> for pregnant beneficiaries.
>
> Effective for claims with dates of service on or after September 28,
> 2016, the claims processing instructions for payment of screening for
> hepatitis B virus will apply to the following HCPCS and CPT codes:

-   HBV screening for asymptomatic, non-pregnant adolescents and adults
    at high risk - code G0499

-   HBV screening for pregnant women -- CPT codes 86704, 86706, 87340
    and 87341

    pregnant adolescents and adults who do meet the high risk definition
    above.

-   Repeat screening for high risk persons is covered annually only for
    persons who have continued high risk who do not receive hepatitis B
    vaccination .

> Note: Annual means a full 11 months must elapse following the month in
> which the previous negative screening took place.
>
> Note for ESRD: Effective for claims with dates of service on or after
> September 28, 2016 submitted with G0499 -- "HepB screen high risk
> indiv, for asymptomatic non-pregnant beneficiaries" and ICD-10
> diagnosis code N18.6, End Stage Renal Disease, all of the preceding
> requirements shall be bypassed and the claim shall be allowed to pay,
> no matter what other ICD-10 diagnosis codes may appear on the claim.

## HBV screening for pregnant women (CPT codes 86704, 86706, 87340 and 87341)

-   One occurrence per pregnancy of screening for HBV in pregnant women,
    and

-   One additional occurrence per pregnancy of screening for HBV in
    pregnant women who are at continued risk

B.  Determination of High Risk for Hepatitis B Disease

> The determination of "high risk for HBV" is identified by the primary
> care physician or practitioner who assesses the patient's history,
> which is part of any complete medical history, typically part of an
> annual wellness visit, and considered in the development of a
> comprehensive prevention plan. The medical record should be a
> reflection of the service provided.
