# - Where to Bill DMEPOS and PEN Items and Services

## (Rev. 11414; Issued: 05-12-22; Effective: 06-13-22; Implementation: 06-13-22)

> **NOTE:** CMS seeks to reduce burden and modernize processes to ensure
> a reduction in improper payments and an increase in customer
> satisfaction. The Certificate of Medical Necessity (CMN) form and DME
> Information Form (DIF) were originally required to help document the
> medical necessity and other coverage criteria for selected Durable
> Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS)
> items. In the past, a supplier received a signed CMN from the treating
> physician or created and signed a DIF to submit with the claim. Due to
> improvements in claims processing and medical records management, the
> information found on CMNs or DIFs is available either on the claim or
> in the medical record and is redundant. Therefore, to reduce burden
> and increase customer satisfaction, providers and suppliers no longer
> need to submit these forms for services rendered after January 1,
> 2023.

-   **[For claims with dates of service on or after January 1,
    > 2023]{.underline}** -- providers and suppliers no longer need to
    > submit CMNs or DIFs with claims. Due to electronic filing
    > requirements, claims received with these forms attached will be
    > rejected and returned to the provider or supplier.

-   **[For claims with dates of service prior to January 1,
    > 2023]{.underline}** -- processes will not change and if the CMN or
    > DIF is required, it will still need to be submitted with the
    > claim, or be on file with a previous claim.

> This statement applies throughout the Program Integrity Manual
> wherever CMNs and DIFs are mentioned.
>
> Skilled Nursing Facilities, CORFs, OPTs, and hospitals bill the A/B
> MAC Part A for prosthetic/orthotic devices, supplies, and covered
> outpatient DME and oxygen (refer to
>
> §40). The HHAs should bill Durable Medical Equipment (DME) to the A/B
> MAC (HHH), or should meet the requirements of a DME supplier and bill
> the DME MAC. This is the HHA\'s decision. A/B MACs Part A other than
> A/B MACs (HHH) will receive claims only for the class \"Prosthetic and
> Orthotic Devices.\"
>
> Unless billing to the A/B MAC Part A is required as outlined in the
> preceding paragraph, claims for implanted DME, implanted prosthetic
> devices, replacement parts, accessories and supplies for the implanted
> DME shall be billed to the A/B MACs Part B and not the DME MAC.
>
> Suppliers enrolled with the NSC as a DMEPOS supplier should enroll
> with and bill to the A/B MAC Part B for replacement parts, accessories
> and supplies for prosthetic implants and surgically implanted DME
> items that are not required to be billed to the A/B MAC Part A as
> stated above. Such suppliers should bill the A/B MAC Part B for these
> items only, unless the entity separately qualified as a supplier for
> items and/or services in another benefit category.
>
> Suppliers that enroll with the NSC as a DMEPOS supplier shall bill the
> A/B MAC Part B using their NPI and shall not include their NSC number
> on the claim.
>
> Under no circumstances should any entity that is enrolled as a DMEPOS
> supplier with the NSC, that is not the physician or provider that
> implants the device, bill the A/B MAC Part B for an implanted device.
> However, DMEPOS suppliers should bill for any of the replacement
> parts, accessories or supplies for prosthetic implants and surgically
> implanted DME.
>
> The claims filing jurisdiction for these items is determined by the
> supplier's location, in accordance with Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims
> Processing Manual, chapter 1, section 10. With respect to payment for
> these items, contractors are reminded of the longstanding policy for
> payment of DMEPOS items, which specifies that payment for DMEPOS is
> based on the fee schedule amount for the State where the beneficiary
> maintains his/her permanent residence.
>
> The Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes that
> describe these categories of service are updated quarterly. All other
> DMEPOS items are billed to the DME MAC. See the Medicare Claims
> Processing Manual, Chapter 23, §20.3 for additional information. A
> spreadsheet containing an updated list of HCPCS for which DME MACs
> have jurisdiction is updated as needed (typically quarterly) to

# - Beneficiaries Previously Enrolled in Managed Care Who Return to Traditional Fee for Service (FFS)

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> **B3-9051**
>
> When a beneficiary who was previously enrolled in a Medicare
> HMO/Managed Care program returns to traditional FFS, he or she is
> subject to all benefits, rules, requirements and coverage criteria as
> a beneficiary who has always been enrolled in FFS. When a beneficiary
> returns to FFS, it is as though he or she has become eligible for
> Medicare for the first time. Therefore, if a beneficiary received any
> items or services from their HMO or Managed Care plan, they may
> continue to receive such items and services only if they would be
> entitled to them under Medicare FFS coverage criteria and
> documentation requirements.
>
> For example, if a beneficiary received a manual wheelchair under a
> HMO/Managed Care plan, he or she would need to meet Medicare coverage
> criteria and documentation requirements for manual wheelchairs. He or
> she would have to obtain a Certificate of Medical Necessity (CMN), and
> would begin an entirely new rental period, just as a beneficiary
> enrolled in FFS, to obtain a manual wheelchair for the first time.
>
> There is an exception to this rule if a beneficiary was previously
> enrolled in FFS and received a capped rental item, then enrolled in an
> HMO, stayed with the HMO for 60 or fewer days, then returned to FFS.
> For purposes of this instruction, CMS has interpreted an end to
> medical necessity to include enrollment in an HMO for 60 or more days.
>
> Another partial exception to this rule involves home oxygen claims. If
> a beneficiary has been receiving oxygen while under a Medicare HMO,
> the supplier must obtain an initial CMN and submit it to the DME MAC
> at the time that FFS coverage begins. However, the beneficiary does
> not have to obtain the blood gas study on the CMN within 30 days prior
> to the Initial Certification date on the CMN, but the test must be the
> most recent study the patient obtained while in the HMO, under the
> guidelines specified in DME MAC policy. It is important to note that,
> just because a beneficiary qualified for oxygen under a Medicare HMO,
> it does not necessarily follow that he/she will qualify for oxygen
> under FFS.
>
> Another partial exception to this rule involves home oxygen claims. If
> a beneficiary has been receiving oxygen while under a Medicare HMO,
> the supplier must obtain an initial CMN and submit it to the DME MAC

> (HMO) program.

# - Calculation and Update of Payment Rates

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> **B3-5017, PM B-01-54, 2002 PEN Fee Schedule**
>
> Section1834 of the Act requires the use of fee schedules under
> Medicare Part B for reimbursement of durable medical equipment (DME)
> and for prosthetic and orthotic devices, beginning January 1 1989.
> Payment is limited to the lower of the actual charge for the equipment
> or the fee established.
>
> Beginning with fee schedule year 1991, CMS calculates the updates for
> the fee schedules and national limitation amounts and provides the A/B
> MACs (A), (B), (HHH), and DME MACs with the revised payment amounts.
> The CMS calculates most fee schedule amounts and provides them to the
> A/B MACs (A), (B), and (HHH), and DME MACs.
>
> However, for some services CMS asks A/B MACs (B) to calculate local
> fee amounts and to provide them to CMS to include in calculation of
> national amounts. These vary from update to update, and CMS issues
> special related instructions to A/B MACs (B) when appropriate.
>
> Parenteral and enteral nutrition services paid on and after January 1,
> 2002 are paid on a fee schedule. This fee schedule also is furnished
> by CMS. Prior to 2002, payment amounts for PEN were determined under
> reasonable charge rules, including the application of the lowest
> charge level (LCL) restrictions.
>
> The CMS furnishes fee schedule updates (DMEPOS, PEN, etc.) at least 30
> days prior to the scheduled implementation. A/B MACs (A), and (HHH)
> use the fee schedules to pay for covered items, within their claims
> processing jurisdictions, supplied by hospitals, home health agencies,
> and other providers. A/B MACs (A) and (HHH) consult with DME MACs and,
> where appropriate with A/B MACs (B), on filling gaps in fee schedules.
>
> The CMS furnishes the fee amounts annually, or as updated if special
> updates should occur during the year, to A/B MACs (A), (B), (HHH), and
> DME MACs and the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), Specialty MAC
> (SMAC), and to other interested parties (including the Pricing, Data
> Analysis and Coding Contractor (PDAC), RRB, Indian Health Service, and
> United Mine Workers).

# - Elimination of \"Kit\" Codes and Pricing of Replacement Codes

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) PM B-01-56

> Prior to 2002, most suppliers billed for dialysis supplies using codes
> describing \"kits\" of supplies. The use of kit codes allowed
> suppliers to bill for supply items without separately identifying the
> supplies that are being furnished to the patient. Effective January 1,

# - General Payment Rules

## (Rev. 11414; Issued: 05-12-22; Effective: 06-13-22; Implementation: 06-13-22)

> **NOTE:** CMS seeks to reduce burden and modernize processes to ensure
> a reduction in improper payments and an increase in customer
> satisfaction. The Certificate of Medical Necessity (CMN) form and DME
> Information Form (DIF) were originally required to help document the
> medical necessity and other coverage criteria for selected Durable
> Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS)
> items. In the past, a supplier received a signed CMN from the treating
> physician or created and signed a DIF to submit with the claim. Due to
> improvements in claims processing and medical records management, the
> information found on CMNs or DIFs is available either on the claim or
> in the medical record and is redundant. Therefore, to reduce burden
> and increase customer satisfaction, providers and suppliers no longer
> need to submit these forms for services rendered after January 1,
> 2023.

-   **[For claims with dates of service on or after January 1,
    > 2023]{.underline}** -- providers and suppliers no longer need to
    > submit CMNs or DIFs with claims. Due to electronic filing
    > requirements, claims received with these forms attached will be
    > rejected and returned to the provider or supplier.

-   **[For claims with dates of service prior to January 1,
    > 2023]{.underline}** -- processes will not change and if the CMN or
    > DIF is required, it will still need to be submitted with the
    > claim, or be on file with a previous claim.

> This statement applies throughout the Program Integrity Manual
> wherever CMNs and DIFs are mentioned.

## B3-5102

> DMEPOS are categorized into one of the following payment classes:

-   Inexpensive or other routinely purchased DME;

-   Items requiring frequent and substantial servicing;

-   Certain customized items;

-   Other prosthetic and orthotic devices;

-   Capped rental items; or

-   Oxygen and oxygen equipment.

> The CMS determines the category that applies to each HCPSC code and
> issues instructions when changes are appropriate. See
> [[§§130]{.underline}](#billing-for-durable-medical-equipment-dme-and-orthotic-prosthetic-devices)
> for billing information for each payment class.
>
> DME, including DME furnished under the home health benefit and Part B
> DME benefit, is paid on the basis of the fee schedule.
>
> Oxygen and oxygen equipment are paid on the basis of a fee schedule.
>
> Any DME or oxygen furnished to inpatients under a Part A covered stay
> is included in the SNF or hospital PPS rate. When an inpatient in a
> hospital or SNF is not entitled to Part A inpatient benefits, payment
> may not be made under Part B for DME or oxygen provided in the
> hospital or SNF because such facilities do not qualify as a patient\'s
> home. The definition of DME in §1861(n) of the Act provides that DME
> is covered by Part B only when intended for use in the home, which
> explicitly does not include a SNF or hospital. (See the Medicare
> Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15). This does not preclude separate
> billing for DME furnished after discharge.
>
> Payment to providers and suppliers other than Home Health Agencies
> (HHAs) for supplies that are necessary for the effective use of DME is
> made on the basis of a fee schedule, except that payment for drugs is

    1.  # - Inexpensive or Other Routinely Purchased DME

## (Rev.4027; Issued: 04-27-18; Effective: 10-01-18; Implementation: 10-01-18)

> For this type of equipment, A/B MACs (A), (B), or (HHH), and DME MACs
> pay for rentals or lump-sum purchases. However, with the exception of
> TENS (see
>
> §30.1.2), the total payment amount may not exceed the actual charge or
> the fee schedule amount for purchase.

## Inexpensive DME

> This category is defined as equipment whose purchase price does not
> exceed
>
> \$150.

## Other Routinely Purchased DME

> This category is defined as equipment that is acquired at least 75
> percent of the time by purchase and includes equipment that is an
> accessory used in conjunction with a nebulizer, aspirator, or
> ventilators that are either continuous airway pressure devices or
> intermittent assist devices with continuous airway pressure devices.
> Effective October 1, 2015, this category also includes speech
> generating devices and accessories necessary for the effective use of
> speech generating devices.

# - Used Equipment

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> For payment purposes, used equipment is considered routinely purchased
> equipment and is any equipment that has been purchased or rented by
> someone before the current purchase transaction. Used equipment also
> includes equipment that has been used under circumstances where there
> has been no commercial transaction (e.g., equipment used for trial
> periods or as a demonstrator).
>
> However, if a beneficiary rented a piece of brand new equipment and
> subsequently purchased it, the payment amount for the purchase should
> be high enough so that the total combined rental and purchase amounts
> at least equal the fee schedule for the purchase of comparable new
> equipment. The payment amount may be established in this manner only
> to the extent it does not exceed the actual charge made for the
> purchase.
>
> **EXAMPLES:** The fee schedule amounts for an item of DME are
> ordinarily as follows:
>
> \$500 for purchase when the item is new.
>
> \$375 for purchase when the item is used.
>
> \$50 per month for renting the item.
>
> Situation 1: A beneficiary rented the item when it was brand new for
> one month and then purchased it for \$500. The amount allowed for the
> purchase is \$450 (i.e., \$500 minus the
>
> \$50 allowed for the one month of rental) rather than \$375.
>
> Situation 2: A beneficiary rented the item for one month when it was
> brand new and then purchased it for \$400. The amount allowed for the
> purchase is \$400 rather than the \$450 that is allowable in situation
> 1 since the payment amount may not exceed the actual charge for an
> item.

# 30.1.1.2 - Used Rental Equipment

## (Rev. 3443, Issued: 01-29-16, Effective: 07-01-16, Implementation: 07-05-16)

> When a beneficiary elects to purchase previously rented inexpensive
> and routinely purchased DME and the service has a UE (purchase of used
> equipment) modifier the Medicare allowed amount for used purchased
> equipment will be calculated at the lower of the purchase fee schedule
> amount (UE) minus previous paid rental amounts or the actual charge
> for the used purchased equipment.

# - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (TENS)

## (Rev. 2605, Issued: 11-30-12, Effective: 06-08-12, Implementation: 01-07-13)

> In order to permit an attending physician time to determine whether
> the purchase of a TENS is medically appropriate for a particular
> patient, MACs pay 10 percent of the purchase price of the item for
> each of 2 months. The purchase price and payment for maintenance and
> servicing are determined under the same rules as any other frequently
> purchased item, except that there is no reduction in the allowed
> amount for purchase due to the two months rental.
>
> Effective June 8, 2012, CMS will allow coverage for TENS use in the
> treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP) only under specific
> conditions which are described in the NCD Manual, Pub. 100-03, chapter
> 1 Section 160.27.

# - Items Requiring Frequent and Substantial Servicing

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) A3-3629

> For this type of equipment, MACs pay the fee schedule amounts on a
> rental basis until medical necessity ends. MACs cannot pay for
> purchase of this type of equipment.

# - Daily Payment for Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) Devices

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> The CPM devices (HCPCS code E0935) are classified as items requiring
> frequent and substantial servicing and are covered as DME as follows
> (see the Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual.):

-   Continuous passive motion devices are covered for patients who have
    > received a total knee replacement. To qualify for coverage, use of
    > the device must commence within 2 days following surgery. In
    > addition, coverage is limited to that portion of the 3 week period
    > following surgery during which the device is used in the
    > patient\'s home.

> MACs make payment for each day that the device is used in the
> patient\'s home. No payment can be made for the device when the device
> is not used in the patient\'s home or once the 21 day period has
> elapsed. Since it is possible for a patient to receive CPM services in
> their home on the date that they are discharged from the hospital,
> this date counts as the first day of the three week limited coverage
> period.

# - Certain Customized Items

## (Rev. 2687, Issued: 04-19-13, Effective: 01-01-92, Implementation: 07-19-13)

> Customized items are rarely necessary and are rarely furnished. In
> accordance with 42 CFR Section 414.224, in order to be considered a
> customized item, a covered item (including a wheelchair) must be
> uniquely constructed or substantially modified for a specific
> beneficiary according to the description and orders of a physician and
> be so different from another item used for the same purpose that the
> two items cannot be grouped together for pricing purposes. For
> example, a wheelchair that is custom fabricated or substantially
> modified so that it can meet the needs of wheelchair-confined,
> conjoined twins facing each other is unique and cannot be grouped with
> any other wheelchair used for the same purpose. It is a one-of-a-kind
> item fabricated to meet specific needs. Items that are measured,
> assembled, fitted, or adapted in consideration of a patient's body
> size, weight, disability, period of need, or intended use (i.e.,
> custom fitted items) or have been assembled by a supplier or ordered
> from a manufacturer who makes available customized features,
> modification or components for wheelchairs that are intended for an
> individual patient's use in accordance with instructions from the
> patient's physician do not meet the definition of customized items.
> These items are not uniquely constructed or substantially modified and
> can be grouped with other items for pricing purposes. The use of
> customized options or accessories or custom fitting of certain parts
> does not result in a wheelchair or other equipment being considered as
> customized. The item must be uniquely constructed using raw materials
> or there must be a necessary, substantial modification to the base
> equipment (e.g., wheelchair frame) for the item to be considered a
> customized item.
>
> Section 414.224 (b) provides that payment is made for the lump sum
> purchase of the item based on the MAC's individual consideration and
> judgment of a reasonable payment amount for each customized item. The
> MAC's individual consideration takes into account written
> documentation on the costs (including design, fabrication, and
> assembly costs) of the item including at least the cost of labor, to
> the extent that they are
>
> reasonable, of those actually performing the customization. The MAC's
> individual consideration also takes into account the cost of the types
> of materials, to the extent that they are reasonable, used in custom
> fabricating or substantially modifying an item. The MAC may need to
> require a detailed description of each phase of the construction
> process and labor skills needed to fabricate or modify the item in
> order to determine a reasonable amount.
>
> MACs shall submit quarterly reports to CMS on the items they have
> determined meet the definition of customized items and how they
> reached the conclusion for each item.
>
> MACs shall include in these reports the reasonable payment amount
> determinations and factors they considered in determining the
> reasonable payment amount for each item.
>
> The definition of customized DME set forth in regulations at 42 CFR
> Section 414.224 is based on the longstanding definition of customized
> DME used in making decisions regarding when to make individual payment
> determinations outside the normal process for calculating customary
> and prevailing charges under the reasonable charge payment methodology
> used for DME prior to 1989. Public Law 101-508, Omnibus Budget
> Reconciliation Act (OBRA), November 5, 1990 (104 Stat. 1388-79)
> amended the criteria for treatment of wheelchair as 'a customized item
> at section 1834 (a) (4) of the Social Security Act by adding a clause
> that in case of a wheelchair furnished on or after January 1, 1992,
> the wheelchair shall be treated as a customized item if the wheelchair
> has been measured, fitted, or adapted in consideration of the
> patient's body size, disability period of need, or intended use, and
> has been assembled by a supplier or ordered from a manufacturer who
> makes available customized features, modification or components for
> wheelchairs that are intended for an individual patient's use in
> accordance with instructions from the patient's physician. The
> amendment further noted that this clause applied only to items
> furnished on or after January 1, 1992, unless the Secretary developed

> ownership of the equipment remains with the supplier (see
> [[§30.5.4]{.underline}](#payments-for-capped-rental-items-during-a-period-of-continuous-use)).
> In the case of electric wheelchairs only, the beneficiary must be
> given a purchase option at the time the equipment is first provided
> (see
> §[[30.5.3]{.underline}](#purchase-option-for-capped-rental-items)).

# - Capped Rental Fee Variation by Month of Rental

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> For the first three rental months, the capped rental fee schedule is
> calculated so as to limit the monthly rental to 10 percent of the
> average of allowed purchase prices on assigned claims for new
> equipment during a base period, updated to account for inflation. For
> each of the remaining months, the monthly rental is limited to 7.5
> percent of the average allowed purchase price. After paying the rental
> fee schedule amount for 15 months, no further payment may be made
> except for the 6-month maintenance and servicing fee (see
>
> [[§40.2]{.underline}](#maintenance-and-service-of-capped-rental-items)).

# - Purchase Option for Capped Rental Items

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Effective May 1, 1991, suppliers must give beneficiaries the option of
> converting their capped rental equipment to purchased equipment during
> their 10th continuous rental month. DME MACs and A/B MACs (HHH) make
> no further rental payments after the 11th rental month for capped
> rental items until the supplier notifies the DME MAC or A/B MAC (HHH)
> that it has contacted the beneficiary and furnished him/her with the
> option of either purchase or continued rental. Information contained
> in Exhibit 1 may be furnished to beneficiaries by suppliers to help
> them make a rent/purchase decision. DME MACs and A/B MACs (HHH)
> provide copies of Exhibit 1 to suppliers. Beneficiaries have one month
> from the date the supplier makes the offer to accept this option. If
> the
>
> beneficiary declines or fails to respond to the purchase option, the
> A/B MAC (HHH) or DME MAC continues to make rental payments until the
> 15-month rental cap is reached.
>
> If the beneficiary accepts the purchase option, the DME MAC or A/B MAC
> (HHH) continues making rental payments until a total of 13 continuous
> rental months have been paid. The DME MAC or A/B MAC (HHH) will not
> make any additional rental payments beyond the 13th rental month. On
> the first day after 13 continuous rental months have been paid, the

# - Additional Purchase Option for Electric Wheelchairs

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Effective May 1, 1991, suppliers must give beneficiaries entitled to
> electric wheelchairs the option of purchasing them at the time the
> supplier first furnishes the item. DME MACs or A/B MACs (HHH) make no
> rental payment for the first month for electric wheelchairs until the
> supplier notifies the MAC that it has given the beneficiary the option
> of either purchasing or renting. Information contained in Exhibit 2
> may be furnished to beneficiaries by suppliers to help them make a
> rent/purchase decision.
>
> MACs provide copies of Exhibit 2 to suppliers. Payment must be on a
> lump-sum fee schedule purchase basis where the beneficiary chooses the
> purchase option. If the beneficiary declines to purchase the electric
> wheelchair initially, MACs make rental payments in the same manner as
> any other capped rental item, including the instructions in
> [[§30.5.2]{.underline}](#purchase-option-for-capped-rental-items).

# - Exhibits

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> **Exhibit 1 - The Rent/Purchase Option**
>
> You have been renting your (specify the item(s) of equipment) for 10
> continuous rental months. Medicare requires (specify name of supplier)
> to give you the option of converting your rental agreement to a
> purchase agreement. This means that if you accept this option, you
> would own the medical equipment. If you accept the purchase option,
> Medicare continues making rental payments for your equipment for 3
> additional rental months. You are responsible for the 20 percent
> coinsurance amounts and, for unassigned claims, the balance between
> the Medicare allowed amount and the supplier\'s charge.
>
> After making these additional rental payments, title to the equipment
> is transferred to you. You have until (specify the date one month from
> the date the supplier notifies the patient of this option) to elect
> the purchase option. If you decide not to elect the purchase option,
> Medicare continues making rental payments for an additional 5 rental
> months, a total of 15 months. You are responsible for the 20 percent
> coinsurance amounts and, for unassigned claims, the balance between
> the Medicare allowed amount and the supplier\'s charge. After a total
> of 15 rental months have been paid, title to the equipment remains
> with the medical equipment supplier; however, the supplier may not
> charge you any additional rental amounts.
>
> In making your decision to rent or purchase the equipment, you should
> know that for purchased equipment your supplier may charge you each
> time your equipment is actually serviced. You are responsible for the
> 20 percent coinsurance amounts and, for unassigned claims, the balance
> between the Medicare allowed amount and the supplier\'s charge.
> However, for equipment that is rented for 15 months, your
> responsibility for such service is limited to 20 percent coinsurance

# Exhibit 2 - How Medicare Pays For Electric Wheelchairs

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> If you need an electric wheelchair prescribed by your doctor, you may
> already know that Medicare can help pay for it. Medicare requires
> (specify name of supplier) to give you the option of either renting or
> purchasing it. If you decide that purchase is more economical, for
> example, because you will need the electric wheelchair for a long
> time, Medicare pays 80 percent of the allowed purchase price in a lump
> sum amount. You are responsible for the 20 percent coinsurance amounts
> and, for unassigned claims, the balance between the Medicare allowed
> amount and the supplier\'s charge. However, you must elect to purchase
> the electric wheelchair at the time your medical equipment supplier
> furnishes you the item. If you elect to rent the electric wheelchair,
> you are again given the option of purchasing it during your 10th
> rental month.
>
> If you continue to rent the electric wheelchair for 10 months,
> Medicare requires (specify name of supplier) to give you the option of
> converting your rental agreement to a purchase agreement. This means
> that if you accept this option, you would own the medical equipment.
> If you accept the purchase option, Medicare continues making rental
> payments for your equipment for 3 additional rental months. You are
> responsible for the 20 percent coinsurance amounts and, for unassigned
> claims, the balance between the Medicare allowed amount and the
> supplier\'s charge. After these additional rental payments are made,
> title to the equipment is transferred to you. You have until (specify
> the date one month from the date the supplier notifies the patient of
> this option) to elect the purchase option. If you decide not to elect
> the purchase option, Medicare continues making rental payments for an
> additional 5 rental months, a total of 15 months. After a total of 15
> rental months have been paid, title to the equipment remains with the
> medical equipment supplier; however, the supplier may not charge you
> any additional rental amounts.
>
> In making your decision to rent or purchase the equipment, you should
> know that for purchased equipment, you are responsible for 20 percent
> of the service charge each time your equipment is actually serviced
> and, for unassigned claims, the balance between the Medicare allowed
> amount and the supplier\'s charge. However, for equipment that is

> to 20 percent coinsurance on a maintenance and servicing fee payable
> twice per year whether or not the equipment is actually serviced.

# - Payments for Capped Rental Items During a Period of Continuous Use

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> When no purchase options have been exercised, rental payments may not
> exceed a period of continuous use of longer than 15 months. For the
> month of death or discontinuance of use, DME MACs and A/B MACs (HHH)
> pay the full month rental. After 15 months of rental have been paid,
> the supplier must continue to provide the item without any charge,
> other than for the maintenance and servicing fees (see
> §[[40.2]{.underline}](#maintenance-and-service-of-capped-rental-items))
> until medical necessity ends or Medicare coverage ceases (e.g., the
> patient enrolls in an M+C organization). For this purpose, unless
> there is a break in need for at least 60 days, medical necessity is
> presumed to continue. If a supplier makes any additional rental
> charges, DME MACs and A/B MACs (HHH) should report questionable
> situations to the RO of the Inspector General.
>
> A period of continuous use allows for temporary interruptions in the
> use of equipment. Interruptions may last up to 60 consecutive days
> plus the days remaining in the rental month (this does not mean
> calendar month, but the 30-day rental period) in which use ceases,
> regardless of the reason the interruption occurs. Thus, if the
> interruption is less than 60 consecutive days plus the days remaining
> in the rental month in which use ceases, DME MACs and A/B MACs (HHH)
> will not begin a new 15-month rental period. Also, when an
> interruption continues beyond the end of the rental month in which the
> use ceases, MACs will not make payment for additional rental until use
> of the item resumes. MACs will establish a new date of service when
> use resumes. Unpaid months of interruption do not count toward the
> 15-month limit.
>
> **EXAMPLE:** A patient rents an item of equipment for 12 months and is
> then institutionalized for 45 days. Upon his discharge from the
> institution, the patient resumes use of the equipment and is
> considered to be in his 13th month of rental (since the period of
> institutionalization is not counted) for purposes of calculating the
> 15-month rental period. Moreover, for the period he was
> institutionalized, no payment is made for the item of equipment. If
> the supplier desires, it may pick up the item of equipment during the
> patient\'s hospitalization but is required to return the item upon the
> patient\'s return home.
>
> If, however, the interruption is greater than 60 consecutive days
> (plus the days remaining in the rental month in which need ceases) and
> the supplier submits a new prescription, new medical necessity
> documentation and a statement describing the reason for the
> interruption which shows that medical necessity in the prior episode
> ended, a new 15- month period begins. If the supplier does not submit
> this documentation, a new 15- month period does not begin.
>
> As a general rule, DME MACs and A/B MACs (HHH) accept written
> documentation from suppliers without further development. However,
> although it is expected that such circumstances are limited in number,
> they do represent an opportunity for abuse.
>
> Therefore, if a pattern of frequent interruptions in excess of 60 days
> occurs, MACs will
>
> institute a thorough medical review of the supplier\'s claims. MACs
> should report questionable situations to the RO of the Inspector
> General.
>
> If a 15-month rental period has already ended and a greater than 60
> consecutive day interruption occurs, MACs will subject any claims
> purporting to be a new period of medical necessity after the
> interruption to a thorough medical review to ensure that medical
> necessity did in fact end after the prior episode.
>
> Additional issues relating to the term \"continuous\" follow. Change
> of Address
>
> If the beneficiary moves during or after the 15-month period, either
> permanently or temporarily, it does not result in a new rental
> episode.
>
> Modifications or Substitutions of Equipment
>
> If the beneficiary changes equipment to different but similar
> equipment, DME MACs and A/B MACs (HHH) may refer the claim to their
> medical review unit. If, after thorough review, they conclude that the
> beneficiary\'s medical needs have substantially changed and the new
> equipment is necessary, DME MACs will begin a new 15-month period. The
> supplier providing equipment during the 10^th^ month must also provide
> the purchase option. Otherwise, they will continue to count against
> the current 15-month limit and base payment on the least expensive
> medically appropriate configuration of equipment (if the 15-month
> period had already expired, they will make no additional rental
> payments). The principles are described in the Medicare Benefit Policy
> Manual, Chapter 15.
>
> If the new configuration is a modification of existing equipment
> through the addition of medically necessary features (e.g., a special
> purpose back is added to a wheelchair), DME MACs and A/B MACs will
> continue the 15-month rental period for the original equipment and
> begin a new 15-month rental period for the added equipment.
>
> Change in Suppliers
>
> If the beneficiary changes suppliers during or after the 15-month
> rental period, this does not result in a new rental episode. For
> example, if the beneficiary changes suppliers after his 8th rental
> month, the new supplier is entitled to the monthly rental fee for
> seven additional months (15 - 8). The supplier that provides the item
> in the 15th month of the rental period is responsible for supplying
> the equipment and for maintenance and servicing after the 15-month
> period (see
> [[§40.2]{.underline}](#maintenance-and-service-of-capped-rental-items)).

# - Elimination of Method II Home Dialysis

## (Rev. 2487, Issued: 06-08-12, Effective: 01-01-11, Implementation: 06-19-12)

> Effective for dates of service on and after January 1, 2011, Section

> ESRD patients that previously selected Method II are covered under
> Method I. All home dialysis claims must be billed by an ESRD facility

> CMS-382 form to the A/B MACs (A) or DME MACs is no longer required for
> home dialysis patients on or after January 1, 2011.
>
> Method II claims will not be accepted for dates of service on or after
> January 1, 2011. Method II claims for dates of service prior to
> January 1, 2011 will continue to be processed within normal timely
> filing limitations. For more information on timely filing, see Pub.
> 100-04, Chapter 1, Sections 70 through 70.8.6.
>
> For dates of service on or after January 1, 2011, MACs shall continue
> to allow separate billing for certain ESRD supply HCPCS codes subject
> to the ESRD PPS consolidated billing requirements when submitted by
> suppliers for services not related to the beneficiary's ESRD dialysis

# 80 - Penalty Charges for Late Payment Not Included in Reasonable Charges or Fee Schedule Amounts

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-5106.1

> Penalty charges imposed on a beneficiary by a physician or supplier
> because of failure to make timely payment on a bill are not covered
> under Medicare.
>
> **NOTE:** The Judicial Council of the American Medical Association has
> ruled that, \"It is not in the best interest of the public or the
> profession to charge a penalty if fees for professional services are
> not paid within a prescribed period of time, nor is it proper to
> charge a patient a flat collection fee if it becomes necessary to
> refer the amount to an agency for collection.\"

# 90 - Payment for Additional Expenses for Deluxe Features

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> **B3-5107, PM AB-02-114**
>
> The payment amount for a given service or item, whether rented or
> purchased, must be consistent with what is reasonable and medically
> necessary to serve the intended purpose (See the Medicare Benefit
> Policy Manual, Chapter 15). Additional expenses for \"deluxe\"
> features, or items that are rented or purchased for aesthetic reasons
> or added convenience, do not meet the reasonableness test. Thus, where
> a service or item is medically necessary and covered under the
> Medicare program, and the patient wishes to obtain such deluxe
> features, the payment is based upon the payment amount for the kind of
> service or item normally used to meet the intended purpose (i.e., the
> standard item.) Usually this is the least costly item. DME MACs may,
> of course, determine that the payment amount for a more expensive
> service or item is reasonable when the additional expense is for an
> added feature that is medically necessary in a given case. For
> example, a more expensive item may be medically necessary where a
> patient in a weakened condition needs a power- operated wheelchair or
> a power-operated vehicle that may be appropriately used as a
> wheelchair since the patient is not strong enough to operate a manual
> wheelchair.
>
> Finally the provider may not charge the beneficiary for features not
> medically required by his/her condition and which cannot be considered
> in determining the provider\'s allowable costs unless the beneficiary
> or her/his representative has specifically requested the excessive or
> deluxe items or services with knowledge of the amount s/he is to be
> charged. An Advance Beneficiary Notification (ABN) is required as
> documentation that the beneficiary has made such an informed request.
> See Chapter 30 for ABN requirements.
>
> The acceptance of an assignment binds the supplier-assignee to accept
> the allowed charge for the medically required equipment or service as
> the full charge and he cannot charge the beneficiary the differential
> attributable to the equipment actually furnished.
>
> Only if a more expensive item or model with special features is
> medically necessary for the beneficiary will the allowed charge be
> based on the more expensive model. If the patient purchases or rents
> an item of durable medical equipment having more expensive features
> than his condition requires, the supplier accepting assignment on such
> an item cannot charge or collect any amount in excess of the allowed
> charge for the appliance adequate for the patient\'s needs. Acceptance
> of assignment binds the supplier to accept the allowed charge
> determined by the DME MAC, as the full charge for the item. A supplier
> who wishes to charge and collect the full price for equipment more
> expensive than medically required by the patient need not accept
> assignment. In assignment cases, the beneficiary is responsible for
> paying the supplier the unpaid balance of the allowed charge when
> payments stop because his condition has changed and the equipment is
> no longer medically necessary. Similarly, when payments stop because
> the beneficiary dies, his/her estate is responsible to the supplier
> for such unpaid balance.

# - Scheduling and Documenting Certifications and Recertifications of Medical Necessity for PEN

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> A certification for PEN therapy must accompany the initial claim
> submitted. The initial certification is valid for six months. DME MACs
> establish the schedule on a case-by- case basis for recertifying the
> need for PEN therapy. A change in prescription for a beneficiary past
> the initial certification period does not restart the certification

>
> A period of medical necessity ends when PEN services are not medically
> required for 2 consecutive months. The entire certification process,
> if required, begins after 2 consecutive months have elapsed.
>
> A revised certification or a change in prescription may impact on the
> payment levels of PEN services. A revised certification is appropriate
> when there is a change:

-   In the treating physician\'s orders in the category of nutrients
    > and/or calories prescribed;

-   By more than one liter in the daily volume of parenteral solutions;

-   From home-mix to pre-mix or pre-mix to home-mix parenteral
    > solutions;

-   From enteral to parenteral or parenteral to enteral therapy; or

-   In the method of infusion (e.g., from gravity-fed to pump-fed).

# - Completion of the Elements of PEN CMN

> both the Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) and the Medicare
> Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) during the new Medicare card transition

>
> The patient\'s name, address, and Medicare beneficiary identifier and
> the nature of the certification (i.e., initial, renewed, or revised)
> must be entered on all certifications by the supplier, physician, or

>
> All medical and prescription information must be completed from the
> patient\'s records by the attending/ordering physician, or an employee
> of the physician authorized to act on the physician\'s behalf, and

1.  Place of Service - The CMN must identify the site where the patient
    > is receiving PEN services. A patient may receive services at home,
    > in a nursing home setting (e.g., skilled nursing facility), or
    > another site that must be indicated by the supplier/physician.

2.  Patient\'s General Condition - The attending physician must complete
    > information about the patient\'s age, height, and weight. The
    > general condition of the patient also includes an estimated
    > duration of therapy (i.e., in months, years, or for life), the

    > physician should also indicate food allergies/sensitivities, other
    > medical treatments, therapies, and/or medical conditions that may
    > affect the patient\'s nutritional needs.

3.  Patient\'s Clinical Assessment - The attending physician must
    > indicate all the diagnoses related to the PEN therapy and describe
    > the patient\'s functional impairment of the digestive tract that
    > precludes the enteral patient from swallowing and the parenteral
    > patient from absorbing nutrients. The physician must certify that
    > PEN therapy meets the requirement that a patient is not able to
    > maintain weight and strength due to pathology or nonfunction of
    > the ingestion system and that the enteral therapy serves as the
    > source of nutrition for the patient who has a functioning
    > digestive tract, but whose disability prevents ingestion of
    > sufficient nutrients to the alimentary tract for metabolism.
    > Nutritional supplements for patients capable of ingesting
    > normally, even if required to maintain weight and strength, cannot
    > be covered under the prosthetic device benefit. The physician must
    > have a basis for certifying or recertifying the need for PEN
    > services. The physician is expected to see the patient within 30
    > days prior to certifying or recertifying PEN services. However, if
    > the physician did not see the patient, he/she must explain why and
    > describe what other monitoring methods were used to evaluate the
    > patient\'s PEN needs.

4.  Patient\'s Nutritional Prescription - Subsequent to an examination
    > of the patient and/or a review of the patient\'s medical
    > information, the attending physician must complete the patient\'s
    > nutritional requirements (prescription) to certify the PEN therapy
    > provided.

> For the parenteral patient, the CMN must contain the following
> information:

-   The infusion frequency per week,

-   The route of administration,

-   A reason for the use of pre-mixed parenteral formulas,

-   An explanation for the use of special formulas such as hepatic,
    > renal, or stress

-   formulas, and

-   The amino acid/dextrose formula components of the parenteral
    > solution mix.

> Amino acids serve as a source of protein. Adult parenteral nutrition
> patients generally need 1 to 1.5 grams of protein per day for each
> kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight. Dextrose concentrations less
> than 10 percent must be explained by the physician. The physician must
> document the reason for using more than 12 units (@ 500ml per unit) of
> lipids per month.
>
> Parenteral nutrition may be either \"self-mixed\" (i.e., the patient
> is taught to prepare the nutrient solution aseptically) or
> \"pre-mixed\" (i.e., the nutrient solution is prepared by trained
> professionals employed or contracted by the PEN supplier). The
> attending physician must provide information to justify the reason for
> \"pre-mixed\" parenteral nutrient solutions.
>
> Renal dialysis patients sometimes undergo parenteral therapy to
> replace fluids and nutrients lost during dialysis. Patients are
> usually infused less than daily and parenteral feeding is often
> supplemental and, therefore, not covered as a PEN benefit. The renal
> dialysis patient must meet all the requirements for PEN coverage. The
> attending physician must document that the patient, despite the need
> for renal dialysis, suffers from a permanently impaired functional
> impairment that precludes swallowing or absorption of nutrients.
>
> For the enteral patient, the attending physician must include the
> following information on the CMN:

-   The name of the nutrient product or nutrient category,

-   The number of calories per day (100 calories = 1 unit),

-   The frequency per day,

-   The method of administration (i.e., syringe, gravity, or pump),

-   The route of administration (i.e., nasogastric tube, gastrostomy
    > tube, jejunostomy tube, percutaneous enteral gastrostomy tube, or
    > naso-intestinal tube), and

-   The reason for the use of a pump.

> Categories of enteral nutrition are based on the composition and
> source of ingredients in each enteral nutrient product. Category IB of
> enteral nutrients contains products that are natural intact
> protein/protein isolates commonly known as blenderized nutrients.
>
> Additional documentation is required to justify the necessity of
> Category IB nutrients. The attending physician must provide sufficient
> information to indicate that the patient:

-   Has an intolerance to nutritionally equivalent (semi-synthetic)
    > products;

-   Had a severe allergic reaction to a nutritionally equivalent
    (semi-synthetic) product; or

-   Was changed to a blenderized nutrient to alleviate adverse symptoms
    > expected to be of permanent duration with continued use of
    > semi-synthetic products.

> Enteral nutrient categories III through VI require additional medical
> justification for coverage. These categories represent formulas for
> special needs or use.

-   Category III (code B4153): hydrolyzed protein/amino acids. These
    > products contain a high nitrogen availability as a result of
    > chemical treatment to reduce high molecular protein compounds into
    > smaller molecules and amino acids that are easier to digest.

-   Category IV (code B4154): defined formulas for special metabolic
    > needs and conditions such as abnormal glucose tolerance, renal
    > disease, liver disease, HIV, respiratory insufficiency, and
    > malnutrition.

-   Category V (code B4155): modular components (proteins,
    > carbohydrates, fats).

-   Category VI (code B4156): standardized nutrients. These products
    > contain low residue ingredients.

> If the patient exhibits a problem with any particular formula in
> Nutrient Category I (HCPCS B4150) or II (HCPCS B4152), the physician
> must document the unfavorable events that resulted in prescribing a
> higher category formula.
>
> Generally, daily enteral intake of 750 to 2,000 calories is considered
> sufficient to maintain body weight. Patients with medical
> complications may require an intake outside the range. The attending
> physician must document the reason for prescribing less than 750
> calories per day or more than 2000 calories per day.
>
> Enteral nutrition may be administered by syringe, gravity, or pump.
> The attending physician must specify the reason that necessitates the
> use of an enteral feeding pump. Some enteral patients may experience
> complications associated with syringe or gravity method of
> administration. DME MACs provide coverage for enteral pumps if the
> medical necessity is documented by the attending physician on the CMN.
> Examples of circumstances that indicate the need for a pump include,
> but are not limited to:

-   Aspiration or Dumping Syndrome;

-   Severe diarrhea remedied by regulated feeding;

-   Insulin-dependent diabetics who require a flow rate of less than
    100cc\'s per hour for proper regulation of nutrients;

-   Patients with congestive heart failure who require a pump to prevent
    > circulatory overload; or

-   Patients with a jejunostomy tube for feeding.

> The DME MAC reviews the claims to ensure that the equipment for which
> payment is claimed is consistent with that prescribed (e.g., expect a
> claim for an I.V. pole, if a pump is used).

5.  Attending Physician\'s Signature and Identification - A handwritten,
    > original signature and date must be on each certification. The
    > form must be dated to show reasonable association to the dates of
    > active PEN therapy. The full name, address, telephone number
    > (including area code), and Unique Physician Identification Number
    > (UPIN) allows the DME MAC to determine if the prescriber is
    > authorized to order Medicare services and facilitate claims
    > development.

6.  PEN Supplier\'s Identification - The PEN supplier\'s name, address,
    > telephone number, and PEN identification number must be on each
    > certification. This information allows the DME MAC to determine if
    > the supplier is authorized to provide PEN supplies and facilitate
    > claims development.

    1.  # - DME MAC Review of Initial PEN Certifications

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-4450

> In reviewing the claim and the supporting data on the CMN, the DME MAC
> compares certain items, especially pertinent dates of treatment. For
> example, the start date of PEN coverage cannot precede the date of
> physician certification. The estimated duration of therapy must be
> contained on the CMN. This information is used to verify that the test
> of permanence is met. Once coverage is established, the estimated
> length of need at the start of PEN services will determine the
> recertification schedule.
>
> The information shown on the certification must support the need for
> PEN supplies as billed. A diagnosis must show a functional impairment
> that precludes the enteral patient from swallowing and the parenteral
> patient from absorbing nutrients.

> Initial assigned claims with the following conditions are denied
> without development:

-   Inappropriate or missing diagnosis or functional impairment;

-   Estimated duration of therapy is less than 90 consecutive days;

-   Duration of therapy is not listed;

-   Supplies have not been provided;

-   Supplies were provided prior to onset date of therapy; and

-   Stamped physician\'s signature.

> Unassigned claims are developed for missing or incomplete information.

## A. Revised Certifications/Change in Prescription

> A revised certification is required when:

-   There is a change in the attending physician\'s orders in the
    > category of nutrients and/or calories prescribed;

-   There is a change by more than one liter in the daily volume of
    > parenteral solutions;

-   There is a change from home-mix to pre-mix or pre-mix to home-mix
    parenteral solutions;

-   There is a change from enteral to parenteral or parenteral to
    > enteral therapy; or

-   There is a change in the method of infusion (e.g., from gravity-fed
    > to pump-fed).

> The PEN payments are not adjusted unless a revised or renewed
> certification documents the necessity for the change. Payment levels
> for the most current certification or recertification may not be
> changed unless a prescription change is documented by a new
> recertification.
>
> The DME MAC may adjust the recertification schedule as needed.

# - Scheduling and Documenting Recertifications of Medical Necessity for Oxygen

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Recertification scheduling and documentation requirements depend on
> the date when home oxygen therapy began. DME MACs request the
> following information on all recertifications:

-   Date and results of the most recent arterial blood gas or oximetry
    > tests prior to the recertification date;

-   Name of the provider conducting the most recent arterial blood gas
    > or oximetry tests performed prior to the recertification date and
    > the conditions under which this test were conducted; and

-   Estimated length of need for oxygen (Section B on the Form CMS-484).

> DME MAC establish the schedule for recertifying the need for oxygen
> for patients beginning home oxygen therapy in accordance with the
> requirements below:

## Recertifications

> Group I: Recertification requirements are to be determined by the DME
> MAC.
>
> Group II: If oxygen test results on the initial certification were in
> Group II, according to
>
> §1834(a)(5) of the Act, recertification of all oxygen patients must be
> performed within 90 days after initial certification for all patients
> who begin coverage after January 1, 1991, with an arterial blood gas
> result at or above a partial pressure of 55 mm Hg or an arterial
> oxygen saturation percentage at or above 89. Repeat blood gas study
> must be performed between the 61^st^ - 90^th^ day of home oxygen
> therapy. Retesting is required only if a claim for oxygen therapy will
> be filed for the fourth or later months.
>
> If recertification is due, DME MACs do not pay the next month\'s claim
> if the test was not performed during the required time frame. If a
> qualifying test is not obtained between the 61st and 90th day of home
> oxygen therapy, but the patient continues to use oxygen and a test is
> obtained at a later date, DME MAC instruct suppliers to use the date
> of the repeat test as the date of service on a subsequent claim, and
> if that test meets Group II criteria, they resume payments from that
> point of time.

2.  ## New Orders - In the following situations, a new order must be obtained and kept on file by the supplier, but neither a new CMN nor a repeat blood gas study are required:

    -   If the prescribed maximum flow rate changes but remains within
        > one of the following categories: (a) less than 1 LPM, (b) 1-4
        > LPM, (c) greater than 4 LPM

    -   If the physician has initially specified a delivery system, and
        > a change is made from one type of stationary system to another
        > (i.e., concentrator, liquid, gaseous).

        1.  # - HHA Recertification for Home Oxygen Therapy

## (Rev. 2993, Effective: ASC X12 - 01-01-12, ICD-10 - Upon Implementation of ICD- 10; Implementation: ASC X12 - 08-25-14, ICD-10 - Upon Implementation of ICD- 10)

> Section
> [[1834(a)(5)]{.underline}](http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1834.htm)
> of the Act requires patients who receive home oxygen therapy and who
> at the time such services are initiated have an initial arterial blood
> gas value of 56 or higher or an initial oxygen saturation at or above
> 89 percent to be retested between 60 and 90 days after the start of
> oxygen therapy in order to continue to receive payment.
>
> HHAs must initiate the request for the retesting as promptly as
> possible because the recertification at three months must reflect the
> results of an arterial blood gas or oxygen saturation test conducted
> between the 61st and 90th day of home oxygen therapy.
>
> Payment for the fourth month of home oxygen therapy is possible only
> if the patient\'s attending physician certifies that retesting results
> establish the continuing medical necessity for the services. The
> physician must certify based on the test of the patient\'s
>
> arterial blood gas value or oxygen saturation that there is a medical
> need for the patient to continue to receive oxygen therapy.
>
> Value codes have been assigned for HHA reporting of the arterial blood
> gas and oxygen saturation. HHAs report value code 58 or 59 on every
> initial bill for home oxygen therapy and on the fourth month\'s bill.
> Information regarding the form locator numbers that correspond to
> value codes is found in Chapter 25.
>
> For patients receiving oxygen therapy, who are not under a plan of
> care (bill type 34X), HHAs obtain a physician's recertification of the
> retesting and maintain a copy in their files for verification.
>
> For patients receiving oxygen therapy, who are under a plan of care
> (bill types 32X and 33X), HHAs obtain a physician\'s recertification
> of the retesting and reflect this on Form CMS-485 or CMS-486 for
> verification.

> therapy within the specified time frames.

# - A/B MAC (HHH) or DME MAC Review of Oxygen Certifications

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> All claims with initial certifications calling for oxygen flow rates
> of more than 4 liters per minute must be reviewed before payment is
> authorized.
>
> Items Requiring Special Attention --

a.  Oxygen Delivery or Supply Prescribed - If the treating physician has
    specified the oxygen equipment to be supplied, A/B MACs (A) and
    (HHH) and DME MACs ensure that the equipment furnished is consistent
    with that prescribed.

b.  Treating Physician Identification - A/B MACs (A) and (HHH) and DME
    MACs must ensure that the CMN or Form CMS-484 has been signed by the
    treating physician. A stamped signature is unacceptable. The
    physician\'s identification number must be the Unique Physician
    Identification Number (UPIN).

    1.  # - Limitations on DME MAC Collection of Information

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B-02-031

> The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995 §44 USC 3500, et seq.
> requires that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
> approve any collections of information performed by or for the Federal
> Government unless the collection fits within exceptions for audits and
> investigations. Absent such approval, the collection violates the PRA
> and
>
> agencies may not hold the public to the requirement. Therefore, DME
> MACs must adhere to the following:

## Power operated vehicles additional documentation requirements

> A Certificate of Medical Necessity (CMN) must accompany initial claims
> for power operated vehicles (POV). Except during the course of audits
> and investigations, DME MACs must not require that additional
> documentation accompany all POV claims. DME MACs may continue
> requesting information during the course of audits and investigations
> and when developing individual claims on either a pre- or a
> post-payment basis. If DME MACs choose to conduct such investigations,
> they must follow the guidelines in the Program Integrity Manual,
> Chapter 3.

## Power wheelchair additional documentation requirements re: make and model name/number

> There must be no requirement that all claims for power wheelchairs
> include the make and model name/number of the wheelchair separate from
> the claim or the CMN.
>
> The CMN, an OMB approved information collection form, can be used to
> collect this information. Specifically, DME MACs can require that the
> make and model name/ number of the power wheelchair be included in
> Section C of the CMN. Section C requires the supplier to include a
> narrative description of the items, options and accessories ordered.

## Power wheelchair additional documentation requirements re: functional abilities

> There must be no requirement for suppliers to submit additional
> documentation to describe a beneficiary\'s medical condition and
> functional abilities when the supplier bills for a higher level of
> equipment than previously supplied.
>
> While it is appropriate to avoid paying for duplicate equipment, it is
> inappropriate to require this documentation for all claims for
> \"higher level equipment.\" DME MACs may choose to perform pre- or
> post- payment probe samples to review these types of claims
> individually in order to determine medical necessity. If DME MACs
> choose to conduct such investigations, they must follow the guidelines
> in the Program Integrity Manual, Chapter 3.

# - Pre-Discharge Delivery of DMEPOS for Fitting and Training

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> B3-3011
>
> The following are CMS policy and billing procedures regarding the
> circumstances under which a supplier may deliver durable medical
> equipment, prosthetics, and orthotics - but not supplies - to a
> beneficiary who is in an inpatient facility that does not qualify as
> the beneficiary\'s home.

# - Conditions That Must Be Met

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> In some cases, it would be appropriate for a supplier to deliver a
> medically necessary item of durable medical equipment (DME), a
> prosthetic, or an orthotic - but not supplies - to a beneficiary who
> is an inpatient in a facility that does not qualify as the
> beneficiary\'s home. The CMS will presume that the pre-discharge
> delivery of DME, a prosthetic, or an orthotic (hereafter \"item\") is
> appropriate when all the following conditions are met:

1.  The item is medically necessary for use by the beneficiary in the
    beneficiary\'s home.

2.  The item is medically necessary on the date of discharge, i.e.,
    there is a physician\'s order with a stated initial date of need
    that is no later than the date of discharge for home use.

3.  The supplier delivers the item to the beneficiary in the facility
    solely for the purpose of fitting the beneficiary for the item, or
    training the beneficiary in the use of the item, and the item is for
    subsequent use in the beneficiary\'s home.

4.  The supplier delivers the item to the beneficiary no earlier than
    two days before the day the facility discharges the beneficiary.

5.  The supplier ensures that the beneficiary takes the item home, or
    the supplier picks up the item at the facility and delivers it to
    the beneficiary\'s home on the date of discharge.

6.  The reason the supplier furnishes the item is not for the purpose of
    eliminating the facility\'s responsibility to provide an item that
    is medically necessary for the beneficiary\'s use or treatment while
    the beneficiary is in the facility. Such items are included in the
    Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) or Prospective Payment System (PPS)
    rates.

7.  The supplier does not claim payment for the item for any day prior
    to the date of discharge.

8.  The supplier does not claim payment for additional costs that the
    supplier incurs in ensuring that the item is delivered to the
    beneficiary\'s home on the date of discharge. The supplier cannot
    bill the beneficiary for redelivery.

9.  The beneficiary\'s discharge must be to a qualified place of service
    (e.g., home, custodial facility), but not to another facility (e.g.,
    inpatient or skilled nursing) that does not qualify as the
    beneficiary\'s home.

    1.  # - Date of Service for Pre-Discharge Delivery of DMEPOS

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> For DMEPOS, the general rule is that the date of service is equal to
> the date of delivery. However pre-discharge delivery of items intended
> for use upon discharge are considered provided on the date of
> discharge. The following three scenarios demonstrate both the latter
> rule (when the date of service is the date of discharge) and related
> exceptions.

1.  If the supplier leaves the item with the beneficiary two days prior
    to the date of discharge, and if the supplier, as a practical
    matter, need do nothing further to effect the delivery of the item
    to the beneficiary\'s home (because the beneficiary or a caregiver
    takes it home), then the date of discharge is deemed to be the date
    of delivery of the item. Such date must be the date of service for
    purposes of claims submission. (This is not an exception to the
    general DMEPOS rule that the date of service must be the date of
    delivery. Rather, it recognizes the supplier\'s responsibility - per
    condition five above - to ensure that the item is actually delivered
    to the beneficiary\'s home on the date of discharge.) No one may
    bill for the days prior to the date of discharge.

2.  If the supplier fits the item to the beneficiary, or trains the
    beneficiary in its use while the beneficiary is in the facility, but
    thereafter removes the item and subsequently delivers it to the
    beneficiary\'s home, then the date of service must be the date of
    actual delivery of the item, provided such date is not earlier than
    the date of discharge.

3.  If the supplier leaves the item at the facility and the beneficiary
    does not take the item home, or a third party does not send it to
    the beneficiary\'s home, or the supplier does not

> otherwise (re)deliver the item to the beneficiary\'s home on or before
> the date of discharge, the date of service must not be earlier than
> the actual date of delivery of the item, i.e., the actual date the

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

1.  A facility remains responsible for furnishing medically necessary
    items to a beneficiary for the full duration of a beneficiary\'s
    stay. The DRG and PPS rates cover such items.

2.  A facility may not delay furnishing a medically necessary item for
    the beneficiary\'s use or treatment while the beneficiary is in the
    facility. A facility may not prematurely remove a medically
    necessary item from the beneficiary\'s use or treatment on the basis
    that a supplier delivered a similar or identical item to the
    beneficiary for the purpose of fitting or training.

3.  A facility may not, through a stratagem of relying upon a supplier
    to furnish such items, improperly shift its costs for furnishing
    medically necessary items to a beneficiary who is a resident in the
    facility to Medicare Part B.

> Nevertheless, beginning two days before the beneficiary\'s discharge,
> a facility may take reasonable actions to permit a supplier to fit or
> train the beneficiary with the medically necessary item that is for
> subsequent use in the beneficiary\'s home. These actions may include
> the substitution of the supplier-furnished item, in whole or in part,
> for the facility- furnished item during the beneficiary\'s last two
> inpatient days provided the substitution is both reasonable and
> necessary for fitting or training and the item is intended for
> subsequent use at the beneficiary\'s home.

4.  For prosthetic and orthotic (P&O) items, the above restrictions
    apply to residents in a covered Part A stay. For DME, the above
    restrictions apply in a covered Part A or a Part B stay.

    1.  # - Frequency of Claims for Repetitive Services (All Providers and Suppliers)

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> HHAs include DMEPOS on bill types 32x or33x with home health visits
> bill at the freqency required for the home health. See Chapter 10 for
> home health billing requirements.
>
> Other providers and suppliers, including home health agencies billing
> the A/B MAC (HHH) on bill type 34x, submit claims on a monthly basis
> unless another policy that allows billing at a different frequency
> applies. For example suppliers may bill for more than one month\'s
> diabetic test strips.
>
> Claims are submitted in sequence where there are cases of known
> continuous periods of service over an extended period (e.g., capped
> rental equipment or therapies). When there is a break in service (e.g.
> interruption of capped rental as the result of an extensive inpatient
> stay), suppliers should continue sequential billing when the services
> resume.
>
> The purpose of these requirements is to avoid CMS operational
> expenditures, and at the same time simplify the review process

# - DME MACs Only - Appeals of Duplicate Claims

> The Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors (DME
> MACs) must afford appeal rights for the initial determination of an
> item or service only, unless the supplier is appealing whether or not
> the denied item is actually a duplicate. If a claim is denied as a
> duplicate, the DME MACs must not afford appeal rights based on
> coverage, medical necessity, pricing, or any basis on which the
> supplier can otherwise appeal. The DME MAC may only afford appeal
> rights on claims denied as duplicates if the supplier is appealing
> because the claim is not, in fact, a duplicate. If a supplier appeals
> a denied duplicate claim on the basis that the claim is not, in fact a
> duplicate, the DME MAC shall adjudicate the claim in accordance with
> all other Medicare rules and regulations.
>
> The DME MACs must use the following Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) and
> ASC X12 835 remittance messages when denying duplicate claims:

-   MSN 7.3 - This service/item is a duplicate of a previously processed
    service. No appeal rights are attached to the denial of this service

    Disregard the appeals information on this notice unless you are
    appealing whether the service is a duplicate.

# - DME MACs - Billing Procedures Related To Advanced Beneficiary Notice (ABN) Upgrades

## (Rev. 2993, Effective: ASC X12 - 01-01-12, ICD-10 - Upon Implementation of ICD- 10; Implementation: ASC X12 - 08-25-14, ICD-10 - Upon Implementation of ICD- 10)

> This section provides the DME MACs billing instructions regarding the
> use of ABNs and claims modifiers for upgrades for items of DMEPOS.
>
> Federal Regulations at 42 CFR 411.408 and Chapter 30 of this manual
> establishes the basis for a supplier to issue an ABN to a beneficiary.
> The purpose of the ABN is to inform a Medicare beneficiary, before he
> or she receives an item that Medicare will probably not pay for that
> particular item on that particular occasion. The ABN allows the
> beneficiary to make an informed consumer decision on whether to accept
> an item for which he or she may have to pay out of pocket or through
> supplementary insurance.
>
> Under existing policy, suppliers may collect from a beneficiary a
> payment amount greater than Medicare's allowed payment amount if the
> beneficiary, by signing an ABN, agrees to pay extra for a DMEPOS item
> because the beneficiary prefers an item with features or upgrades that
> are not medically necessary. This policy applies to both assigned and
> unassigned claims. When a beneficiary does not sign an ABN, a supplier
> that accepts assignment cannot hold the beneficiary liable for the
> cost of medically unnecessary equipment or upgrades unless there is
> other acceptable evidence that the beneficiary knew or could
> reasonably have been expected to know that Medicare would not pay for
> the medically unnecessary equipment or upgrades. With respect to
> unassigned claims, a signed ABN is necessary to hold the beneficiary
> liable.
>
> The instructions in this section apply to situations where the ABN is
> being used for upgrades and applies to both assigned and unassigned
> claims. An upgrade is an item with features that go beyond what is
> medically necessary. An upgrade may include an excess component. An
> excess component may be an item feature or service, which is in
> addition to, or is more extensive and/or more expensive than the item
> that is reasonable and necessary under Medicare's coverage
> requirements. When a DMEPOS supplier knows or believes that the DMEPOS
> item does or may not meet Medicare's reasonable and necessary rules
> under specific circumstances, it is the responsibility of the supplier
> to notify the beneficiary in writing via an ABN if the supplier wants
> to collect money from a beneficiary if an item is denied.
>
> When a supplier furnishes an upgraded item of DMEPOS and the supplier
> expects Medicare to reduce the level of payment based on a medical
> necessity partial denial of coverage for additional expenses
> attributable to the upgrade, the supplier must give an ABN to the
> beneficiary for signature for holding the beneficiary liable for the
> additional expense. Optional ABN forms are available at:

> Instead of using ABNs and charging beneficiaries for upgraded items,
> suppliers in certain circumstances may decide to furnish beneficiaries
> with upgraded equipment but charge the Medicare program and the
> beneficiary the same price they would charge for a non- upgraded item.
> The reason for this may be that a supplier prefers to carry only
> higher level models of medical equipment in order to reduce the costs
> of maintaining an inventory that includes a wide variety of different
> models and products. Also, a supplier may be able to reduce its costs
> for replacement parts and repairs if it includes in its inventory only

## Policy

> Suppliers are permitted to furnish upgraded DMEPOS items and to charge
> the same price to Medicare and the beneficiary that they would charge
> for a non-upgraded item. This policy allows suppliers to furnish to
> beneficiaries, at no extra costs to the Medicare program or the
> beneficiary, a DMEPOS item that exceeds what the non-upgraded item
> that Medicare considers to be medically necessary. Therefore, even
> though the beneficiary received an upgraded DMEPOS item, Medicare's
> payment and the beneficiary's coinsurance would be based on the
> Medicare allowed amount for a non- upgraded item that does not include
> features that exceed the beneficiary's medical needs.

## Billing Instructions

> When a supplier decides to furnish an upgraded DMEPOS item but to
> charge Medicare and the beneficiary for the non-upgraded item, the
> supplier must bill for the non- upgraded item rather than the item the
> supplier actually furnished. The claim must include only the charge
> and HCPCS code for the non-upgraded item. The HCPCS code for the
> non-upgraded item must be accompanied by the following modifier:

# - Billing for Inexpensive or Other Routinely Purchased DME

## (Rev.4027; Issued: 04-27-18; Effective: 10-01-18; Implementation: 10-01-18)

> This is equipment with a purchase price not exceeding \$150, or
> equipment that the Secretary determines is acquired by purchase at
> least 75 percent of the time, or equipment that is an accessory used
> in conjunction with a nebulizer, aspirator, or ventilators that are
> either continuous airway pressure devices or intermittent assist
> devices with continuous airway pressure devices. Effective October 1,
> 2015, this category also includes speech generating devices and
> accessories necessary for the effective use of speech generating
> devices. Suppliers and providers other than HHAs bill the DME MAC or,
> in the case of implanted DME only, the A/B MAC
>
> (B). HHAs bill the A/B MAC (HHH) or the DME MAC.
>
> Effective for items and services furnished after January 1, 1991,
> Medicare DME does not include seat lift chairs. Only the seat lift
> mechanism is defined under Medicare as DME. Therefore, seat lift
> coverage is limited to the seat lift mechanism. If a seat lift chair
> is provided to a beneficiary, A/B MACs (A), and (HHH), and DME MACs
> pay only for the lift mechanism portion of the chair.
>
> Some lift mechanisms are equipped with a seat that is considered an
> integral part of the lift mechanism. A/B MACs (A) and (HHH), and DME
> MACs do not pay for chairs (HCPCS code E0620) furnished on or after
> January 1, 1991. The appropriate HCPCS codes for seat lift mechanisms
> are E0627, E0628, and E0629.
>
> For TENS, suppliers and providers other than HHAs bill the DME MAC.
> HHAs bill the A/B MAC (HHH) using revenue code 0291 for the 2-month
> rental period (see §30.1.2), billing each month as a separate line
> item and revenue code 0292 for the actual purchase along with the
> appropriate HCPCS code.

# - Billing for Items Requiring Frequent and Substantial Servicing

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> A3-3629, B3-4107.8
>
> These are items such as intermittent positive pressure breathing
> (IPPB) machines and ventilators, excluding ventilators that are either
> continuous airway pressure devices or intermittent assist devices with
> continuous airway pressure devices.
>
> Suppliers and providers other than HHAs bill the DME MAC. HHAs bill
> the A/B MAC (HHH).

# - Billing for Certain Customized Items

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> A3-3629, B3-4107.8
>
> Due to their unique nature (custom fabrication, etc.), certain
> customized DME cannot be grouped together for profiling purposes.
> Claims for customized items that do not have specific HCPCS codes are
> coded as E1399 (miscellaneous DME). This includes circumstances where
> an item that has a HCPCS code is modified to the extent that neither
> the original terminology nor the terminology of another HCPCS code
> accurately describes the modified item.
>
> Suppliers and providers other than HHAs bill the A/B MAC (B) or DME
> MAC. HHAs bill their A/B MAC (HHH), using revenue code 0292 along with
> the HCPCS.

# - Billing for Capped Rental Items (Other Items of DME)

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> A3-3629, B3-4107.8
>
> These are DME items, other than oxygen and oxygen equipment, not
> covered by the above categories. Suppliers and providers other than
> HHAs bill the DME MAC. HHAs bill the A/B MACs (HHH).

# - Billing for Oxygen and Oxygen Equipment

## (Rev. 3895, Issued: 10-27-17, Effective: 04-01-18, Implementation: 04- 02-18)

> The following instructions apply to all claims from providers and
> suppliers to whom payment may be made for oxygen. The chart in
> [[§130.6.1]{.underline}](#oxygen-equipment-and-contents-billing-chart)
> indicates what is payable under which situation.

## Monthly Billing

> Fee schedule payments for stationary oxygen system rentals are all
> inclusive and represent a monthly allowance per beneficiary.
> Accordingly, a supplier must bill on a monthly basis for stationary
> oxygen equipment and contents furnished during a rental month.
>
> A portable equipment add-on is also payable when portable oxygen is
> prescribed and it is determined to be medically necessary in
> accordance with Medicare coverage requirements. The portable add-on
> must be claimed in order to be paid. (See
> [[§30.6]{.underline}](#oxygen-and-oxygen-equipment).)

## HCPCS Codes

> The HCPCS codes must be used to report the service. One month of
> service equals one unit.

## Use of Payment Modifiers and Revenue Codes for Payment Adjustments

> The monthly payment amount for stationary oxygen is subject to
> adjustment depending on the amount of oxygen prescribed (liters per
> minute (LPM)), and whether or not portable oxygen is also prescribed.
> (See [[§30.6]{.underline}.](#oxygen-and-oxygen-equipment)) HHAs
> billing the A/B MAC (HHH) for stationary equipment, supplies, or
> contents, which are not eligible for payment adjustment, bill under
> revenue code 0601. Claims must indicate the appropriate HCPCS modifier
> described below, if applicable.

-   If the prescribed amount of oxygen is less than 1 LPM, suppliers use
    > the modifier \"QE\"; HHAs use revenue code 0602. The monthly
    > payment amount for stationary oxygen is reduced by 50 percent.

-   If the prescribed amount of oxygen is greater than 4 LPM, suppliers
    > use the modifier \"QG\"; HHAs use revenue code 0603. The monthly
    > payment amount for stationary oxygen is increased by 50 percent.

-   If the prescribed amount of oxygen exceeds 4 LPM and portable oxygen
    > is prescribed, suppliers use the modifier \"QF\"; HHAs use revenue
    > code 0604. The monthly payment for stationary oxygen is increased
    > by the higher of 50 percent of the monthly stationary oxygen
    > payment amount, or, the fee schedule amount for the portable
    > oxygen add-on. (A separate monthly payment is not allowed for the
    > portable equipment.) Effective April 1, 2017, the modifier "QF"
    > must be used with both the stationary and portable oxygen
    > equipment codes.

> Effective April 1, 2017, portable oxygen "QF" modifier fee schedule
> amounts will be added to the DMEPOS fee schedule file. The portable
> oxygen "QF" fee schedule amounts will represent the higher of 1) 50
> percent of the monthly stationary oxygen payment amount or 2) the fee
> schedule amount for the portable oxygen add-on.
>
> There are three claims processing scenarios:
>
> Scenario 1 -- A claim for stationary oxygen equipment is submitted
> with the QG modifier. The history is reviewed and it is discovered
> that portable oxygen equipment was billed AND paid within the last 30
> days prior to the stationary oxygen equipment's date of service. Since
> we have already paid the portable add-on, we can't pay the volume
> adjustment add-on, therefore billing with QG modifier is inappropriate
> and the claim should be returned as unprocessable.
>
> Scenario 2 -- A claim for stationary oxygen equipment is submitted
> with the QG modifier and within 30 days, a claim for portable oxygen
> equipment is received. In this case we
>
> have already paid the volume add-on so the portable equipment add --on
> is returned as unprocessable.
>
> Scenario 3 -- A claim for stationary oxygen equipment is submitted
> with the QG modifier AND the portable oxygen equipment comes in with
> the same date of service. In this case EVERYTHING is returned as
> unprocessable due to the incorrect use of the modifier and neither is
> valid.
>
> NOTE: All these claims are being returned as unprocessable since there
> is no way for Medicare to know whether the first claim submitted was
> billed incorrectly or if the subsequent claim was billed incorrectly.
>
> Contractors shall use the following messages for claims that are
> returned as unprocessable:
>
> Group Code: CO (Contractual Obligation)
>
> CARC 4 - The procedure code is inconsistent with the modifier used or
> a required modifier is missing. Note: Refer to the 835 Healthcare
> Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 Service Payment Information
> REF), if present.
>
> RARC MA130 - Your claim contains incomplete and/or invalid
> information, and no appeal rights are afforded because the claim is
> unprocessable. Please submit a new claim with the complete/correct
> information.
>
> The following three new pricing modifiers are added to the HCPCS file
> effective April 1, 2018:
>
> QA PRESCRIBED AMOUNTS OF STATIONARY OXYGEN FOR DAYTIME USE WHILE AT
> REST AND NIGHTTIME USE DIFFER AND THE AVERAGE OF THE TWO AMOUNTS IS
> LESS THAN 1 LITER PER MINUTE (LPM)
>
> QB PRESCRIBED AMOUNTS OF STATIONARY OXYGEN FOR DAYTIME USE WHILE AT
> REST AND NIGHTTIME USE DIFFER AND THE AVERAGE OF THE TWO AMOUNTS
> EXCEEDS 4 LITERS PER MINUTE (LPM) AND PORTABLE OXYGEN IS PRESCRIBED
>
> QR PRESCRIBED AMOUNTS OF STATIONARY OXYGEN FOR DAYTIME USE WHILE AT
> REST AND NIGHTTIME USE DIFFER AND THE AVERAGE OF THE TWO AMOUNTS IS
> GREATER THAN 4 LITERS PER MINUTE (LPM)
>
> Additionally, the existing QE, QF, and QG modifiers are revised to
> clarify that the prescribed flow rate at rest is used in accordance
> with regulations at 42 CFR 414.226(e)(3). This section instructs that
> if the prescribed flow rate is different for the patient at rest than
> for the patient at exercise, the flow rate for the patient at rest is
> used. Effective April 1, 2018, the modifiers are revised to read:
>
> QE PRESCRIBED AMOUNT OF STATIONARY OXYGEN WHILE AT REST IS LESS THAN 1
> LITER PER MINUTE (LPM)
>
> QF PRESCRIBED AMOUNT OF STATIONARY OXYGEN WHILE AT REST EXCEEDS 4
> LITERS PER MINUTE (LPM) AND PORTABLE OXYGEN IS PRESCRIBED
>
> QG PRESCRIBED AMOUNT OF STATIONARY OXYGEN WHILE AT REST IS GREATER
> THAN 4 LITERS PER MINUTE (LPM)
>
> Beginning April 1, 2018, claims for monthly oxygen volume adjustments
> must indicate the appropriate HCPCS modifier described below as
> applicable. Oxygen fee schedule amounts are adjusted as follows:
>
> If the prescribed amount of oxygen is less than 1 LPM, suppliers use
> either of the following modifiers with the stationary oxygen HCPCS
> code:

-   The modifier "QE" PRESCRIBED AMOUNT OF STATIONARY OXYGEN WHILE AT
    > REST IS LESS THAN 1 LITER PER MINUTE (LPM); HHAs use

> revenue code 0602. The monthly payment amount for stationary oxygen is
> reduced by 50 percent.

-   The modifier "QA" PRESCRIBED AMOUNTS OF STATIONARY OXYGEN FOR
    > DAYTIME USE WHILE AT REST AND NIGHTIME USE DIFFER AND THE AVERAGE
    > OF THE TWO AMOUNTS IS LESS THAN 1 LITER PER

> MINUTE (LPM); The monthly payment amount for stationary oxygen is
> reduced by 50 percent. This modifier is used when the prescribed flow
> rate is different for nighttime use and daytime use and the average of
> the two flow rates is used in determining the volume adjustment.
>
> If the prescribed amount of oxygen is greater than 4 LPM, suppliers
> use either of the following modifiers with the stationary oxygen HCPCS
> code:

-   The modifier "QG" PRESCRIBED AMOUNT OF STATIONARY OXYGEN WHILE AT
    > REST IS GREATER THAN 4 LITERS PER MINUTE (LPM);

> HHAs use revenue code 0603. The monthly payment amount for stationary
> oxygen is increased by 50 percent.

-   The modifier "QR" PRESCRIBED AMOUNTS OF STATIONARY OXYGEN FOR
    > DAYTIME USE WHILE AT REST AND NIGHTIME USE DIFFER AND THE AVERAGE
    > OF THE TWO AMOUNTS IS GREATER THAN 4 LITERS

> PER MINUTE (LPM); HHAs use revenue code 0603. The monthly payment
> amount for stationary oxygen is increased by 50 percent.
>
> If the prescribed amount of oxygen is greater than 4 LPM and portable
> oxygen is prescribed, suppliers use either of the following modifiers
> with both the stationary and portable oxygen HCPCS code:

-   The modifier "QF" PRESCRIBED AMOUNT OF STATIONAY OXYGEN WHILE AT
    > REST EXCEEDS 4 LITERS PER MINUTE (LPM) AND

> PORTABLE OXYGEN IS PRESCRIBED; HHAs use revenue code 0604. If the
> prescribed flow rate differs between stationary and portable oxygen
> equipment, the flow rate for the stationary equipment is used. The
> monthly payment for stationary oxygen is increased by the higher of 50
> percent of the monthly stationary oxygen payment amount, or the fee
> schedule amount for the portable oxygen add-on. A separate monthly
> payment is not allowed for the portable equipment. Effective April 1,
> 2017, the modifier "QF" must be used with both the stationary and
> portable oxygen equipment codes.

-   The modifier "QB" PRESCRIBED AMOUNTS OF STATIONARY OXYGEN FOR
    > DAYTIME USE WHILE AT REST AND NIGHTTIME USE DIFFER AND THE AVERAGE
    > OF THE TWO AMOUNTS EXCEEDS 4 LITERS PER MINUTE (LPM) AND PORTABLE
    > OXYGEN IS PRESCRIBED; HHAs use

> revenue code 0604. If the prescribed flow rate differs between
> stationary and portable oxygen equipment, the flow rate for the
> stationary equipment is used. The monthly payment for stationary
> oxygen is increased by the higher of 50 percent of the monthly
> stationary payment amount, or the fee schedule amount for the portable
> oxygen add-on. A separate monthly payment is not allowed for the
> portable equipment. Effective April 1, 2018, the modifier "Q??" must
> be used with both the stationary and portable oxygen equipment codes.
> The stationary and portable oxygen equipment QB fee schedule amounts
> will be added to the DMEPOS fee schedule file effective 4/1/2018.
>
> The stationary oxygen QF and QB fee schedule amounts on the DMEPOS fee
> schedule file represent 100 percent of the stationary oxygen allowed
> fee schedule amount. The portable oxygen equipment add-on QF and QB
> fee schedule amount on the file by state represent the higher of:

1.  50 percent of the monthly stationary oxygen payment amount (codes
    > E0424, E0439, E1390 or E1391); or

2.  The fee schedule amount for the portable oxygen add-on (codes E0431,
    E0433, E0434, E1392 or K0738).

## Conserving Device Modifier

> The HHA\'s and suppliers must indicate if an oxygen conserving device
> is being used with an oxygen delivery system by using HCPCS modifier
> "QH".

## DME MACs Only

> For all States that have licensure/certification requirements for the
> provision of oxygen and/or oxygen related products, DME MACs shall
> process claims for oxygen and oxygen related products only when an
> oxygen specialty code is assigned to the DMEPOS supplier by the NSC
> and is forwarded to the DME MACs from the NSC.
>
> This specialty shall be licensed and/or certified by the State when
> applicable. This specialty shall bill for Medicare-covered services
> and/or products when State law permits such entity to furnish oxygen
> and/or oxygen related products.

# - Billing for Maintenance and Servicing (Providers and Suppliers)

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> A3-3629
>
> General
>
> Payment is not made for maintenance and servicing if the beneficiary
> rents the equipment since payment for maintenance and servicing are
> included in the rental payments. An exception to this is the 6-month
> service fee for capped rental items that the beneficiary has elected
> not to purchase (see
> [[§40.2]{.underline}](#maintenance-and-service-of-capped-rental-items)
> and
> [[130.5]{.underline}](#billing-for-capped-rental-items-other-items-of-dme)).
>
> Where purchase is permitted (including \"Capped Rental Items\" and
> where the beneficiary elects to purchase), payment for reasonable and
> necessary maintenance and servicing is made for such purchased
> equipment.
>
> Coding to Identify Maintenance and Servicing Capped Rental
>
> If the service is capped rental, suppliers that bill the DME MAC for
> the maintenance and servicing fee (see
> [[§40.2]{.underline}](#maintenance-and-service-of-capped-rental-items))
> use modifier -MS with the HCPCS code for the equipment to show that
> parts and labor which are not covered under any manufacturer or
> supplier warranty.
>
> The HHAs that bill the A/B MAC (HHH) for maintenance and servicing of
> capped rental items use revenue code 0299 along with the appropriate
> HCPCS code for the equipment.
>
> Not Capped Rental
>
> Suppliers that bill the DME MACs for maintenance and servicing
> indicate the HCPCS code of the item serviced and the modifier -RP,
> replacement or repair.
>
> The HHAs that bill A/B MACs (HHH) for maintenance and servicing use
> revenue code 0299 and the appropriate HCPCS code for the equipment
> serviced.
>
> Hospitals report revenue code 0274 along with one of the following
> HCPCS codes: L4205, L4210, L7500, L7510, or L7520 when billing the A/B
> MAC (A) for maintenance and servicing of prosthetics and orthotics.

# - Installment Payments

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> A3-3629
>
> Where a beneficiary is purchasing an item through installments, the
> total price of the equipment item is reported on the first bill.
> Monthly payments are made (by the A/B MAC (A), (B), (HHH), or DME
> MAC). The monthly amount is equivalent to the rental fee schedule
> amount and is paid until the fee schedule purchase price or actual
> charge has been reached, whichever comes first.

# - Showing Whether Rented or Purchased

> (Rev. 4052, Issued: 05-17-18, Effective: 10-01-18, Implementation:
> 10-01-18**)**

+--------------------------------------------------------------+-------+
| Claims must specify whether equipment is rented or           | > S   |
| purchased. For purchased equipment, the itemized bill or     | tatus |
| claim must also indicate whether equipment is new or used.   |       |
| If the provider or supplier fails to indicate on an assigned |       |
| claim whether equipment was new or used, the MAC processing  |       |
| the claims assumes purchased equipment is used and process   |       |
| the claim accordingly, i.e., they pay on the basis of the    |       |
| used purchase fee. If an unassigned purchase claim does not  |       |
| specify whether the item was new or used, MACs develop the   |       |
| claim with the supplier. The                                 |       |

> Medical supplies are items that, due to their therapeutic or
> diagnostic characteristics, are essential in enabling personnel to
> carry out effectively the care the physician has ordered for the
> treatment or diagnosis of the patient\'s illness or injury. Medical
> supplies fit into two categories. They are classified as:

-   Routine because they are used in small quantities for patients
    > during the usual course of most home visits; or

-   Nonroutine because they are needed to treat a patient\'s specific
    > illness or injury in accordance with the physician\'s plan of care
    > and meet further conditions discussed in more detail below.

> Both routine and non-routine medical supplies are included in the home
> health PPS rate and are not separately payable if the beneficiary is
> under a home health plan of care. The CMS publishes a list of these
> medical supplies annually, identified by HCPCS code. If no home health
> plan of care is in place, non-routine medical supplies are reported

# 190 - A/B MAC (A), (B), or (HHH), or DME MAC Application of Fee Schedule and Determination of Payments and Patient Liability for DME Claims

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) A3-3629, B3-5102

> The following instructions apply to all A/B MACs (A), (B), and (HHH),
> and DME MACs processing DMEPOS claims:
>
> First the \'allowable amount\' is determined. This is the lower of the
> fee schedule amount or the billed charge.
>
> The application of deductible and coinsurance are calculated as
> follows.

## Claims to A/B MACs (B) or DME MACs

> Any unmet deductible is subtracted from the allowed amount and 80
> percent of the remainder is paid.

## Claims to A/B MACs (A) or (HHH)

> **NOTE:** Per [[42 CFR
> 410.2]{.underline}](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collectionCfr.action?collectionCode=CFR&searchPath=Title%2B42/Chapter%2BIV/Subchapter%2BB/Part%2B413&oldPath=Title%2B42/Chapter%2BIV/Subchapter%2BB/Part%2B412&isCollapsed=true&selectedYearFrom=2013&ycord=2479)
> (Follow the link, choose the applicable year, select Title 42, then
> open Chapter IV. You then must choose which part to open. To get to
> §410.2 you select the second choice and open it, then select Part 410
> and download the pdf version.), a nominal charge provider means a
> provider that furnishes services free of charge or at a nominal
> charge, and is either a public provider or another provider that (1)
> demonstrates to CMS\'s satisfaction that a significant portion of its
> patients are low-income; and (2) requests that payment for its
> services be determined accordingly.

## Payment to a Provider Other Than Nominal Charge Provider

> To determine the Part B payment to a provider other than nominal
> charge provider, A/B MACs (A) and (HHH) subtract any unmet Part B
> deductible from the lower of the actual charge or the fee schedule
> amount for the item or service and multiply the remainder by 80
> percent. This is the final payment. (If the item or service is
> furnished by a HHA and is covered under a plan of care, the payment is
> determined in the same way, except that no deductible is applicable.)

## Payment to a Nominal Charge HHA

> To determine the Part B payment to a nominal charge HHA, A/B MACs
> (HHH) subtract any unmet Part B deductible from the fee schedule
> amount and multiply the remainder by 80 percent. This is the final
> payment. (If the item or service is covered under a plan of care, the
> payment is determined in the same way, except that no deductible is
> applicable.) For these items and services, no providers other than
> HHAs are considered nominal charge providers.

## Payment to a Nominal Charge Provider Other Than a Nominal Charge HHA

> To determine the Part B payment to a nominal charge provider other
> than a nominal charge HHA, A/B MACs (A) and (HHH) subtract any unmet
> Part B deductible from the lower of the actual charge or the fee
> schedule amount and multiply the remainder by 80 percent. This is the
> final payment.

## Patient Liability to a HHA Other Than a Nominal Charge HHA

> To determine the patient liability to a HHA other than a nominal
> charge HHA under Part B, A/B MACs (HHH) subtract any unmet deductible
> from the lower of the actual charge or fee schedule amount and
> multiply the remainder by 20 percent. The result, plus the unmet
> deductible is the patient\'s liability. If the item or service is
> covered under a plan of care, the deductible does not apply.

## Patient Liability to a Nominal Charge HHA

> To determine patient liability to a nominal charge HHA under Part B,
> A/B MACs (HHH) subtract any unmet deductible from the fee schedule
> amount and multiply the remainder by 20 percent. The result, plus the
> unmet deductible is the patient\'s liability. If the item or service
> is covered under a Plan of Care, the deductible does not apply.

## Patient Liability to a Provider Other Than a HHA

> To determine patient liability to a provider other than an HHA
> (including nominal charge providers other than a HHA), A/B MACs (A)
> subtract any unmet deductible from the actual charge and multiply the
> remainder by 20 percent. The result, plus the unmet deductible is the
> patient\'s liability. Coinsurance is applied as applicable.
>
> The following describes application of deductible and coinsurance on
> HHA bills by bill type:

a.  Patient Under Part B Plan of Treatment (Bill Type 32X)

    -   No deductible applicable; and

    -   No coinsurance applicable

> **Exception:** Coinsurance applies on DME and orthotic/prosthetic
> claims.

b.  Patient Under Part A Plan of Treatment (Bill Type 33X)

    -   No deductible applicable; and

    -   No coinsurance applicable

> **Exception:** Coinsurance applies on DME and orthotic/prosthetic
> claims.

c.  Patient Not Under Plan of Treatment, Part B Medical and Other Health
    > Services and Osteoporosis Injections (Bill Type 34X)

    -   Deductible applies; and

    -   Coinsurance applies

> The following examples illustrate how to calculate provider payment
> and patient liability in various situations. The examples, like the
> preceding rules for HHAs, address items and services not under a Plan
> of Care and, therefore, include deductible application. The Note
> following each HHA example addresses items and services obtained under
> a Plan of Care and, therefore, do not address deductible application.
>
> **EXAMPLE 1:** CLAIM CONTAINING ONLY ORTHOTIC/PROSTHETIC CHARGES

> \$200.00 Orthotic/prosthetic charges
>
> \$140.00 Orthotic/prosthetic fee schedule amount

# 200 - Automatic Mailing/Delivery of DMEPOS

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Suppliers/manufacturers may not automatically deliver DMEPOS to
> beneficiaries unless the beneficiary, physician, or designated
> representative has requested additional supplies/equipment. The reason
> is to assure that the beneficiary actually needs the DMEPOS. DME MAC
> review should be done on a post-pay basis.
>
> A beneficiary or their caregiver must specifically request refills of
> repetitive services and/or supplies before a supplier dispenses them.
> A supplier may not initiate a refill of an order. The supplier must
> not automatically dispense a quantity of supplies on a predetermined
> regular basis.
>
> A request for refill is different than a request for a renewal of a
> prescription. Generally, the beneficiary or caregiver will rarely keep
> track of the end date of a prescription.
>
> Furthermore the physician is not likely to keep track of this. The
> supplier is the one who will need to have the order on file and will
> know when the prescription will run out and a new order is needed. It
> is reasonable to expect the supplier to contact the physician and ask
> for a renewal of the order. This is consistent with the DME MAC
> Supplier Manual for the particular jurisdiction, which states: \"The
> description of the item (on an order) may be completed by someone
> other than the physician (most commonly the supplier).
>
> However, the physician must review the order and sign and date it to
> indicate agreement.\" Again the supplier must not automatically mail
> or deliver the DMEPOS to the beneficiary until specifically requested.
>
> The DME MACs inform suppliers of these procedures via their bulletins
> and training sessions. These procedures will benefit suppliers by
> helping to maximize claims processing accuracy, and to reduce the
> likelihood of a postpayment claim denial because the DMEPOS were not
> medically necessary.
>
> DME MACs must publish this information on their Web sites and in their
> bulletins on an annual basis.

# - CWF Crossover Editing for DMEPOS Claims During an Inpatient Stay

> **(Rev. 2993, Effective: ASC X12 - 01-01-12, ICD-10 - Upon
> Implementation of ICD- 10; Implementation: ASC X12 - 08-25-14,
> ICD-10 - Upon Implementation of ICD- 10)**
>
> **I. General Information**

A.  **Background:**

> In general, the DMEPOS benefit is meant only for items a beneficiary
> is using in his or her home. For a beneficiary in a Part A inpatient
> stay, an institutional provider (e.g., hospital) is not defined as a
> beneficiary's home for DMEPOS, and so Medicare does not make separate
> payment for DMEPOS when a beneficiary is in the institution. The
> institution is expected to provide all medically necessary DMEPOS
> during a beneficiary's covered Part A stay.
>
> **EXCEPTION:** Medicare makes a separate payment for a full month for
> DMEPOS items, provided the beneficiary was in the home on the "from"
> date or anniversary date defined below.
>
> For capped rental items of durable medical equipment (DME) where the
> DME supplier submits a monthly bill, the date of delivery ("from"
> date) on the first claim must be the "from" or anniversary date on all
> subsequent claims for the item. For example, if the first claim for a
> wheelchair is dated September 15, all subsequent bills must be dated
> for the 15th of the following months (October 15, November 15, etc.).

## Policy:

> If a beneficiary using DMEPOS is at home on the "from" date or
> anniversary date, Medicare pays for the DMEPOS for the entire month,
> even if the "from" date is the date of discharge from the
> institutional provider.
>
> If a beneficiary using DMEPOS is in a covered Part A stay for a full
> month, Medicare does not make payment for the DMEPOS for that month.
>
> For capped rental items, if the covered Part A stay overlaps the
> anniversary date ("from" date on the claim), and the beneficiary is
> not in the covered Part A stay for the entire month, the date of
> discharge becomes the new anniversary date ("from" date on the claim)
> for subsequent claims. In this situation, the supplier must submit a
> new claim with the date of discharge as the new anniversary date upon
> the beneficiary's release from the institution. Suppliers should
> annotate the claims, to indicate that the patient was in an
> institution, resulting in the need to establish a new anniversary
> date.
>
> The CWF:

-   rejects a DME MAC claim that contain DMEPOS HCPCS codes when the DME
    MAC claim has a date of service that falls within the inpatient
    stay;

-   considers an inpatient stay to include all days prior to the date of
    discharge;

-   processes a DME MAC claim that contain DMEPOS HCPCS codes when the
    DME MAC claim has the same "from" date equal to the date of
    inpatient discharge;

-   validates for a crossover service on a DME MAC claim for an
    inpatient beneficiary based on the "from" date only of the DME MAC
    claim;

-   identifies a DME MAC claim for maintenance and servicing by the "MS"
    modifier; and

-   allows payment for a DME MAC claim for maintenance and servicing of
    capped rental items when a claim contains the "MS" modifier.

> The CWF approves to pay maintenance and servicing claims regardless of
> whether the beneficiary is in an institutional setting or in the home
> environment.
>
> The changes in the general policy apply to all items of DMEPOS paid by
> the DME MACs, however, changes in anniversary date billing apply only
> to capped rental DME.
>
> In cases where the anniversary date falls at the end of the month (for
> example January 31) and a subsequent month does not have a day with
> the same date (for example, February), the DME MAC uses the final date
> in the calendar month (for example, February 28).

## EXAMPLE 1:

> A beneficiary rents a wheelchair beginning on January 1. The DME MAC
> determines that the wheelchair is medically necessary and that the
> beneficiary meets all coverage criteria, and so begins to make payment
> on the wheelchair. The beneficiary enters a covered a hospital on
> February 15 and is discharged on April 5.
>
> In this example, Medicare pays for the entire month of February,
> because the patient was in the home for part of the month. However,
> the DME MAC denies the claim for March, because the patient was in a
> covered hospital stay for the entire month.
>
> Because the anniversary date ("from" date) of the monthly bill was
> April 1, and the patient was still in the covered hospital stay on
> that date, the DME supplier must not submit another claim until April

## EXAMPLE 2:

> A beneficiary receives oxygen on January 1. On February 28, the
> patient enters a hospital and is discharged on March 15.

## EXAMPLE 3:

> A beneficiary rents a hospital bed beginning on January 1. On March
> 15, the patient enters a hospital and is discharged on March 25.
>
> In this example, the DME MAC pays for the entire month of March.

## EXAMPLE 4:

> A beneficiary rents a wheelchair beginning December 15. On January 1,
> the patient enters a hospital and is discharged on January 31.
>
> In this example, the DME MAC denies the claim dated January 15. The

# - SNF Consolidated Billing and DME Provided by DMEPOS Suppliers

> **(Rev. 222, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not
> Applicable)**

# - General Information

## (Rev. 222, Issued: 07-02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable)

> The Social Security Act (§1861(n)) specifies that a hospital or a
> skilled nursing facility (SNF) cannot be considered a patient's "home"
> for purposes of the DME benefit. (This
>
> restriction of coverage to only those items that are furnished for use
> in the patient's home [does not]{.underline} [apply]{.underline} to
> coverage under the separate Part B benefits for Prosthetics,
> Orthotics, and Supplies, which are payable without regard to the
> particular setting in which they are furnished.)
>
> When DME is furnished for use in a SNF during a [covered Part A
> stay]{.underline}, the DME MACs shall not make separate payment for
> DME, since the DME is already included in the payment that the SNF
> receives for the covered stay itself. When DME is furnished for use in
> a SNF during a [noncovered stay]{.underline} (SNF benefits exhausted,
> no qualifying 3-day hospital stay, etc.), the DME MACs still shall not
> make separate payment for DME, as explained above, Part B's DME
> benefit does not cover DME items that are furnished for use in SNFs.
> Even if a patient already rents or owns a piece of DME in their home,
> the SNF cannot require the patient to bring their own rented or
> purchased DME with them into the SNF.

# - Partial Month Stays For Capped Rental Equipment

## (Rev. 2993, Effective: ASC X12 - 01-01-12, ICD-10 - Upon Implementation of ICD- 10; Implementation: ASC X12 - 08-25-14, ICD-10 - Upon Implementation of ICD- 10)

A.  **General Rule**

> For capped rental DME items where the DME supplier submits a monthly
> bill, the date of delivery (the "from" date) on the first claim must
> be the "from", or "anniversary date", on all subsequent claims for the
> item. For example, if the first claim for a wheelchair is dated
> September 15, all subsequent bills must be dated on the 15^th^ of the
> following months (October 15, November 15, etc.).
>
> The following instructions discuss DME payment when the DME is
> furnished during a month in which the beneficiary spends part of the
> month in a SNF, and part of the month in his or her own home. In
> accordance with DME payment policy, Medicare will make separate
> payment for a full month for DME items in such situations, provided
> the beneficiary was in the home on the "from" date or "anniversary
> date" defined above.

## Policy

> If a beneficiary using DME is at home on the "from" or "anniversary
> date", Medicare will make payment for DME for the entire month, even
> if the "from" date is the date of discharge from the SNF.
>
> If a beneficiary using DME is in a covered Part A stay in a SNF for a
> full month, Medicare will not make payment for DME for that month.
>
> For capped rental items, if the covered Part A SNF stay overlaps the
> "from" or "anniversary date" of the Certificate of Medical Necessity
> (CMN), and the beneficiary is not in the covered Part A SNF stay for
> the entire month, the date of discharge becomes the new "anniversary
> date" for subsequent claims. In this situation, the supplier must
>
> submit a new claim with the date of discharge as the new anniversary
> date upon the beneficiary's release from the SNF. Suppliers should
> annotate claims, to indicate that the patient was in a SNF, resulting
> in the need to establish a new anniversary date.
>
> **NOTES:** The DME MACs must continue to make payment for maintenance
> and servicing of capped rental items regardless of whether the
> beneficiary is in a covered Part A SNF stay on the date of service of
> the maintenance and servicing claim.
>
> The DME MACs must make payment for DME on the date of discharge from a
> covered Part A SNF stay. Claims must edit based on the "from" date of
> the claim and not the "through" date of the claim.

## EXAMPLE 1:

> A beneficiary rents a wheelchair beginning on January 1. The DME MAC
> determines that the wheelchair is medically necessary and that the
> beneficiary meets all coverage criteria, and so begins to make payment
> on the wheelchair. The beneficiary enters a covered Part A stay in a
> SNF on February 15 and is discharged on April 5. In this example,
> Medicare will make payment for the entire month of February, because
> the patient was in the home for part of the month. However, the DME
> MAC will deny the claim for March, because the patient was in a
> covered Part A stay in the SNF for the entire month.
>
> Because the anniversary date ("from" date) of the monthly bill was
> April 1, and the patient was still in the covered Part A stay in a SNF
> on that date, the DME supplier must not submit another claim until
> April 5 (the date of discharge). April 5 becomes the new anniversary
> date ("from" date) for billing purposes, so the supplier would now
> bill on the 5^th^ of the month rather than the 1^st^ of the month for
> the remainder of the capped rental period. The supplier should
> annotate the claim to indicate that the patient was in a SNF on the
> first claim with the new anniversary date.

## EXAMPLE 2:

> A beneficiary receives oxygen on January 1. On February 28, the
> patient enters a covered Part A stay in a SNF and is discharged on
> March 15.
>
> In this example, the DME MAC would deny a claim dated March 1. The
> supplier would submit a new claim dated March 15, which would then
> become the anniversary date for billing purposes. The supplier should
> annotate the claim to indicate that the patient was in a covered Part
> A stay in a SNF on the first claim with the new anniversary date.

## EXAMPLE 3:

> A beneficiary rents a hospital bed beginning on January 1. On March
> 15, the patient enters a covered Part A stay in a SNF and is
> discharged on March 25.
>
> In this example, the DME MAC will make payment for the entire month of
> March.
>
> **NOTE:** The changes in the general policy in this instruction apply
> to all items of DME paid by the DME MACs. However, changes in
> "anniversary date" billing requirements only apply to capped rental
> DME.

# - Home Health Consolidated Billing and Supplies Provided by DMEPOS Suppliers

## (Rev. 2977, Issued; 06-20-14, Effective: 09-23-14; ICD-10: Upon Implementation of ICD-10, Implementation: 09-23-14; ICD-10: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

> Section 1842 (b)(6)(F) of the Social Security Act requires
> consolidated billing of all home health services while a beneficiary
> is under a home health plan of care authorized by a physician.
> Consequently, Medicare makes payment for all such items and services
> to a single home health agency (HHA) overseeing that plan.
>
> The law states payment will be made to the HHA without regard as to
> whether or not the item or service was furnished by the agency, by
> others under arrangement to the HHA, or when any other contracting or
> consulting arrangements exist with the primary HHA, or "otherwise."
> Payment for all items is included in the home health prospective
> payment system (HH PPS) episode payment the HHA receives.
>
> Nonroutine medical supplies are among the types of services that are
> subject to the home health consolidated billing provision. Medicare
> periodically publishes Recurring Update Notifications that contain
> updated lists of nonroutine supply codes that must be included in home
> health consolidated billing. These services may not be billed
> separately by a DMEPOS supplier when a Medicare beneficiary is in a HH
> PPS episode of care.
>
> Durable Medical Equipment (DME), including prosthetics, orthotics and
> oxygen, is exempt from home health consolidated billing by law.
>
> For detailed information regarding home health consolidated billing,
> DMEPOS suppliers should refer to chapter 10, section 20 of this
> manual.
