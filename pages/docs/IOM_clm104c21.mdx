# - General Medicare Summary Notices (MSN) Requirements

> **(Rev. 955, Issued: 05-19-06, Effective: MCS-June 12, 2006, VMS-July
> 1, 2006, FISS-**
>
> **September 1, 2006, Implementation: MCS-June 12, 2006, VMS-July 3,
> 2006, FISS-**
>
> **September 1, 2006)**
>
> Effective July 1, 2002, the MSN is used by all A/B MACs (A), (B),
> (HHH), and DME MACs.
>
> The MSN is the primary vehicle by which beneficiaries are notified of
> decisions on their claims for Medicare benefits. The A/B MAC (A), (B),
> (HHH), or DME MAC mails a single MSN at the end of the month to each
> beneficiary for whom claim was processed during the month to inform
> the beneficiary of the disposition of all claims. All MACs shall issue
> No-Pay MSNs on a quarterly/90 day mailing cycle. MSNs with checks to
> the beneficiary will continue to be mailed out as processed. To ensure
> that all messages are uniform throughout the Medicare program, A/B
> MACs (A), (B), (HHH), and DME MACs may not use locally developed MSN
> messages until approved by the regional office (RO).
>
> The MSNs are not sent to providers. Providers receive remittance
> advice records. (See Chapter 22 for instructions about the provider
> remittance record.)
>
> The MSN contains the following sections or areas:

-   Disclaimer;

-   Title;

-   Claims Information;

-   Message; and

-   Appeals.

> Detailed requirements for completion of each section are included in
> [[§10.3]{.underline}.](#ab-mac-a-b-hhh-or-dme-mac-instructions-for-preparing-the-msn)
> Generally, A/B MAC (A), (B), (HHH), or DME MAC requirements are the
> same. Where there are differences or where the specific specification
> applies to only the A/B MAC (B)/DME MAC or to only the A/B MAC
> (A)/(HHH), the difference is noted in the specific instruction.
>
> Although every attempt has been made to make the MSN as simple as
> possible, the MSN is sufficiently complex that MACs must maintain
> continuing training efforts directed at beneficiaries and providers
> for understanding and interpretation of data on the MSN. Although
> providers are not mailed copies of MSNs, beneficiaries frequently show
> MSNs to providers to establish deductible status for provider billing.

# - General Requirements for the MSN

> **(Rev. 1491, Issued: 04-11-08, Effective: 05-12-08, Implementation:
> 05-12-08)**

## A/B MAC (A)/(HHH) MSN

> The MSN is used to notify Medicare beneficiaries of action taken on
> A/B MAC (A)/(HHH) processed claims. MSNs are not used by A/B MACs
> (HHH) for RAPs, and RAP data are not included on the monthly MSN.
>
> The MSN provides the beneficiary with a record of services received
> and the status of any deductibles. The MSN also informs the
> beneficiary of appeal rights. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires
> all Part A benefit notices to include the amount of Medicare payment
> for each service. A/B MACs (A) and (HHH), must furnish an MSN to all
> beneficiaries for whom claims are filed during the month unless the
> situation is specifically excluded by other manual instructions. MACs
> shall issue No-Pay MSNs on a quarterly/90 day mailing cycle. MSNs with
> a payment check to the beneficiary shall continue to be mailed out as
> processed. No-pay MSNs are defined as those MSNs which do not require
> payment to the beneficiary for the respective claim(s).
>
> The MSN replaced the following documents:

-   Form CMS-1533, Part A Medicare Benefit Notice, also known as the
    > Part A Notice of Utilization (NOU) sent for inpatient services;

-   Form CMS-1954, Benefit Denial Letter (BDL), sent for partially
    > denied claims; and

-   Form CMS-1955, BDL sent for totally denied claims.

> Since CMS eliminated BDLs, Medicare beneficiaries receive the
> information previously conveyed on BDLs through narrative messages
> contained on the MSN. Providers no longer receive a separate written
> notification or copy of the BDL. Providers must utilize the coding
> information (e.g., ANSI Reason Codes) conveyed on the financial
> remittance advice to ascertain reasons associated with Medicare claims
> determinations affecting payment and applicable appeal rights and/or
> appeals information.

## A/B MAC (B)/DME MAC MSN

> The MSN is used to notify Medicare beneficiaries of action taken on
> their processed claims. The MSN provides the beneficiary with a record
> of services received and the status of any deductibles. The MSN also
> informs the beneficiary of appeal rights.

# - Correction/Reissuance of Faulty MSNs

### (Rev. 159, 04-30-04)

> Occasionally programming errors will occur which cause inaccuracies on
> MSNs that do not materially affect benefits. An example of a potential
> programming error could be one data column writing in another data
> column. So long as the claims are correctly paid and the notice is
> intelligible, it is not necessary to identify the impacted MSNs or
> reissue them. The resources to identify and reissue all of the
> documents would not be justified.
>
> In situations where MACs feel reissuance is absolutely necessary, they
> must work with their regional office to identify costs involved before
> proceeding. When such problems occur, MACs must take actions that will
> inform beneficiaries of the situation. These actions should fall
> within the framework of routine operations. Such actions include, but
> are not limited to, fielding calls from beneficiaries and alerting
> customer service representatives of the situation and posting an alert
> on MACs' Web sites. While not all of these solutions may be possible,
> MACs should take the most appropriate steps to best mitigate the
> potential confusion, but not incur special costs. Any communication
> regarding this type of situation should convey that it was a temporary
> programming error, which has been fixed, and is believed not to have
> affected the beneficiary's benefits.
>
> A beneficiary may call the MAC to request a copy of the MSN with the
> correct information. In such cases, the MAC will provide one.

# - Basic Concepts and Approaches

### (Rev. 3210, Issued: 03-03-15, Effective: 04-16-15. Implementation: 04-16-15)

A.  **Overview**

> The Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) is a printed notification, sent to
> Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Original Medicare, that displays
> data for claims processed during a given reporting period. The MSN
> lists claim information in a summarized format. It also contains other
> helpful information for beneficiaries. Each MSN consists of the
> following four sections:

## SECTION 1: SUMMARY (PAGE 1)

> A one-page summary of the beneficiary's Medicare status and of the
> claims' data on the notice.

## SECTION 2: MAKING THE MOST OF YOUR MEDICARE (PAGE 2)

> One page with tips for beneficiaries on how to use their MSN, get help
> with Medicare issues, and learn more about Medicare services.

## SECTION 3: CLAIMS (PAGE 3 - X)

> A section, which may extend over multiple pages, listing the
> beneficiary claims submitted to Medicare over the period of the
> notice.

## SECTION 4: DENIALS & APPEALS (LAST PAGE)

> One page containing details on beneficiaries' appeals rights and, more
> generally, on how they can get help with denied claims.
>
> Layout and content specifications for these sections begin at §10.3.4.
> Specifications address the position, formatting, content, and (if
> applicable) rules for dynamic content in individual subsections of
> each section.

### Claim Types: The 'Extended Family' of MSNs

> Medicare claims are processed and paid under a range of different
> systems. (In addition, different claim types may be processed and
> printed by separate MACs.) While the overall appearance and format of
> all MSNs is consistent, different claim types do require some
> variations in the notice, in both the type of content supplied and the
> specific language used.
>
> This document identifies eight **primary claim types** in the
> "extended family" of MSNs:
>
> GLOBAL NOTICE: This file version does not include specifications for
> Part A claims for inpatient mental health care in a psychiatric
> hospital. The instructions for these claims will be included in a
> subsequent version.

-   ### Part A Inpatient

> Claims for inpatient hospital services and skilled-nursing facility
> services.

-   ### 'B of A'

> Claims for outpatient services provided by medical facilities; these
> claims are paid under the Part B program, but their claim data is
> presented in a format similar to Part A Inpatient claims.

-   ### Hospice

> Claims for hospice care, which are paid for under Part A but require a
> claim format more similar to Part B claims.

-   ### Home Health

> Claims for home-health services that are paid under Part A or Part B.
> These MSNs also require a claim format more similar to Part B claims.

-   ### Part B, unassigned

> Claims for Part B medical services from providers that do not accept
> Medicare assignment; payment for unassigned claims may be made
> directly to beneficiaries, which affects the format of claims data on
> the MSN.

-   ### DME, assigned

> Claims for durable medical equipment (DME) and related services from
> suppliers that accept Medicare assignment.

-   ### DME, unassigned

> Claims for DME from suppliers that do not accept Medicare assignment;
> payment for unassigned claims may be made directly to beneficiaries,
> which affects the format of claims data on the MSN.

### COMBINED MSNs

> In some instances, multiple claim types may be combined on a single
> MSN. This most commonly occurs with Part A Inpatient and 'B of A'
> claims, with Part B assigned and unassigned claims, and with DME
> assigned and unassigned claims. Instructions related to combined MSNs
> will be found below in any section or subsection that is affected.

### PAY MSNs

> From time to time, beneficiaries may receive an MSN that includes a
> check, refunding an overpayment made (most often) for Part B services,
> either assigned or unassigned.
>
> Instructions related to Pay MSNs will be found below in any section or
> subsection that is affected. Instructions for the check cover sheet
> are located near the rear of this chapter. Instructions for Pay MSN
> envelopes are located in the Envelopes section. In addition, there are
> examples of complete Pay MSNs in the Exhibits section.

## EFFECT OF CLAIM TYPES

> In the specifications below, layout and content instructions can be
> assumed to be global - that is, they apply to all MSNs, regardless of
> what types of claims appear on the notice.
>
> However, there are particular sections and subsections of the MSN
> where the type of claims on the MSN determines not only what specific
> claim data is printed, but also affects the inclusion of other content
> and language across the notice.
>
> If a given subsection is affected by the claim type(s) on the notice,
> specifications for that subsection will be split - into global
> specifications and specifications for each member of the extended
> family.

# - Format Conventions for the MSN

### (Rev. 3210, Issued: 03-03-15, Effective: 04-16-15. Implementation: 04-16-15)

> This information describes the overall format conventions for the MSN.
>
> MSNs are a combination of fixed and variable length sections, using a
> range of different typefaces and type styles, as well as a number of
> static graphic elements. For discussion of the display in specific
> areas of the notice, see the technical specifications beginning in
> section 10.3.3. MACs should establish page layout and page breaks as
> specified by these instructions and exhibits.

### Printing Requirements

> MSN MACs must follow these instructions:

-   Generate all MSN forms by a laser printer.

-   Ensure that the MSN is printed on 8.5 by 11 inch paper, exclusive of
    > perforated marginal pin-feed tabs.

-   Print duplex.

-   Use black ink only on white paper.

-   Use shading as required by the instructions and exhibits.

-   Allow for coding necessary for mail sorting equipment (e.g., bar
    coding, aims marks).

-   Ensure any MAC's notations placed on the MSN do not affect the
    design of the MSN.

-   Refer to the specifications and exhibits for placement of
    information on the MSN.

### Page Margins and Layout

> Use 0.5-inch outer margins on the notice with exceptions when noted in
> the instructions. Alternate approved margins, 0.75-inch left and
> 0.25-inch right, may also be used when extra space is needed for bar
> code placement.

height="2.7866666666666666in"}

> The MSN pages use two different column layouts, full page and
> two-column.
>
> Full-page layouts are 7.5 inches or 540 points wide with 0.5-inch
> margins on each side, as stated above. The Notice title, Foreign
> Language Footer, Section Title, and Claims section use this layout.
> This layout may be used on just a portion of a page, with the
> remainder of the page content split across two columns.
>
> Two-column layouts have two separate 259 point columns with a 22 point
> gutter between, also with 0.5-inch margins on each side. The Summary
> section, Making the Most of Your Medicare section, Claims definitions,
> and Appeals section use this layout. In the specifications below, a
> given subsection may be described as being one-column
>
> wide; this means that the subsection's content runs within one column
> in a two-column layout.

### Type & Graphic Styles

> The MSN uses two typefaces, Minion (serif) and CMS Myriad (sans serif)
> in Opentype format. Minion is a standard system font. The CMS Myriad
> font is customized for CMS use; the font file contains additional
> glyphs to be used in the MSN. (Font files may be requested from CMS,
> or may be included with Chapter 21 on an enclosed CD.)
>
> Type & Graphics Glossary:
>
> **Alignment:** The positioning of text within the page margins.
> Alignment can be flush left, flush right, justified, or centered.
> Flush left and flush right are sometimes referred to as left justified
> and right justified.
>
> **Baseline:** The imaginary line on which the majority of the
> characters in a typeface rest.
>
> **Body Text:** The paragraphs in a document that make up the bulk of
> its content. The body text should be set in an appropriate and
> easy-to-read face, typically at 10- or 12- point size.
>
> **Glyph:** The word glyph is used differently in different contexts.
> In the context of modern computer operating systems, it is often
> defined as a shape in a font that is used to represent a character
> code on screen or paper. The most common example of a glyph is a
> letter, but the symbols and shapes in a font like ITC Zapf Dingbats
> are also glyphs.
>
> **Header:** The short lines of emphasized text that introduce detail
> information in the body text that follows. Also the category of faces
> that are designed to work best in headline text.
>
> **Italic:** A slanting or script-like version of a face. The upright
> faces are often referred to as Roman.
>
> **Leading** (pronounced: ledding)**:** The amount of space added
> between lines of text to make the document legible. The term
> originally referred to the thin lead spacers that printers used to
> physically increase space between lines of metal type. Most
> applications automatically apply standard leading based on the point
> size of the font. Closer leading fits more text on the page, but
> decreases legibility. Looser leading spreads text out to fill a page
> and makes the document easier to read. Leading can also be negative,
> in which case the lines of text are so close that they overlap or
> touch.
>
> **Letterspacing:** Adjusting the average distance between letters in a
> block of text to fit more or less text into the given space or to
> improve legibility. Kerning allows adjustments between individual
> letters; letterspacing is applied to a block of text as a whole.
> Letterspacing is sometimes referred to as tracking or track kerning.
>
> **Margin:** The white spaces around text blocks. Margins typically
> need to be created on the edges of a page, since most printers can\'t
> print to the very edge. White space also makes a document look better
> and easier to read.
>
> **Point:** A unit of measure in typography. There are approximately 72
> points to the inch. A pica is 12 points.
>
> **Point Size:** The common method of measuring type. The distance from
> the top of the highest ascender to the bottom of the lowest descender
> in points. In Europe, type is often measured by the cap-height in
> millimeters.
>
> **Rule:** A solid or dashed graphic line in documents used to separate
> the elements of a page. Rules and other graphic devices should be used
> sparingly, and only for clarifying the function of other elements on
> the page.
>
> **Sans Serif:** A type face that does not have serifs generally a
> low-contrast design. Sans serif faces lend a clean, simple appearance
> to documents.
>
> **Serif**: Small decorative strokes that are added to the end of a
> letter\'s main strokes. Serifs improve readability by leading the eye
> along the line of type.
>
> **Style:** One of the variations in appearance, such as italic and
> bold, that make up the faces in a type family.

height="1.2375in"}

> In most instances, Myriad is used for headers and for
> beneficiary-specific and dynamic information. Minion is typically used
> for instructional body text.
>
> MSN MACs should:

-   Use the exact type point sizes and leading in the specifications.

-   Use uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as bold printing,
    > throughout the form, except as specifically noted in the
    > specifications.

-   Not print text in italic type. In instances where italic is
    > typically used, as in document titles, quotes are used instead
    > (e.g., "Medicare & You" handbook).

> See below for a list of the different type styles used in printing the
> MSN. The styles described below will be referenced throughout the
> detailed section and subsection specifications that follow. All
> elements can be assumed to be printed in 100% black, unless otherwise
> noted.
>
> The naming convention of the different style groups are based on
> usage. Type Header is abbreviated to TH, Type Body to TB, Graphic
> style to GR, and Glyph to GL.

### Language & Style Conventions

> The MSN generally follows CMS conventions for style and language use.
> One MSN- specific convention is noted below:

### facility vs. provider vs. supplier

> When describing the provider of the claimed services on an MSN,
> different terms are used for the different 'extended family' members:
> Part A Inpatient and 'B of A' use "facility," Part B (assigned and
> unassigned) use "provider," and DME notices (assigned and unassigned)
> use "supplier."

### Organizing Principles for Specifications

> The specifications that follow can be assumed to apply globally; when
> specifications vary by extended family member, the specifications will
> indicate which instructions apply globally and which relate to a
> particular member or members of the extended family.
>
> The specifications are organized into chunks that relate to the
> individual subsections of the notice. Each unit of specifications will
> typically contain:

#### POSITION

-   Instructions relating to the position of the subsection and its
    > elements. The position coordinates are based on top and left edge
    > of margin set as (0˝, 0˝). Adjust measurement according to margins
    > used.

-   Dimensions of content area and spacing between subsections.

-   Specifications per section, listed by page position: top, left
    > column, then right column.

#### FORMATTING

-   All figures are style and layout examples. Any magenta guides are
    > for layout reference only and are not to be printed. Refer to
    > exhibits for accurate printed examples.

-   Graphic example of subsection with type formats, graphic style and
    > spacing used, and the content to which those formats are applied.

-   Line by line code containing type, graphic, and spacing styles.

#### DYNAMIC RULES

-   Description of any dynamically generated content within the section,
    and what rules should be applied to generate the content.

#### CONTENT

-   Language and other specific content that should appear.

-   General specifications are presented in Roman text. Type formats are
    > indicated by bracketed codes (e.g., \[TH 1.1\]). Content that
    > should be replicated on the MSN is presented in italic type;
    > dynamic elements within the content are surrounded by curly
    > brackets, {like this}.

> In addition to figures for each subsection, exhibits are available for
> full MSNs for the base design family and worst-case scenarios.
> Reference will be made to corresponding files as needed.

# - Specifications for Section 1: Summary (Page 1)

> ***(Rev. 11510, Issued: 07-28-22, Effective: 01-01-23, Implementation:
> 01-03-23)***

### Notice Title

> This section names the notice, specifies the function of the notice
> and the Medicare program under which the notice's claims are paid, and
> identifies the Federal agencies responsible for generating the notice.

## GLOBAL SPECIFICATIONS POSITION

> This subsection contains information of a fixed size. It does not vary
> in overall width or length.
>
> The content area begins (0˝, 0˝), and is full page or 540 points in
> width, 72 points in
>
> height.
>
> The Department of Health & Human Services seal, a flash image, is 72
> points by 72 points. Indent 9 points from the seal to start the three
> text elements.
>
> MACs are not to change the format of the Notice Title subsection in
> order to use double window envelopes.

### Notice for...

> The first line has the static text "Notice for" followed by the
> beneficiary's given and family names. Note that for space purposes the
> middle initial(s) and suffixes should not be included here.

### Medicare Number

> The second line has a static title and the beneficiary's Medicare
> number.
>
> When possible, the number should be broken by dashes in the format
> (e.g., 1EG4-TE5- MK72).

### Date of This Notice

> The third line has a static title and the date that the notice was
> printed. The date is listed with a spelled-out month, numeric day, and
> complete numeric year (e.g., October 15, 2021).

### Claims Processed...

> On a typical MSN, the fourth line has a static title, "Claims
> Processed Between" and dates that represent the start and end dates of
> the complete claim-processing period. The first date printed should
> correspond to the first day of the period that was reviewed for claims
> prior to the generation of the notice. The final date printed should
> reflect the final day that was reviewed for claims prior to the
> printing of the notice. This period typically spans an entire 90-day
> period prior to the printing of the notice. (Note that this is
> [not]{.underline} the same as the processing dates of the first- and
> last-processed claims on the notice, which may cover a much shorter
> period.)
>
> The dates are listed with a spelled-out month, numeric day, and
> complete numeric year (e.g., October 15, 2021) and are separated by an
> en-dash (not a hyphen); insert spaces to each side of the en-dash. If
> both the first and last date are within the same calendar year, drop
> the year from the first date (e.g., October 15 - November 3, 2021). If
> the dates are in different calendar years, keep the year in both dates
> (e.g., October 15, 2021 - January 3, 2022).
>
> **NOTE:** When printing a Pay MSN or other MSN with a single
> processing date, replace static text "Claims Processed Between" with
> the label "Claims Processed"; on an MSN of this kind, only the single
> processing date should be listed, following the formatting conventions
> described above.

## INPATIENT HOSPITAL DAYS

> Content in the beneficiary-specific portion of this subsection is
> subject to the following variations:

-   If a claim on the notice is for an inpatient hospital stay, and

-   The benefit period associated with the claim was still active on the
    notice date of the MSN - because fewer than 60 days had passed
    between the last claimed date of stay in the benefit period and the
    notice date - then this subsection should list how many covered
    benefit days remain in the benefit period; or

-   The benefit period associated with the claim is closed - because
    > more than 60 days had passed since the last claimed date of stay
    > and the notice date - then this subsection should indicate that
    > the benefit period has ended.

-   There is no benefit period associated with the claim because it was
    > rejected, therefore no benefit days were used.

> The possible dynamic statements for inpatient hospital days are as
> follows:
>
> You have **{#} out of 90 covered benefit days** remaining for the

#### DYNAMIC RULES

> In an open inpatient hospital or skilled nursing facility benefit
> period, the number of remaining covered/reserve days should reflect
> the number of days that remained on the notice date. If the
> beneficiary had no remaining benefit days on that date, but the period
> was still open, then the second inpatient/SNF statement above should
> be used, indicating that all benefit days have been used for the
> period beginning on the stated date.
>
> Only one active benefit period related to the claims listed on the
> statement should be printed. If there are any additional claims that
> pertain to another benefit period, suppress the status.
>
> If claims on the notice use any combination of inpatient hospital
> days, inpatient lifetime reserve days, inpatient mental health care
> days or skilled nursing facility (SNF) days, then all of the
> applicable statements, as described above, should be included in this
> subsection.
>
> If claims did not use lifetime reserve days or inpatient mental health
> care days, suppress this section and list skilled nursing facility
> benefit period immediately after inpatient hospital.

#### DYNAMIC RULES

> The content in this section is nearly entirely dynamically generated.
> It includes the following content elements:

### Description of Part A Inpatient Service

> This column should contain the associated benefit-period start date.
> Language options include:
>
> Benefit period starting {Month DD, YYYY}
>
> The date of service is listed with a spelled-out month, numeric day,
> and complete numeric year (e.g., October 15, 2021).
>
> If there is no active benefit period because the claims are rejected,
> leave this field blank.

### Benefit Days Used

> This column shows the number of benefit days used during the hospital
> or skilled nursing facility admission, it indicates that a claim did
> not use benefit days because all the beneficiary's benefit days for
> the given period have been exhausted, or there was no active benefit
> period because the claim was rejected. Language options include:
>
> 1 day
>
> {#} days none remain none
>
> See Exhibit 2.7 for an example of the "none remain" option.

### Claim Approved?

> This column indicates if a claim item was approved or denied. It also
> indicates if a claim was adjusted. Language options include:
>
> Yes

## NO

> Yes - **adjusted NO** - **adjusted**
>
> See Exhibit 2.8 for an example of an adjusted claim (this example
> shows a Part B MSN, but it can be understood to also apply to other
> members of the extended family).

### Non-Covered Charges

> This column lists the amount of any claim charges that Medicare did
> not cover. Non- covered services will include beneficiary-liable as
> well as provider-liable charges. This figure may be up to eight digits
> long, including cents:
>
> \${###,###.##}
>
> Insert a comma between the thousands' digit and the hundreds' digit of
> any four-figure or higher amount. Use \$0.00 for zero**.**

### Amount Medicare Paid

> This column lists the amount that Medicare paid toward the claim. This
> figure may be up to eight digits long, including cents:
>
> \${###,###.##}
>

> This column lists the beneficiary's total liability for the claim
> item. This figure may be up to eight digits long, including cents:
>
> \${###,###.##}
>
> Insert a comma between the thousands' digit and the hundreds' digit of
> any four-figure or higher amount. Use \$0.00 for zero**.**

### See Notes Below

> This column displays indicators that refer to explanations listed in
> the Notes for Claims Above subsection, which is printed at the bottom
> of the page when applicable.
>
> Note indicators use capital letters, and indicators should be printed
> in alphabetic order, with a comma without space preceding each
> indicator after the first indicator for a line (e.g., A,B,C). Show no
> more than three alphabetic indicators per line. If more than three
>
> indicators are required, print on the next line below. A maximum of
> five notes are allowed per service, so no more than five note
> indicators should ever be listed here.
>
> If the same message is needed for more than one claim or service line
> on a single page, print the same alphabetic code each time the message
> is required on that page. If, however, that same message is required
> on a following page, use a new indicator letter in the appropriate
> alphabetical order for that page.
>
> Continue alphabetical order from page to page - do not restart the
> alphabet on each new page.
>
> If more than 26 alphabetic codes are needed, begin using lowercase
> alphabetic codes (e.g., a,b,c). If more than 52 alphabetic codes are
> needed, repeat using capital letters.

> visit provided. There may be multiple service visit types per one
> level of care.
>
> Whenever possible, the number of level of care and service visit
> provided should be expressed as a whole number, without decimal point
> or trailing zero (e.g. 2, [not]{.underline} 2.0). Only if the number
> is a partial quantity, then include a decimal point and a fractional
> amount, rounded to the nearest tenth (e.g. 2.5, not 2.49). Use the
> most-recent level of care and service visit descriptions. Suppress the
> billing code.

### Service Approved?

> This column indicates if a claim item was approved or denied. It also

> In the case of a dynamic date subtitle, the preference is for each
> individual day to be given a separate subtitle, with claim items
> grouped just by that one date. The date subtitle clusters should then
> be listed chronologically, earliest first. If the claims data for an
> item only includes a range, then that claim item can be listed under a
> range header, which should be sorted chronologically by its start
> date. The date format follows the same conventions outlined above in
> the Claim Header subsection.
>
> In the case of separate providers listed for individual items within a
> claim, each provider should be named in a different subtitle, with
> associated claim items for that provider grouped underneath. The
> provider clusters should be listed alphabetically by provider last
> name or facility name. The provider format follows the same
> conventions outlined above in the Claim Header subsection.
>
> If a single claim includes items with both different dates and
> different clusters, the items should be grouped first by date, then by
> provider, with each listed on a separate line.

# - Claims Calculations

### (Rev. 3210, Issued: 03-03-15, Effective: 04-16-15. Implementation: 04-16-15)

> This section provides calculations for correctly displaying dollar
> amounts in certain columns of the MSN.

> NOTE THAT THE FOLLOWING SECTION HAS BEEN UPDATED TO REFLECT NEW COLUMN
> NAMES, BUT HAS NOT OTHERWISE BEEN ALTERED FROM THE FORMER ITERATION OF
> CHAPTER 21. SSMs ARE TO CONTINUE CURRENT PRACTICE FOR CALCULATIONS
> UNTIL ACCURATE REVISIONS COULD BE MADE AT A FUTURE DATE.

-   Part A - "Claim Approved?" column is new; Is the "Amount Medicare
    Paid" column comparable to the old "Deductible and Coinsurance"
    column? If not, it needs new instructions. Date of Service now shows
    up at top of claim, not in its own column; first column now shows
    Benefit Period date.

-   Part B - "Service Approved?" column is new; Date of Service now
    shows up at top of claim, not in its own column

-   Unassigned Part B - "Service Approved?" column is new; Date of
    Service now shows at top of claim, not in its own column.

-   B of A - "Service Approved?" column is new; Are the
    "Medicare-Approved Amount" and "Amount Medicare Paid" columns
    comparable to the old "Non- Covered Charges" and "Deductible and
    Coinsurance" columns? If not, these need instructions. Date of
    Service now shows up at top of claim, not in its own column.

-   DME - "Item/Service Approved?" column is new; Date of Service now
    shows up at top of claim, not in its own column.

> For the first approved service line, show the lesser of 80 percent (50
> percent if the outpatient psychiatric limit applies, or 100 percent
> for services paid at 100 percent) of the Medicare approved amount,

-   80 percent (50 percent if the outpatient psychiatric limit applies,
    or 100 percent for services paid at 100 percent) of the Medicare
    approved amount less any deductible applied, or

-   The actual amount Medicare paid on the claim minus the amount shown

### Display of the "Maximum You May Be Billed" Column for Claims Submitted with a Beneficiary Paid Amount

1.  **Assigned Claims**

> If an assigned claim is submitted with a beneficiary paid amount, the
> amount(s) in the "Maximum You May Be Billed" column will be reduced by
> the amount the beneficiary prepaid the provider.
>
> Apply the beneficiary paid amount as indicated below to each service
> line sequentially until the beneficiary paid amount is reduced to zero
> or all service lines have been considered.
>
> Step 1: Subtract the amount of the beneficiary check, if any, from the
> patient amount submitted on the claim. Use the difference as the new
> patient paid amount. If there was
>
> no check to the beneficiary, use the patient paid amount submitted on
> the claim for remaining steps.
>
> Step 2: If the new patient paid amount is less than or equal to the
> amount calculated for the "Maximum You May Be Billed" column, subtract
> the new patient paid amount from the original "Maximum You May Be
> Billed" amount, and display the difference in the "Maximum You May Be
> Billed" column for that service line.
>
> Step 3: If the new patient paid amount is greater than the amount
> calculated for the "Maximum You May Be Billed" column, subtract the
> original "Maximum You May Be Billed" amount for the first service line
> from the new patient paid amount, and show zero in the "Maximum You
> May Be Billed" column.
>
> Repeat these steps with any remaining beneficiary paid amounts.

### Unassigned Claims

> If an unassigned claim is submitted with a beneficiary paid amount,
> the amount(s) in the "Maximum You May Be Billed" column will be
> reduced by the amount the beneficiary prepaid the provider. Apply the
> beneficiary paid amount for each service line sequentially until the
> beneficiary paid amount is reduced to zero or all service lines have
> been considered.
>
> Step 1: If the amount the beneficiary paid is less than or equal to
> the amount calculated for the "Maximum You May Be Billed" column,
> subtract the amount the beneficiary paid from that amount, and display
> the difference in the "Maximum You May Be Billed" column for that
> service line.
>
> Step 2: If the amount the beneficiary paid amount is less than or
> equal to the amount calculated for the "Maximum You May Be Billed"
> column, subtract the "Maximum You May Be Billed" amount for the first
> service line from the amount the beneficiary paid, and show zero in
> the "Maximum You May Be Billed" column for that service line.
>
> Repeat these steps with any remaining beneficiary paid amounts.
>
> If there is a balance after all service lines have been considered on
> unassigned claims, that amount is what the beneficiary overpaid the
> provider. A/B MACs (B)/DME MACs have the option of printing claim
> level message [34.3]{.underline} in this situation if their system
> permits.
>
> Print message [34.2]{.underline} on assigned claims when the
> beneficiary paid amount does not exceed coinsurance and deductible and
> for all unassigned claims submitted with a beneficiary paid amount.

### Display of the "Medicare Paid You" Column for Unassigned Claims with a Previous Overpayment Amount Withheld

> The "Medicare Paid You" column should show the actual amount that
> would have been paid if no previous overpayment had been withheld from
> the check issued to the beneficiary. Use message [32.1]{.underline} to
> show the amount by which the check is reduced to recover an
> overpayment from the beneficiary.

### Display of the "Medicare Paid You" Column for Assigned and Unassigned Adjustment Claims

> Show all service lines for the adjustment claim. The "Medicare
> Approved" and "Medicare Paid" columns will display the same allowed
> and paid amounts as were shown on the original MSN for service lines
> that are not subject to adjustment.
>
> The "Medicare Approved" and "Medicare Paid" columns for adjusted
> service lines will show the total combined amount approved and paid
> for both the original and adjusted claim. Likewise, "Claim Total"
> lines for adjusted claims will reflect the combined total amounts
> approved and paid for the original and adjusted claim.
>
> The "Maximum You May Be Billed" column will show the beneficiary's
> total responsibility. The MAC uses message [31.13]{.underline} on all
> adjustments where a partial payment was previously made.

### Suppression of Claims From MSNs

> A/B MACs (A), (B), (HHH), and DME MACs have the option to suppress
> claims from MSNs when **all** of the following three conditions apply:

-   The claim is a coordination of benefits (crossover) claim for
    > Medicaid;

-   There is no resulting beneficiary liability; and

-   Suppression of the MSN is cost effective.

> In addition, if the MAC's system denies an exact duplicate of a claim,
> the MAC may suppress the claim from the MSN. An exact duplicate claim
> is one in which every field of the duplicate claim matches every field
> of the original claim.
>
> Since appeal rights are not affected, do not display claims on MSNs
> for services paid at 100 percent of the fee schedule where no
> deductible or coinsurance is applied, e.g., diagnostic laboratory
> services. If other services on that claim will appear on the MSN,
> include all services being paid.
>
> Upon the beneficiary's request, create and send MSNs for previously
> suppressed claims. Do not suppress claims from MSNs when **any** of
> the following conditions apply:

-   One or more services were denied because one of the exclusions from
    > Medicare coverage in
    > [[1862(a)(1)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
    > the Social Security Act (the Act) applies;

-   The claim is denied as not filed within the time limits required by
    > [[1842(b)(3)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
    > the Act;

-   The claim is denied in full or in part because the beneficiary was
    > not enrolled in Part A or B of Medicare when the services in
    > question were provided; or

-   An initial determination is made on a claim not later than the
    > 45-day period beginning on the date the A/B MAC (A), (B), (HHH),
    > or DME MAC receives a claim.

# - Character Measurements for Fonts

### (Rev. 3210, Issued: 03-03-15, Effective: 04-16-15. Implementation: 04-16-15)

> To facilitate coding within the mainframe for variable text fields,
> the following four charts provide width dimensions for characters used
> in the MSNs. There are two fonts with two weights each, Minion
> Regular, Minion Bold, CMS Myriad Regular and CMS Myriad Bold. All
> character calculations are for 12-point type. Units for the
> measurements are in points, rounded up to the third decimal digit.
>
> **Note**: Myriad Semibold is used in the design but not listed for
> width dimensions because it is only used for static text.

# 40 - General Information, Explanatory, and Denial Messages

### (Rev. 3210, Issued: 03-03-15, Effective: 04-16-15. Implementation: 04-16-15)

> General Information (GI) messages are used on pages 1 and 2 of the
> MSN, under the **Be Informed! How to Report Fraud**, and **Your
> Messages from Medicare** sections. GI messages are messages that
> communicate important information about the Medicare program or that
> serve as important reminders to beneficiaries. CMS communicates which
> messages to use, and when to use them, via Technical Direction Letters
> (TDLs) or Change Requests (CRs).
>
> Explanatory and Denial messages appear under the claims section of the
> MSN. Their purpose is to concisely communicate essential information
> to the beneficiary regarding claim determinations or to serve as an
> educational tool.
>
> The MSN message file is found at the hyperlink at the bottom of this
> section. Messages are grouped in categories for ease of reference
> only. Unless specific messages are specified in instructions by CMS,
> MACs should select and use the most appropriate message(s) for each
> situation to explain the action taken on a service, item, or claim.
>
> MACs are instructed to use the most appropriate message for each
> situation regardless of message category.
>
> Use multiple messages as appropriate including ones grouped within
> different categories. Use the message(s) which best explains the
> situation(s) in the claim.
>
> All denied or reduced services must have an explanation.
>
> The BBA of 1997 requires the amount of Medicare payment for each
> service be included on all Part A Benefit notices, including the MSN
> and Notice of Utilization (NOU.) MACs use message 16.53 on all A/B MAC
> (A) or (HHH) generated notices with payments.
>
> The MAC may combine "add-on" messages with existing messages to create
> a single message within its file.
>
> Each message on the file is tied to an alphabetic code on the MSN.
> Print no more than three alphabetic codes per claim level and three
> alphabetic codes per service line.
>
> Messages containing fill-in blanks may be left as blanks for filling
> in by the system or may be entered into the system with blanks
> pre-filled to create as many specific messages as there are fill-in
> situations.
>
> The message numbering in this section does not have to be used in MAC
> message generating systems.
>
> Certain messages are mandated. These messages and the situations for
> which they are mandated are identified in the MSN message file at the
> hyperlink at the end of this section. This does not eliminate the need
> to use other messages required by instructions elsewhere in the
> manual.
>
> Beneficiary liability "Add-on" messages should be printed in addition
> to denial and reduction messages for charges which the beneficiary is
> determined not liable. Liability "Add-on" messages should print for
> denials or reductions such as:

-   Services that are part of another service or bundled code;

-   Services determined not to be medically necessary in situations
    where the beneficiary was not notified in writing, prior to receipt
    of the service, that Medicare may not make payment;

-   Duplicate charges; and

-   Denials for utilization reasons.
