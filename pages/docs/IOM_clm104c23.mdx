> The CMS understands that physicians may not always provide suppliers
> of DMEPOS with the most specific diagnosis code, and may provide only
> a narrative description. In those cases, suppliers may choose to
> utilize a variety of sources to determine the most specific diagnosis
> code to include on the individual line items of the claim. These
> sources may include, but are not limited to: coding books and
> resources, contact with physicians or other health professionals,
> documentation contained in the patient's medical record, or verbally
> from the patient's physician or other healthcare professional.
>
> Beneficiaries are not required to submit diagnosis codes on
> beneficiary-submitted claims. Beneficiary-submitted claims are filed
> on Form CMS-1490S. For beneficiary-submitted claims, the A/B MAC (B)
> must develop the claim to determine a current and valid diagnosis code
> and may enter the code on the claim.

> **10.2 - Inpatient Claim Diagnosis Reporting**\
> **(Rev. 3081, Issued: 09-26-14, Effective: Upon Implementation of
> ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)**
>
> On inpatient claims providers must report the principal diagnosis. The
> principal diagnosis is the condition established after study to be
> chiefly responsible for the admission. Even
>
> though another diagnosis may be more severe than the principal
> diagnosis, the principal diagnosis, as defined above, is entered.
> Entering any other diagnosis may result in incorrect assignment of a
> Medicare Severity - Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) and an incorrect
> payment to a hospital under PPS. See Chapter 25, Completing and
> Processing the Form CMS-1450 Data Set, for instructions about
> completing the claim.
>
> Other diagnoses codes are required on inpatient claims and are used in
> determining the appropriate MS-DRG. The provider reports the full
> codes for up to twenty four additional conditions if they coexisted at
> the time of admission or developed subsequently, and which had an
> effect upon the treatment or the length of stay.
>
> The principal diagnosis should not under any circumstances be
> duplicated as an additional or secondary diagnosis. If the provider
> reports duplicate diagnoses they are eliminated in Medicare Code
> Editor (MCE) before GROUPER.
>
> The Admitting Diagnosis Code is required for inpatient hospital claims
> subject to A/B MAC (A) review. The admitting diagnosis is the
> condition identified by the physician at the time of the patient's
> admission requiring hospitalization. For outpatient bills, the field
> defined as Patient's Reason for Visit is not required by Medicare but
> may be used by providers for nonscheduled visits for outpatient bills.
>
> **10.3 - Outpatient Claim Diagnosis Reporting**\
> **(Rev. 3081, Issued: 09-26-14, Effective: Upon Implementation of
> ICD-10, Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)**
>
> For outpatient claims, providers report the full diagnosis code for
> the diagnosis shown to be chiefly responsible for the outpatient
> services. For instance, if a patient is seen on an outpatient basis
> for an evaluation of a symptom (e.g., cough) for which a definitive
> diagnosis is not made, the symptom is reported. If, during the course
> of the outpatient evaluation and treatment, a definitive diagnosis is
> made (e.g., acute bronchitis), the definitive diagnosis is reported.
> If the patient arrives at the hospital for examination or testing
> without a referring diagnosis and cannot provide a complaint, symptom,
> or\
> diagnosis, the hospital reports the encounter code that most
> accurately reflects the reason for the encounter.
>
> Examples include:\
> • Z00.00 Encounter for general adult medical examination without
> abnormal findings • Z00.01 Encounter for general adult medical
> examination with abnormal findings • Z01.10 Encounter for examination
> of ears and hearing without abnormal findings •\
> Z01.118 Encounter for examination of ears and hearing with other
> abnormal findings
>
> For outpatient claims, providers report the full diagnosis codes for
> up to 24 other diagnoses that coexisted in addition to the diagnosis
> reported as the principal diagnosis. For instance, if the patient is
> referred to a hospital for evaluation of hypertension and the medical
> record also documents diabetes, diabetes is reported as another
> diagnosis.

>
> ICD procedure codes are required for inpatient hospital Part A claims
> only. Healthcare Common Procedure Code System (HCPCS) codes are used
> for reporting procedures on other claim types. Inpatient hospital
> claims require reporting the principal procedure if a significant
> procedure occurred during the hospitalization. For information of the
> selection of the principal procedure, see the Official ICD-10-PCS
> coding guidelines posted with the annual updates to ICD-10-PCS posted
> at
>
> The principal procedure code and other procedure codes shown on the
> bill **must** be the full ICD-9-CM, Volume 3, or ICD-10-PCS procedure
> code, including all applicable digits, up to seven digits.
>
> Up to twenty four significant procedures other than the principal
> procedure may be reported.

> **10.5 - Coding for Outpatient Services and Physician Offices (Rev.
> 3081, Issued: 09-26-14, Effective: Upon Implementation of ICD-10,
> Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)**
>
> The Official ICD-10-CM Coding Guidelines include a section for
> Outpatient Services (hospital-based and physician office). These
> guidelines can be found in the annual updates to ICD-10-CM posted at
>
> A/B MACs (A), (B), (HHH), and DME MACs, physicians, hospitals, and

> **10.6 - Relationship of Diagnosis Codes and Date of Service (Rev.
> 3081, Issued: 09-26-14, Effective: Upon Implementation of ICD-10,
> Implementation: Upon Implementation of ICD-10)**
>
> Diagnosis codes must be reported based on the date of service
> (including, when applicable, the date of discharge) on the claim and
> not the date the claim is prepared or received. A/B MACs (A), (B),
> (HHH), and DME MACs are required to edit claims on this basis,
> including providing for annual updates each October.
>
> Shared systems must maintain date parameters for diagnosis editing.
> Use of actual effective and end dates is required when new diagnosis
> codes are issued or current codes become obsolete with the annual
> updates.
>
> The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
> requires that medical code sets must be date-of-service compliant.
> Since ICD diagnosis codes are a medical code set, effective for dates
> of service on and after October 1, 2004, CMS does not provide any
> grace period for providers to use in billing discontinued diagnosis
> codes on Medicare claims. The updated codes are published in the
> Federal Register each year as part of the Proposed Changes to the
> Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems in table 6 and
> effective each October 1.
>
> All MACs will return claims containing a discontinued diagnosis code
> as unprocessable.
>
> For dates of service beginning October 1, 2004, physicians,
> practitioners, and suppliers must use the current and valid diagnosis
> code that is then in effect for the date of service. After the updated
> codes are published in the Federal Register, CMS places the new,
> revised and discontinued codes on the ICD-9 or ICD-10 Web site as
> applicable.
>
> or
>
> The CMS sends the updated codes to All MACs on an annual basis via a
> recurring update notification instruction. This is normally released
> to MACs each June, and contains the new, revised, and discontinued
> diagnosis codes which are effective for dates of service on and after

> • Both the AMA and CMS will encourage health insurance organizations
> to adopt CPT-4 for the reporting of physicians' services in order to
> achieve the widest possible acceptance of the system and the

>
> The AMA updates and republishes CPT-4 annually and provides CMS with

> and describe non-overlapping services even though they may occur
> during the same encounter.
>
> a\. Modifier 59 or --XE is used appropriately for 2 services described
> by timed codes provided during the same encounter only when they are
> performed sequentially.There is an appropriate use for modifiers 59 or
> **--**XE that is applicable only to codes for which the unit of
> service is a measure of time (e.g., per 15 minutes, per hour). If 2
> timed services are provided in blocks of time that are separate and
> distinct (i.e., the same time block is not used to determine the unit
> of service for both codes), modifier 59 may be used to identify the
> services.
>
> b\. Modifier 59 or --XU is used appropriately for a diagnostic
> procedure, which precedes a therapeutic procedure only when the
> diagnostic procedure is the basis for performing the therapeutic
> procedure.When a diagnostic procedure precedes a surgical procedure or
> on-
>
> surgical therapeutic procedure and is the basis on which the decision
> to perform the surgical procedure is made, that diagnostic test may be
> considered to be a separate and distinct procedure as long as (a) it
> occurs before the therapeutic procedure and is not interspersed with
> services that are required for the therapeutic intervention; (b) it
> clearly provides the information needed to decide whether to proceed
> with the therapeutic procedure; (c) it does not constitute a service
> that would have otherwise been required during the therapeutic
> intervention; and d) it is not specifically prohibited. If the
> diagnostic procedure is an inherent component of the surgical
> procedure, it should not be reported separately.
>
> c\. Modifier 59 or --XU is used appropriately for a diagnostic
> procedure, which occurs subsequent to a completed therapeutic
> procedure only when the diagnostic procedure is not a common,
> expected, or necessary follow-up to the therapeutic procedure.When a
> diagnostic procedure follows the surgical procedure or non-surgical
> therapeutic procedure, that diagnostic procedure may be considered to

> intervention. If the post-procedure diagnostic procedure is an
> inherent component or otherwise included (or not separately payable)
> post-procedure service of the surgical procedure or non-surgical

>
> 5\. Modifiers 59 or **--**X{EPSU} are used inappropriately if the
> basis for their use is that the narrative description of the 2 codes
> is different.
>
> C. Modifier 91
>
> Modifier 91 may be appended to laboratory procedure(s) or service(s)
> to indicate a repeat test or procedure on the same day when
> appropriate. If a HCPCS/CPT code has an MUE that is adjudicated as a
> claim line edit, (i.e., MAI equal to "1") appropriate use of CPT
> modifiers (i.e., 59 or -X{EPSU}, 76, 77, 91, anatomic) may be used to
> report the same HCPCS/CPT code on separate lines of a claim. This
> modifier indicates to the Medicare contractors that the physician had
> to perform a repeat clinical diagnostic laboratory test that was
> distinct or separate from a lab panel or other lab services performed
> on the same day, and was performed to obtain medically necessary
> subsequent reportable test values. This modifier must not be used to
> report repeat laboratory testing due to laboratory errors, quality
> control, or confirmation of results.
>
> For example, if a laboratory performs all tests included in a panel of
> laboratory tests and repeats one of these component tests as a
> medically reasonable and necessary service on the same date of
> service, the HCPCS code corresponding to the repeat laboratory test
> may be reported with modifier 91 appended.

>
> General Instructions on MUEs:
>
> •MUEs are set high enough to allow for medically likely daily
> frequencies of services provided in most settings. Because MUEs are
> based on current coding instructions and practices, MUEs are
> prospective edits applicable to the time period for which the edit is
> effective. A change in an MUE is not retroactive and has no bearing on
> prior services unless specifically updated with a retroactive
> effective date. In the unusual case of a retroactive MUE change, MACs
> are not expected to identify claims but should reopen impacted claims
> that providers or suppliers bring to their attention.
>
> •Since MUEs are auto-deny edits, denials may be appealed. Appeals
> shall be submitted to the appropriate MAC not the NCCI contractor.
> MACs adjudicating an appeal for a claim denial for a HCPCS code with
> an MAI of "1" or "3" may pay correctly coded correctly counted
> medically necessary UOS in excess of the MUE value.

•A denial of services due to an MUE is a coding denial, not a medical
necessity denial.

> The presence of an Advance Beneficiary Notice (ABN) shall not shift
> liability to the beneficiary for UOS denied based on an MUE. If during
> reopening or redetermination medical records are provided with respect
> to an MUE denial for an edit with an MAI of "3", MACs will review the
> records to determine if the provider or supplier actually furnished
> units in excess of the MUE, if the codes were used correctly, and
> whether the services were medically reasonable and necessary. If the
> units were actually provided but one of the other conditions is not
> met, a change in denial reason may be warranted (for example, a change
> from the MUE denial based on incorrect coding to a\
> determination that the item/service is not reasonable and necessary
> under section 1862(a)(1)). This may also be true for certain edits
> with an MAI of "1." The CMS interprets the notice delivery
> requirements under Section1879 of the Social Security Act (the Act) as
> applying to situations in which a provider or supplier expects the
> initial claim determination to be a reasonable and necessary denial.
> Consistent with NCCI program guidance, denials resulting from MUEs are
> not based on any of the statutory provisions that give liability
> protection to beneficiaries under section 1879 of the Social Security
> Act. Thus, ABN issuance based on an MUE is NOT appropriate. A provider

> 1717, Issued: 04-24-09, Effective: 07-01-09, Implementation:
> 07-06-09)**
>
> Following is a general description of services paid under the Medicare
> Physicians' Fee Schedule (MPFS).
>
> **A. Physician's Services**
>
> Effective with services furnished on or after January 1, 1992, A/B
> MACs (B) pay for physicians' services based on the MPFS. The Medicare
> allowed charge for such\
> physicians' services is the lower of the actual charge or the fee
> schedule amount. The Medicare payment is 80 percent of the allowed
> charge after the deductible is met for most services paid based on the
> fee schedule. Exceptions to the rule, e.g., services for which
> deductible is not applicable, are specifically identified for the
> service where the exception applies.

The Physicians Fee Schedule is used when paying for the following
physicians' services.

> • Professional services (including attending physicians' services
> furnished in teaching settings) of doctors of medicine and osteopathy
> (including osteopathic\
> practitioners), doctors of optometry, doctors of podiatry, doctors of
> dental surgery and dental medicine, and chiropractors;
>
> • Services covered incident to physicians' services other than certain
> drugs covered as incident to services;
>
> • Physical and occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology
> services furnished by physical therapists, occupational therapists,
> and speech-language pathologists in private practices;
>
> • Diagnostic tests other than clinical laboratory tests. See chapter
> 16 for payment for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests;
>
> • Radiology services; and
>
> • Monthly capitation payment (MCP) for physicians' services associated
> with the continuing medical management of end stage renal disease
> (ESRD) services.
>
> The fee schedule is not used to pay for direct medical and surgical
> services of teaching physicians in hospitals that have elected cost
> payment underof the Act.
>
> When processing a claim, A/B MACs (B) continue to determine if a
> service is reasonable and necessary to treat illness or injury. If a
> service is not reasonable and necessary to treat illness or injury for
> any reason (including lack of safety and efficacy because it is an
> experimental procedure, etc.), A/B MACs (B) consider the service
> noncovered\
> notwithstanding the presence of a payment amount for the service in
> the Medicare fee schedule. The presence of a payment amount in the
> MPFS and the Medicare physician fee schedule database (MPFSDB) does
> not imply that CMS has determined that the service may be covered by
> Medicare. The nature of the status indicator in the database does not
> control coverage except where the status is N for noncovered.
>
> A/B MACs (B) pay the above-mentioned physician services according to
> the physician fee schedule when billed by the following entities:
>
> • A physician or physician group including optometrists, dentists,
> oral and maxillofacial surgeons, podiatrists, and chiropractors;
>
> • A privately practicing physical therapist, (for outpatient physical
> therapy services);
>
> • A privately practicing speech-language pathologist (for outpatient
> speech-language services);
>
> • A privately practicing occupational therapist (for outpatient
> occupational therapy services);
>
> • A nonphysician practitioner including a nurse practitioner, a
> physician assistant, and a clinical nurse specialist beginning January
> 1, 1998, with respect to services these practitioners are authorized
> to furnish under state law: payment is equal to 85 percent of the
> participating physician fee schedule amount for the same service;
>
> • A nurse midwife: payment is equal to 65 percent of the participating
> physician fee schedule amount for the same service;
>
> • A registered dietitian or nutrition professional, for medical
> nutrition therapy services provided as of January 1, 2002: payment is
> equal to 85 percent of the participating physician fee schedule amount
> for the same service;
>
> • An audiologist, for services rendered to beneficiaries not in a
> skilled nursing facility (SNF) Part A covered stay;
>
> • A clinical psychologist who renders services in community mental
> health centers (CMHCs) on or after July 1, 1988, and in all settings
> on or after July 1, 1990;
>
> • A clinical social worker: The fee schedule for CSW services is set
> at 75 percent of the fee schedule for comparable services furnished by
> clinical psychologists;
>
> • Another entity that furnishes outpatient physical therapy,
> occupational therapy, and speech- language pathology services. This
> could be a rehabilitation agency, a public health agency, a clinic, a
> skilled nursing facility, a home health agency (for beneficiaries who
> are not eligible for home health benefits because they are not home
> bound beneficiaries entitled to home health benefits), hospitals (when
> such services are provided to an outpatient or to a hospital inpatient
> who is entitled to benefits under Part A but who has exhausted
> benefits during a spell of illness, or who is not entitled to Part A
> benefits) and comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities
> (CORFs). The fee schedule also applies to outpatient rehabilitation
> services furnished under an arrangement with any of the enumerated
> entities that are to be paid on the basis of the physician fee
> schedule;
>
> • The supplier of the technical component of any radiology or
> diagnostic service;
>
> • An independent laboratory doing anatomic pathology services; and
>
> • Services billed by entities authorized to bill for physicians,
> suppliers, etc. under the reassignment rules.
>
> **B. Hospice Services**
>
> The Physicians Fee Schedule is used when paying for hospice
> physician's services by the A/B MAC (HHH). Regular hospice services
> are paid under the hospice rate schedule (see chapter 11.)
>
> **C. Outpatient Rehabilitation Services**
>
> Effective with services furnished on or after January 1, 1999, A/B
> MACs (A) pay for outpatient rehabilitation services based on the MPFS.
> Services included are physical therapy, speech-language pathology,
> occupational therapy, and certain audiology and CORF services.
>
> Effective with services furnished on or after July 1, 2000, A/B MACs
> (A) pay for all CORF services under the MPFS.
>
> Effective with claims with dates of service on or after July 1, 2003,
> OPTs/Outpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (ORFs), (74X bill type) are
> required to report all their services utilizing HCPCS. A/B MACs (A)
> are required to make payment for these services under the MPFS unless
> the item or service is currently being paid under the orthotic fee
> schedule or the item is a drug, biological, supply or vaccine.
>
> The MPFS applies when these services are furnished by rehabilitation
> agencies, (outpatient physical therapy providers and CORFs), hospitals
> (to outpatients and inpatients who are not in a covered Part A stay),
> SNFs (to residents not in a covered Part A stay and to\
> nonresidents who receive outpatient rehabilitation services from the
> SNF), and HHAs (to individuals who are not homebound or otherwise are
> not receiving services under a home health plan of treatment). The
> MPFS is used as a method of payment for outpatient rehabilitation
> services furnished under arrangement with any of these providers. The
> MPFS allowed charge for these services is the lower of the actual
> charge or the fee schedule amount. The Medicare payment for the
> services is 80 percent of the allowed charge after the Part B
> deductible is met. This is a final payment. The MPFS does not apply to
> outpatient rehabilitation services furnished by critical access
> hospitals (CAHs). CAHs are paid on a reasonable cost basis.
>
> Application of the Outpatient Mental Health Treatment Limitation (A/B
> MACs (A))
>
> In accordance withof the Act, payment is made at 62½ percent of the
> approved amount for outpatient mental health treatment services. This
> provision will continue to be implemented in accordance with the Act
> when these services are furnished to beneficiaries by CORFs.
> Therefore, make payment at 62½ percent of 80 percent of the approved
> amount (or in effect 50 percent) for outpatient mental health
> treatment services.
>
> **D. SNF Services**
>
> Effective with services furnished on or after April 1, 2001, A/B MACs
> (A) pay for Part B services furnished to SNF Part B inpatients and
> outpatients (22X and 23X types of bill) under the MPFS and other
> applicable fee schedules. Thus, where a fee schedule exists for the
> type of service, the fee amount (or charge if less than the applicable
> fee amount) is paid.

Fee schedules made effective for SNF on this date include: Therapy, Lab,
and DMEPOS.

> Effective for services furnished by a SNF on and after January 1,
> 2002, A/B MACs (A) pay SNFs for radiology, other diagnostic, and other
> services under the MPFS. Payment is the lower of billed charges or the
> fee schedule amount. In either case, any applicable\
> deductible and coinsurance amounts are subtracted from the payment
> amount prior to payment. Coinsurance is calculated on the Medicare
> payment amount after the subtraction of any applicable deductible
> amount.
>
> If there is no fee schedule for the service or item being billed, A/B
> MACs (A) and (HHH) are to make payment based on cost. Consequently,
> all services billed under Part B are to be billed using HCPCS codes,
> whether the beneficiary resides in a certified bed or a\
> noncertified bed.
>
> **30.1 - Maintenance Process for the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule
> Database (MPFSDB)**\
> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> The CMS calculates the fee schedule payment amounts and releases them
> to the A/B MACs (B) in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Database
> (MPFSDB). A/B MACs (B) implement those payment amounts on January 1 of
> each year. The CMS maintains the payment files centrally and is
> responsible for recalculating any revised payment amounts.
>
> Any revisions initiated by Central Office (fee schedule amounts or
> payment policy indicators) are issued to the A/B MACs (B) on a
> quarterly basis.
>
> The information for the ongoing maintenance of the MPFSDB is stated
> below.
>
> • CMS calculates the new fee schedule amounts. The CMS Central Office
> issues the revised data to the ROs in the same format of the MPFSDB.
>
> • A/B MACs (B) receive a file containing data with revisions for the
> quarter. This file is released electronically via CMS' Mainframe
> Telecommunications System.
>
> • A/B MACs (B) must allow providers 30 days notification before
> revised payment amounts are implemented. The revised payment amounts
> are implemented the beginning of the following quarter.
>
> • CMS furnishes the recalculated payment amounts to the A/B MACs (B)
> in data files to ensure accuracy. A/B MACs (B) overlay these files
> into their existing file, to eliminate the potential for errors.
>
> • A/B MACs (B) must make adjustments on those claims that were
> processed incorrectly if the adjustment is requested by the
> physician/supplier. Adjustments are made retroactively to January 1 of
> the current year, unless otherwise specified.
>
> This directive applies in all instances unless the situation requires
> special consideration. In those instances, instructions on handling
> adjustments will be provided on a case-by-case basis.
>
> Separate instructions are issued describing the data exchange for the
> A/B MACs (A) and (HHH)
>
> • .In summary, A/B MACs (A) and (HHH) receive the revised payment
> amounts two to three weeks after the A/B MACs (B) receive the data
> from CMS. A/B MACs (A) and (HHH) do not implement the revised payment

>
> The following instructions apply in situations where the CMS CO does
> NOT provide pricing guidance via the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule
> Database (MPFSDB) for physicians' services.
>
> If a new code appears, A/B MACs (B) make every effort to determine
> whether the\
> procedure, drug or supply has a pricing history and profile. If there
> is a pricing history, map the new code to previous customary and
> prevailing charges or fee schedule amounts to ensure continuity of
> pricing.
>
> Since there are different kinds of coding implosions and explosions,
> the way the principle is applied varies. For example, when the code
> for a single procedure is exploded into several codes for the
> components of that procedure, the total of the separate relative value
> unit or other charge screens established for the components must not
> be higher than the relative value units or other charge screens for
> the original service. However, when there is a single code that
> describes two or more distinct complete services (e.g., two different
> but related or similar surgical procedures), and separate codes are
> subsequently established for each, continue to apply the payment
> screens that applied to the single code to each of the services
> described by the new codes.
>
> If there is no pricing history or coding implosion and explosion, A/B
> MACs (B) must make an individual consideration determination for
> pricing and payment of a covered service.
>

> (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**\
> **B-02-075**
>
> Transportation for portable x-ray services (HCPCS code R0070) is paid
> under the Medicare physician fee schedule. There are no national
> values for this service. The CMS has not established national relative
> values for this service because there are no national data for these
> services and because there are significant differences in the delivery
> of this service in different geographic areas. Instead, each A/B MAC
> (B) is required to determine the payment amounts for its geographic
> areas.
>
> The CMS has not established specific criteria that A/B MACs (B) should
> use in\
> determining the payment amounts they establish for "A/B MAC (B)
> priced" services. The CMS has not established a specific annual update
> factor to be applied to these services.
>
> Mid-year adjustments are possible if the A/B MAC (B) believes such
> adjustments are appropriate. Such an appropriation provides A/B MACs
> (B) with the flexibility to take into account local factors affecting
> the level of resources required to perform this service.
>
> A/B MACs (B) should periodically review (at least every five years, or
> more frequently if local conditions warrant) their locally determined
> payment amounts to determine whether the payment amounts reflect the
> relative resources (e.g., staff, equipment, supplies and general
> expenses) required to perform A/B MAC (B)-priced services. Such
> periodic
>
> reviews for A/B MAC (B) priced services would be consistent with
> statutory requirements. If portable x-ray transportation suppliers
> request such a review, A/B MACs (B) should work with the local
> suppliers to review the payment amounts for R0070, taking into account
> local factors and any data available regarding the resources required
> to provide these services.

> **(Rev. 2643, Issued: 01-31-13, Effective: 07-01-13, Implementation:
> 07-01-13)**
>
> The Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 16, "Laboratory
> Services From Independent Labs, Physicians, and Providers," provides
> background and additional information for payment of laboratory
> services.
>
> Clinical diagnostic laboratory tests - whether performed in a
> physician's office, by an independent laboratory, or by a hospital
> laboratory for its outpatients - are paid based on fee schedules. This
> section sets out rules for use of these schedules.
>
> The fee schedule amounts are adjusted annually to reflect changes in
> the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all Urban Consumers (U.S. city
> average), or as otherwise specified by legislation. Adjustments are
> applied and amounts are determined by CMS and published for A/B MAC
> (A), (B), and (HHH) use and also on CMS Web site. A/B MACs (A), (B),
> and (HHH) are notified when and where updates are published.
>
> For a cervical or vaginal smear test (pap smear), payment is the
> lesser of the local fee or the national limitation amount, but not
> less than the national minimum payment amount. However, in no case may
> payment for these tests exceed actual charges. The Part B deductible
> and coinsurance do not apply.
>
> Regardless of whether a diagnostic laboratory test is performed in a
> physician's office, by an independent laboratory, or by a hospital
> laboratory for its outpatients or nonpatients, it is considered a
> laboratory service. When a hospital laboratory performs diagnostic
> laboratory tests for nonhospital patients, the laboratory is
> functioning as an independent laboratory.
>
> National minimum limitation amounts are established each year for
> cervical or vaginal smear clinical laboratory tests. These payment
> amounts are published each year in a Recurring Update Notification
> issued by CMS. The affected CPT laboratory test codes for the national
> minimum payment amount are also identified in the annual Recurring
> Update Notification. National maximum limitation amounts may also be
> established for certain services and are also published each year this
> Recurring Update Notification.
>
> A/B MACs (A), (B), and (HHH) pay the lowest of the applicable current
> fee schedule, the actual charge, or the NLA. This applies to all
> clinical diagnostic laboratory tests except:
>
> • Laboratory tests furnished to a hospital inpatient whose stay is
> covered under Part A;
>
> • Laboratory tests performed by a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) for
> its own SNF inpatients and reimbursed under Part A or Part B and any
> laboratory tests furnished under arrangements to an SNF inpatient with
> Part A coverage. (The only covered source for laboratory services
> furnished under Part A is the SNF itself or a hospital with which the
> facility has a transfer agreement in effect.)
>
> • Laboratory tests furnished by hospital-based or independent ESRD
> dialysis facilities that are included under the ESRD composite rate
> payment;
>
> • Laboratory tests furnished by hospitals in States or areas which
> have been granted demonstration waivers of Medicare reimbursement
> principles for outpatient services. The State of Maryland has been
> granted such demonstration waivers;
>
> • Laboratory tests furnished to inpatients of a hospital with a waiver
> under §602(k) of the 1983 Amendments to the Act. This section of the
> Act provides that an outside supplier may bill under Part B for
> laboratory and other nonphysician services furnished to inpatients
> that are otherwise paid only though the hospital;
>
> • Laboratory tests furnished to patients of rural health clinics
> (RHCs) under an all inclusive rate;
>
> • Laboratory tests provided by a participating health maintenance
> organization (HMO) or health care prepayment plan (HCPP) to an
> enrolled member of the plan; and

> 10-01-03)**\
> **AB-01-162, AB-02-163**
>
> In accordance with §531(b) of the Benefits Improvement and Protection
> Act of 2000 (BIPA), CMS solicits public comments on determining
> payment amounts for new laboratory tests. The CMS hosts an annual
> public meeting to allow parties the opportunity to provide input to
> the payment determination process. The CMS employs one of two
> approaches to establishing payment amounts for new laboratory test
> codes, crosswalking and gap-filling. After considering public input
> regarding the new test codes, CMS determines which approach is most
> appropriate for each new test code.
>
> If the new test is comparable to an existing test, the new test is
> "crosswalked" to the existing test, and it is assigned the local fee
> for the existing test and the corresponding NLA. The new test code and
> payment amounts are included in the updated laboratory fee schedule
> annually.
>
> If CMS determines that the laboratory fee schedule includes no
> sufficiently comparable test to permit crosswalking, CMS instructs A/B
> MACs (B) to "gap-fill" the payment amount
>
> for the new test code. Gap-filling is an empirical process of
> determining a payment amount in a locality using available information
> sources. Usually the period during which gap-filled payment amounts
> are instructed is the year following the introduction of a new code.
> During this period, A/B MACs (B) establish and use these payment
> amounts; they may be revised in the course of the year. Also during
> this period, A/B MACs (B) must report the gap-fill amounts to their
> ROs which are then forwarded to CMS CO. The CMS considers the gap-fill
> amounts and uses them to establish the fees for the new test code in
> the next update of the laboratory fee schedule.
>
> In determining gap-fill amounts, the sources of information A/B MACs
> (B) should examine, if available, include: charges for the test and
> routine discounts to charges; resources required to perform the test;
> payment amounts determined by other payers; and charges, payment
> amounts, and resources required for other tests that may be comparable
> or otherwise relevant. A/B MACs (B) may consider other sources of
> information as appropriate, including clinical studies and information
> provided by clinicians practicing in the area, manufacturers, or other
> interested parties. To assist each A/B MAC (B) in establishing a
> gap-fill amount, A/B MACs (B)' Medical Directors may meet and share
> information regarding the new test, though without reaching a formal
> consensus.
>
> Establishing payment amounts for new laboratory tests is inherently
> difficult, precisely because these tests are new and as a result the
> types and extent of information available about them may be limited.
> Because the circumstances of different tests may vary\
> significantly, specifying in detail a method of using the various
> information sources outlined above does not appear appropriate at this
> time. However, CMS designates a new test code for gap-filling in
> instances where no test code seems sufficiently similar to make a
> crosswalk approach appropriate. Accordingly, A/B MACs (B) should not
> determine a gap-fill amount by crosswalking to the payment amount for
> another test code.
>
> After determining a gap-fill amount, an A/B MAC (B) may consider if a
> least costly alternative to a new test exists. If an A/B MAC (B)
> determines a least costly alternative test exists, the A/B MAC (B) may
> adopt the payment amount of the least costly alternative test as the
> gap-fill amount for the new test code. The least costly alternative
> amount will be considered the local fee, and CMS will use this payment
> amount in establishing the NLA.
>
> However in this case, the A/B MAC (B) must report two payment amounts,
> the gap-fill amount prior to determination of a least costly
> alternative and the payment amount that the A/B MAC (B) has determined
> to be the least costly alternative.
>
> A/B MACs (B) should also communicate the gap-fill amounts to
> corresponding A/B MACs (A) and (HHH). A/B MACs (B) can seek assistance
> from RO staff to facilitate\
> communication of the gap-fill amounts to A/B MACs (A) and (HHH). The
> list of codes which A/B MACs (B) are required to gap-fill each year
> are communicated in the annual instructions.
>
> A/B MACs (B) provide their RO with gap-fill fees according to the date
> communicated by CMS (usually May), to be used by CMS-Central for the
> development of subsequent or later laboratory fee schedules. A/B MACs
> (B) submit the gap-fill fees in a right-justified
>
> format. These gap-fill data should be transmitted in an ASCII file
> with the following file specifications to MStevenson@cms.hhs.gov with
> a copy to Agreenberg@cms.hhs.gov to assist with coordinated collection
> of the gap-fill fees.

>
> A separate DMEPOS Fee Schedule file is released to A/B MACs (A) and

> \
> for other interested parties like the State Medicaid agencies and

> January 1.
>
> *Effective February 28, 2022, national fee schedule amounts for new

>
> *Benefit category determinations are made using the public meeting

>
> • The DME MACs identify instances where base year fees are incorrect

> • For inherent reasonableness (IR) changes, the effective date of the

>
> • Concurrently, DDP issues instructions for implementing the revised

>
> • DME MACs and A/B MACs should give providers 30 days' notice before

>
> • DME MACs and A/B MACs should make adjustments on those claims that

> If unable to identify comparable item(s), other sources of pricing

> Because a HCPCS code is new does not necessarily mean that Medicare

>
> *When the code for an item is divided into several codes for the

> Effective with services furnished on or after January 1, 1992, A/B
> MACs (B) pay for physicians' services based on a fee schedule.
> Nonphysician services are also paid based on a percentage of fee
> schedule amounts depending on the type of nonphysician and service
>
> rendered. Other services and supplies (e.g., DMEPOS) are paid under
> the fee schedule designed specifically for those services. Beginning
> in 1992, only the services listed below are paid under the reasonable
> charge methodology.
>
> Where payment continues to be made on a reasonable charge basis for
> items and services, other than ambulance and laboratory services, A/B
> MACs (B) compute customary and prevailing charge updates at the
> beginning of each fee screen year (the 12-month period beginning
> January), using available statistics on charges for services from
> claims processed or services rendered during the 12 month period
> ending June 30 immediately preceding the start of the fee screen year.
> For example, the customary and prevailing charge rates established for
> fee screen year 2003 (January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2003) are
> based on the charges made from July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2002.
>
> Instructions regarding payment for ambulance and for laboratory
> services still subject to reasonable charges are found in Medicare
> Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 15,\
> "Ambulance," and Chapter 16, "Laboratory Services from Independent
> Labs, Physicians, and Providers." Additional instructions regarding
> payment for dialysis supplies and equipment are provided in the
> Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 8, "Outpatient ESRD
> Hospital, Independent Facility, and Physician/Supplier Claims."
>
> See specific year Program Memorandum instructions for a list of codes
> that are subject to the inflation-indexed charge (IIC) each year. A/B
> MACs (B) compute each year's IIC screen, by increasing the appropriate
> previous year's screen by the percentage amount specified in annual
> Program Memorandum instructions. A/B MACs (B) must not compute IIC
> screens for items paid using gap-filled payment amounts in the
> previous year. See specific year Program Memorandum instructions for
> any variances to these rules and for each year's specific increase
> percentage.
>
> Services paid on a reasonable charge basis continue to be paid for
> under the rules in this section. A/B MACs (B)/DME MACs have the
> primary responsibility for determining reasonable charges. The
> following guidelines are intended to assure overall consistency among
> A/B MACs (B)/DME MACs with respect to the concepts applied in making

>
> • The prevailing charges in the locality for similar services.

> **80.7 - Determination of Comparable Circumstances (Rev. 1,
> 10-01-03)**\
> **B3-5026**
>
> A/B MACs (B) do not make a reasonable charge determination that would
> be higher than the charge upon which they would base payment to their
> own policyholders for a\
> comparable service under comparable circumstances. The charge upon
> which payment is based does not mean the amount the A/B MAC (B) would
> be obligated to pay. Under certain circumstances, some A/B MACs (B)
> pay amounts on behalf of their policyholders, which are below the
> customary and prevailing charges physicians or other persons usually
> make to the general public. Payments under the medical insurance
> program are not limited to these lower amounts.
>
> "Comparable circumstances" refers to the circumstances under which
> services are rendered to individuals and the nature of your health
> insurance programs, and the method used to determine the amounts of
> payment under these programs. Generally, comparability exists where:
>
> • Payment is made under the contractor's own program on the customary
> charges of physicians or other persons, and on current prevailing
> charges in a locality, and
>
> • The determination does not preclude recognition of factors such as
> specialty status and unusual circumstances that affect the amount
> charged for a service.
>
> However, even where there is comparability, coverage limitations
> applicable under the contractor's own programs do not necessarily
> apply to reasonable charge determinations for Medicare purposes.
>
> The "current" customary and/or prevailing charges of an A/B MAC (B)'s
> private health plan refer to the payment screens that are presently in
> effect, e.g., payment levels actually being used in the A/B MAC (B)'s
> private business for settling claims submitted by its policy holders
> or subscribers. A/B MACs (B) must, therefore, continue to apply the
> comparability limitation based upon their payment screens that are
> presently in effect, even where an update under their private
> insurance plans has been deferred. If an A/B MAC (B)'s private health
> plan allowances are later revised, it will be necessary for the A/B
> MAC (B) to reexamine the relationship of these new payment levels to
> those under the Medicare program an initiate the necessary changes
> through their routine maintenance operations.
>
> Responsibility for determining whether an A/B MAC (B)'s program has
> comparability will fall upon the A/B MAC (B) in reporting pertinent
> information about its programs to CMS.
>
> When the pertinent information has been reported, CMS will advise the
> A/B MAC (B) whether any of its programs have comparability.

> **80.8 - Applying Criteria for Reasonable Charge Determinations (Rev.
> 1, 10-01-03)**\
> **B3-5030, B3-5030.2**
>
> The reasonable charge determination for a covered service should be
> based on the actual charge for the service when that charge is no
> higher than the applicable customary and prevailing charges. The A/B
> MAC (B) should exercise judgment so that its reasonable charge
> determinations are realistic and equitable. A/B MACs (B) should take
> into account special factors in individual cases that might affect the
> reasonableness of charges. The special factors could involve travel,
> medical complications, or other unusual circumstances such as
> prolonged time and attention required by a patient's condition.
>
> Different services and supplies for which charges are made under Part
> B, may not be grouped together for the purpose of making one overall
> reasonable charge determination. Thus, in processing a claim for
> payment a separate reasonable charge determination must be made with
> respect to each item for which a charge is made.

> **80.8.1 - Waiver of Deductible and Coinsurance (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**\
> **B3-5220**
>
> Physicians or suppliers who routinely waive the collection of
> deductible or coinsurance from a beneficiary constitute a violation of
> the law pertaining to false claims and kickbacks. These situations
> should be referred to Program Integrity area for additional
> investigation according to the procedures in the Medicare Program
> Integrity Manual.
>
> Deductible and coinsurance amounts are taken into account (included)
> in determining the reasonable charge for a service or item. In this
> regard, a billed amount that is not reasonably related to an
> expectation of payment is not considered the "actual" charge for the
> purpose of processing a claim or for the purpose of determining
> customary charges.
>
> Where a physician/supplier makes a reasonable collection effort for
> the payment of coinsurance/deductibles, failure to collect payment is
> not considered a reduction in the physician's/supplier's charge. To be
> considered a reasonable collection effort, the effort to collect
> Medicare coinsurance/deductible amounts must be similar to the effort
> made to collect comparable amounts from non-Medicare patients. It must
> also involve the issuance of a bill to the beneficiary or to the party
> responsible for the patient's personal financial obligations. In
> addition, it may include other actions, such as subsequent billings,\
> collection letters and telephone calls or personal contacts which
> constitute a genuine, rather than token, collection effort.

> **(Rev. 1535, Issued: 06-13-08, Effective: 07-01-08, Implementation:
> 07-07-08)**
>
> If new HCPCS codes are established following the start of a
> competitive bidding contract period that describe new technology items
> that did not previously fall under HCPCS codes for competitive bidding
> items, they will not be added to the competitive bidding HCPCS, CBA
> pricing and public use files.
>
> If a HCPCS code descriptor for a competitive bidding item is revised
> to clarify the item described by that code after the competitive
> bidding contract period begins, a\
> corresponding code descriptor change will be made in the competitive
> bidding HCPCS, CBA pricing and public use files.
>
> Should a HCPCS code be deleted from the HCPCS after the competitive
> bidding contract period begins, the deleted code will be considered
> invalid for claims submission under the competitive bidding program
> and will be removed from the competitive bidding HCPCS, CBA pricing
> and public use files. Although the code is discontinued, as explained
> below, the items that previously fell under the code may continue to
> be subject to the competitive bidding program.
>
> If a HCPCS code for a competitive bidding item is revised after the
> contract period for a competitive bidding program begins, CMS will
> adjust the single payment amount(s) for the item(s) on the CBA pricing
> file for that Round using one of the following methods:
>
> a\. If a single HCPCS code for an item is divided into two or more
> HCPCS codes for the components of that item, the sum of the single
> payment amounts for the new HCPCS codes will equal the single payment
> amount for the original item. In accordance with instructions provided
> in future recurring update notifications, the payment amounts for the
> HCPCS codes for the components will be established based on the
> corresponding fee schedule amounts for these codes that are\
> established in accordance with section 60.3 of chapter 23 of the
> Claims Processing Manual. These amounts for the components of the item
> will then be adjusted by the same percentage to the level where the
> sum of the payment amounts for the HCPCS codes for the components
> equals the single payment amount for the item.
>
> b\. If a single HCPCS code is divided into two or more separate HCPCS
> codes for different but similar items, the single payment amount for
> each of the new separate HCPCS codes is equal to the single payment
> amount applied to the original, single HCPCS code.
>
> c\. If the HCPCS codes for components of an item are merged into a
> single HCPCS code for the item, the single payment amount for the new
> HCPCS code is equal to the total of the separate single payment
> amounts for the components.
>
> d\. If multiple HCPCS codes for different but similar items are merged
> into a single HCPCS code, the items to which the new HCPCS codes apply
> may be furnished by any supplier that has a valid Medicare billing
> number. Payment for the new code will be based on the fee schedule
> methodology, even if single payment amounts were established for the
> discontinued multiple HCPCS codes. The old codes will be considered
> invalid and no longer included in the competitive bidding program for
> the remainder of the contract term.
>
> Contract suppliers must furnish the item(s) described by the new HCPCS
> code(s) in scenarios (a) through (c) above and submit claims using the
> new codes. Notification of a competitive bidding HCPCS code change
> will occur through program instruction.
