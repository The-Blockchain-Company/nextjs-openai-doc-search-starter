> EDI for Medicare FFS is not limited to the submission and processing
> of claim related transactions, but includes processes such as provider
> EDI enrollment, beneficiary eligibility, coordination of benefits, as
> well as security and privacy concerns. So as not to be duplicative,

> **(Rev. 2803, Issued: 10-28-13, Effective: 09-17-13, Implementation:
> 09-17-13)**
>
> For a provider, business associate, or other trading partner to engage
> in EDI with Medicare FFS, it must first establish an EDI agreement
> with Medicare. There are two ways to do this: 1) complete and submit
> paper CMS Form 855, or 2) submit an Internet based application via the

>
> The information contained in this chapter will be of interest to
> Medicare providers, business associates or other trading partners, as
> well as others interested in how Medicare has structured its EDI
> policies. Other Medicare FFS and CMS partners as well as general
> audiences may use this as a source of information to determine
> Medicare FFS' EDI practices. Primarily however, this chapter, and
> related chapters, are used by Medicare contractors for descriptive
> guidance to contractual responsibilities they have to CMS.
>
> Therefore, the instructions within this chapter are primarily directed
> to Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs), Durable Medical
> Equipment Medicare\
> Administrative Contractors (DME MACs), the Common Electronic Data
> Interchange (CEDI) contractor for DME MACs, and their shared systems,

> of the current HIPAA compliant version of the Accredited Standards
> Committee (ASC) X12 Technical Report Type 3 (TR3) also known as an ASC
> X12 Implementation Guide (IG) and NCPDP Telecommunication
> Implementation Guide, as well as all Medicare and contractor EDI
> activities related to these transactions. In order to implement the
> HIPAA administrative simplification provisions, specific ASC X12 and
> NCPDP transactions have been named under part 162 of title 45 of the
> Code of Federal Regulations as electronic data interchange (EDI)
> standards for Health Care. All other EDI formats for health care

> Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Electronic

> Furthermore, the Final Rule conveys inclusion of errata documents to

> reference any errata documents by the original mandated regulation
> compliance date through the Federal Register notice(s). Moving
> forward, all newly adopted errata documents are to be accepted and
> integrated as part of the EDI transaction(s). Medicare FFS further
> adopts the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12 and National

>
> EDI practices for healthcare business were embraced more than 20 years
> ago to standardize electronic formats throughout the healthcare
> industry. Usage of EDI in Health care claim processing was initiated
> by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
> 1996(HIPAA), Public Law 104,191. Subtitle F of Title II of HIPAA,
> added to Title XI of the Social Security Act (the Act) a new part
> called section C, entitled "Administrative Simplification" and
> consists of sections 1171 through 1180.
>
> This Federal legislation adopted standards for electronic transactions
> under an\
> Administrative Simplification subtitle. HIPAA mandated the adoption of
> standards for electronically transmitting certain health care
> administrative transactions between all covered entities.
>
> Sections 1171 through 1179 are described below:
>
> • Section 1171 of the Act, established definitions for the following:
> code sets, health care clearinghouses, health care provider, health
> information, health plan,
>
> individually identifiable health information, standard, and standard
> setting organizations (SSO) such as the American National Standards
> Institute (ANSI).
>
> • Section 1172 made any standard adopted applicable to covered
> entities that transmit health information in electronic formats.
> Covered entities include the following:
>
> 1)health plans\
> 2)health care clearinghouses\
> 3)health care providers
>
> •Section 1173 required the adoption of standards for transactions,
> code sets, and unique health identifiers for each individual,
> employer, health plan, and health care provider.
>
> •Section 1174 required the adoption of standards for designated
> transactions, except electronic attachments.
>
> • Section 1175 prohibited health plans from refusing to conduct a
> transaction as a standard transaction, and delaying the processing and
> or adversely affecting its processing.
>
> • Section 1176 established civil monetary penalties for violation of
> the provisions of Part C of Title XI.
>
> • Section 1177 established penalties for any person that knowingly
> misuses a unique health identifier, or obtains or discloses
> individually identifiable health information.
>
> • Section 1178 indicated provisions of Part C of Title XI of the Act,
> as well as any standards or implementation specifications adopted
> under them generally supersede contrary provisions of State law.
>
> • Section 1179 makes these provisions of the Act inapplicable to
> financial institutions or anyone acting on behalf of a financial
> institution when "authorizing, processing, clearing, selling, billing,
> transferring, reconciling, or collecting payments for financial
> institutions.
>
> HIPAA mandates all covered entities to comply with the use and

>
> \(3\) reduces health care costs resulting from inefficiency, medical
> errors, inappropriate care, duplicative care, and incomplete
> information;
>
> \(4\) provides appropriate information to help guide medical decisions
> at the time and place of care;
>
> \(5\) ensures the inclusion of meaningful public input in such

>
> \(6\) improves the coordination of care and information among
> hospitals, laboratories, physician offices, and other entities through
> an effective infrastructure for the secure and authorized exchange of
> health care information;
>
> \(7\) improves public health activities and facilitates the early

>
> EDI registration and enrollment shall be instituted by the A/B MACs

>
> 1.Document the specific type of transactions and transmission methods
> to be utilized and secure authorizations from the provider or other
> trading partner requesting to exchange electronic administrative
> transactions, and
>
> 2.Designate the A/B MACs and CEDI with whom the provider or other
> trading partner agrees to engage in EDI and implements standard
> policies and practices to ensure the security and integrity of the
> information to be exchanged.
>
> Under HIPAA, EDI applies to all covered entities transmitting the

> administrative transactions: ASC X12 837 institutional claim and ASC
> X12 837\
> professional claim, ASC X12 835 remittance advice, ASC X12 270/271
> eligibility, ASC X12 276/277 claim status and NCPDP claim (and others

>
> A/B MACs, or CEDI will assign an EDI submitter/receiver number and a
> periodically renewable password to each entity (provider,
> clearinghouse, billing agent) submitting or receiving electronic
> transactions. Provision must be made to return claim remittance files
> either to the provider or to a designated receiver (which may be the

> 12-14-15)**
>
> The Medicare Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) Enrollment process
> provides for collection of the information needed to successfully
> receive ERA transactions from Medicare and EDI trading partners. This
> agreement must be executed by each provider that receives ERA either
> directly to or from Medicare or through a third party. Each provider
> that will use ERA either directly or through a billing agent or
> clearinghouse with Medicare must sign the ERA Enrollment Form and
> submit it to the A/B MAC or CEDI with which ERA transactions will be
> received before the A/B MAC or CEDI will transmit ERA. A/B MACs or
> CEDI may accept a signed ERA Enrollment Form for providers via fax,
> email, internet portal, or hard copy and may accept electronic
> signature formats, "wet", or a combination of the two. The ERA
> Enrollment Form is effective as specified in the terms of the
> agreement.
>
> In accord with a particular MAC's business processes, providers who
> have a signed ERA Enrollment Form on file with a particular A/B MAC,
> or CEDI may or may not be required to submit a new signed ERA
> Enrollment Form to the same A/B MAC, or CEDI each time they change
> their method of electronic billing or begin to use another type of EDI
> transaction, e.g., changing from direct submission to submission
> through a\
> clearinghouse or changing from one billing agent to another.
> Additionally, providers may or may not be required to notify their A/B
> MAC, or CEDI if their existing\
> clearinghouse begins to use alternate software; the clearinghouse is
> responsible for notification in that instance.
>
> A/B MACs and CEDI must inform providers that providers are obligated
> to notify their A/B MAC or CEDI in writing in advance of a change that
> involves a change in the billing agent(s) or clearinghouse(s) used by
> the provider, the effective date on which the provider will
> discontinue using a specific billing agent and/or clearinghouse, if
> the provider wants to begin to use additional types of EDI
> transactions, or of other changes that might impact their use of ERA.
>
> A/B MAC, or CEDI receives a signed request from a provider or supplier
> to accept ERA transactions from or send ERA transactions to a third
> party, the A/B MAC, or CEDI must verify that an ERA Enrollment Form is
> already on file for that provider or supplier.
>
> The binding information in an ERA Enrollment Form does not expire if
> the person who signed that form for a provider is no longer employed
> by the provider, or that A/B MAC, or CEDI is no longer associated with
> the Medicare program. Medicare responsibility for ERA oversight and
> administration is simply transferred in that case to that entity that
> CMS chooses to replace that A/B MAC, or CEDI, and the provider as an
> entity retains responsibility for those requirements mentioned in the
> form regardless of any change in personnel on staff.
>
> The note at the end of the enrollment agreement language indicates
> that either party can terminate that agreement by providing 30 days
> advance notice. There is an exception to that requirement. In the
> event an A/B MAC, DME MAC or CEDI detects abuse of use of an ERA
> system, or discovers potential fraud or abuse, that A/B MAC, DME MAC
> or CEDI is to immediately terminate system access for receipt of ERA
> transactions by that individual or entity. A decision by an A/B MAC,
> DME MAC or CEDI to terminate or suspend ERA access in such a situation
> is not subject to appeal by the individual or entity that loses ERA
> access.
>
> **NOTE:** Federal law shall govern both the interpretation of this
> document and the appropriate jurisdiction and venue for appealing any
> final decision made by CMS under this document.
>
> This document shall become effective when signed by the provider. The
> responsibilities and obligations contained in this document will
> remain in effect as long as Medicare claims are submitted to the A/B
> MAC, DME MAC, CEDI, or other contractor if
>
> designated by CMS. Either party may terminate this arrangement by

> and communicated to the A/B MACs, CEDI, or other\
> contractors if designated by CMS. Further information on these
> instructions can be found at
>
> In developing the CTP the use case represents the type of response
> expected by each of the test cases within the use case. Following the
> ASC X12 Version 5010 and D.0 Edit Spreadsheets as a guide, a use case
> for each loop transaction was developed. There are multiple test cases
> for each use case.
>
> In most cases, each loop has at least [one]{.underline} "accept" (in

> "reject" use case. The "reject loop" use case contains only one test
> case for the rejection or first negative test of the entire loop.
>
> Depending on the edit type, additional use cases were necessary. For
> example, each loop will have [one]{.underline} ASC X12 999
> implementation acknowledgement use case with multiple test cases,
> [one]{.underline} accepted ("A") use case for "good clean" claims in
> process, flat file mapping, and may have [one]{.underline} ASC X12
> 277CA claim acknowledgement use case with multiple test cases. It may
> be necessary to have more than one data file per use case if there are
> elements which will result in a structural error by the translator. In
> those cases, there are multiple data files per use case.
>
> For NCPDP, each segment has one "accept (in process/flat file
> mapping)" use case, one "reject" use case, and one flat file mapping
> use case.
>
> A test case describes each task that will insure ASC X12 data

> Arrangements With Clearinghouses and Billing Services**\
> **(Rev. 3346, Issued: 09-04-15, Effective: 10-06-15, Implementation:
> 10-06-15)**
>
> A billing service is an entity that markets claim preparation services
> to providers and should also be able to perform related transactions
> for providers, such as eligibility and claim status inquiries. The
> billing service collects a provider's claim information and then bills
> the appropriate insurance companies, including Medicare. A billing
> service may submit claims only, or provide full financial accounting
> and/or other services.
>
> Billing services are considered to be provider business associates. As
> such, HIPAA requires that they comply with each of the privacy and
> security requirements that apply directly to providers. They are also
> required to ensure that they require that any\
> clearinghouses, subcontractors or other business associates of their
> own that may be involved with handling of Medicare beneficiary data
> also meet those same security and privacy requirements. A billing
> service may view beneficiary or provider data to carry out their
> billing obligations for a provider, when a provider authorizes them to
> have that access. To qualify as a billing service, an entity must at a
> minimum submit initial claims on the provider's behalf.
>
> A clearinghouse transfers or moves EDI transactions for a provider or
> billing service, and generally translates the EDI transactions from or
> into a proprietary format. (HIPAA defines a clearinghouse as a
> business associate of a provider or a health care plan that translates
> data from a non-standard format into a standard format or vice versa
> as preferred by their clients.) A clearinghouse generally accepts
> multiple types of incoming transactions and sends them to various
> payers, including Medicare. Clearinghouses often perform general and
> payer-specific edits on claims, and may handle multiple types of EDI
> transactions for a given provider. Clearinghouses frequently reformat
> data for various payers, and manage acknowledgments, remittance advice
> transactions, and claim status and eligibility queries.
>
> Some entities that refer to themselves as clearinghouses, however, do
> not edit or translate data, but simply serve as a "telecommunication
> switch," moving transactions from point A to Point B or wherever
> directed under the terms of the agreement with a provider. A
> clearinghouse may also be called a value added network (VAN). A
> clearinghouse/VAN may not view privacy-protected Medicare data unless
> a signed authorization has been filed by the provider for whom the
> clearinghouse/VAN will submit or received Medicare
>
> EDI transactions. For EDI, a transaction that contains individually
> identifiable information about a Medicare beneficiary is considered to
> be privacy protected data.
>
> That provider may not authorize submission or receipt of data by a
> third party for a Medicare beneficiary unless that beneficiary is a
> current patient of the provider, has scheduled an appointment, or has
> inquired about the receipt of supplies or services from the provider.
> The provider authorization must be filed with the Medicare contractor
> to whom EDI transactions will be sent or from whom they will be
> received. In the case of a DME claim, this authorization need only be
> submitted to CEDI. If multiple A/B MACs are involved, an authorization
> must be submitted to each.
>
> Each clearinghouse/VAN that will submit or receive Medicare EDI
> transactions is prohibited from using the EDI number or password
> issued to any of the providers they serve. Each clearinghouse/VAN must
> obtain its own EDI number and password from each A/B MAC with which it
> will interact. For, DME, each Clearinghouse/VAN must obtain its own
> EDI number and password from CEDI.
>
> Some health care providers use or may want to use more than one
> billing service or clearinghouse/VAN. An A/B MAC and CEDI ability to
> handle more than one agent varies. Some A/B MACs and CEDIs are able to
> accommodate one or more\
> clearinghouses/VAN for submission of a provider's claims to Medicare,
> another agent to receive the provider's remittance advice
> transactions, and a third clearinghouse/VAN to verify beneficiary
> Medicare eligibility for a provider. Others may not be able to
> accommodate more than one agent for a provider. A/B MACs and CEDIs
> are\
> encouraged to support more than one agent for a provider, when
> permitted by their front end configuration.

>
> Before selecting a vendor, the provider must examine its business
> needs to identify the EDI, practice management, or other services that
> the provider is interested in obtaining from a vendor. The provider
> should consider what services could be easily performed by their
> in-house staff and which might be more cost effective to obtain

>
> The provider should create a written description of the components of
> its practice that need vendor support and a description of support
> needed so prospective vendors can design their proposals to best meet
> the provider's needs. Requirements to consider include the following:
>
> •Future Growth of the Practice;\
> •Workload;\
> •Payer Analysis;\
> •Referral Tracking;\
> •Fee Schedules;\
> •Appointment Scheduling;\
> •Medical Records;\
> •Interconnections with Physicians/Hospitals and other Networks;\
> •Word Processing Needs;\
> •Electronic Billing (formats and versions supported);\

>
> Once a provider has determined its own goals and requirements, it must
> begin the vendor selection process. Selecting a vendor must be as
> objective and quantitative as possible. Areas to be evaluated should
> include technical functionality, flexibility, and customer service.
> The following steps may be used as guidelines for providers to start
> the vendor selection process:
>
> 1\. Develop a list of potential vendors:
>
> •Ask the Medicare A/B MACs and CEDI for a list of approved vendors;
>
> •Ask other providers of comparable size/specialties what vendors they
> use for what services and how satisfied they are;
>
> •Ask a consultant;\
> •Attend standards conferences, follow trade magazines and investigate
> Web pages. 2. Call or write the vendors selected/recommended to
> discuss the organization's needs and request a proposal.
>
> 3\. Tell the vendors how the proposals should be structured so that
> the various proposals can be more easily compared.
>
> 4\. Attend demonstrations of at least two to three vendors and pay
> close attention to: •How individual requirements will be met;\
> •Ease of understanding;\
> •Ease of features - data entry, search features, editing/compliance
> checking features, help features, error correction features;\
> •Security - disaster recovery plans, controls, and audits;\
> •Daily Procedures;\
> •Reporting/Tracking features.
>
> 5\. Check vendor references and ask specific questions such as: •How
> long has the business been in operation?
>
> •How long has the system been in place?
>
> •What is the quality of the training and ongoing support?
>
> •Is there a user's group in place?
>
> •What formats are supported?
>
> 6\. Check with providers served by the vendor and ask specific
> questions such as: •Have you experienced any problems with the system?
>
> •Have you experienced any problems with the vendor?
>
> •How long did it take to get up and running?
>
> •Are you happy with the system/vendor and would you recommend it/them
> today?
>
> •Is there anything else I should know or ask before making my
> decision?
>
> Make site visits to the vendor as well as other clients of similar
> size and bill mix that have been running the system for some time.

> **(Rev. 2803, Issued: 10-28-13, Effective: 09-17-13, Implementation:
> 09-17-13)**
>
> Vendor proposals should be evaluated on several levels including
> company\
> reputation/history, system functionality, flexibility, overall costs,
> and support provided.
>
> Providers should create a checklist that compares the vendor proposals
> against their original requirements by assigning a relative weight to
> each requirement and then rating the vendor's ability to meet each
> requirement based on their written proposals. Although some aspects of
> each checklist will be highly individual, the following are some of
> the elements that should be considered:
>
> 1\. Overall costs:
>
> •Software costs;\
> •Hardware costs (types as well as quality);\
> •Licensing fees;\
> •Training costs;\
> •Installation costs;\
> •Cabling;\
> •Phone lines (leased line/toll charges);\
> •Remodeling/Furniture;\
> •Forms;\
> •Conversion costs;\
> •Electricity costs;\
> •Supply costs\
> •Annual hardware maintenance;\
> •Annual software maintenance;\
> •Cost of custom program changes; and\
> •Cost of continuous software support.
>
> 2\. Evaluate hardware differences;
>
> 3\. Evaluate quality of training and support;
>
> 4\. Evaluate system documentation;
>
> 5\. Consider the staff size of the vendor;
>
> 6\. Determine how well each vendor responded to requirements and
> questions in the proposals;
>
> 7\. Determine flexibility (whether the package is proprietary, whether
> the software can be easily modified, whether the vendor can
> accommodate changing payer\
> requirements, and if so, at what cost);
>
> 8\. Determine overall system convenience including hours of customer
> service, technical support, and connection times;
>
> 9\. Assess future risks and the vendor mitigation of such risks
> through system trial periods and source codes placed in escrow.

>
> Once a vendor has been selected, the provider must negotiate the final
> costs, services, and implementation dates to be provided by the
> vendor. All agreements reached between the two parties should be
> obtained in writing. Providers should add a clause to their\

> **(Rev. 2803, Issued: 10-28-13, Effective: 09-17-13, Implementation:
> 09-17-13)**
>
> The CEM establishes consistent editing, acknowledgments, and error
> handling of the electronic data interchange (EDI) transactions across
> Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) jurisdictions. The CEM is
> implemented by each A/B MAC in their local data center (LDC). The Part
> A and Part B CEMs were developed by their corresponding Medicare
> Shared System Maintainers (SSMs). The Durable Medical Equipment (DME)
> MACs editing, acknowledgment, and error handling of EDI transactions
> is processed by the Common Electronic Data Interchange (CEDI)
> contractor. Each A/B MAC has integrated the CEM into its Front-End
> Systems for both inbound and outbound EDI transaction processing. The
> CEM, in conjunction with the A/B MAC Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS)
> translator and any additional Front End Solution, is responsible for
> editing current ASC X12 standard transactions established under HIPAA
> via Technical Report Type 3 (TR3s).
>
> The CEM provides submitters with quicker acknowledgments for the claim
> transaction(s) ASC X12 version(s) 005010 and beyond inclusive of any
> adopted errata under HIPAA.
>
> This allows submitters to correct any errors and resubmit their
> transactions without having to wait for a batch cycle.
>
> The CEM includes the following capabilities:
>
> •Code set editing
>
> •Medicare-specific editing
>
> •Duplicate submission checking
>
> •Claim Control Number assignment of Internal Control Number (ICN) or
> Document Control Number (DCN)
>
> •Creation of the ASC X12 277CA claim acknowledgment (flat file)
>
> •Creation of a CEM-edited transaction flat file
>
> •Receipt/Control/Balancing between the local data centers (LDCs) and
> EDCs for claims, claim status request and responses, and remittance
> advice
>
> •Reporting Capabilities based on the Control Record database
>
> **50.3.1 - Claim Numbering**\
> **(Rev. 2803, Issued: 10-28-13, Effective: 09-17-13, Implementation:
> 09-17-13)**
>
> The CEM will assign a claim control number to each accepted claim. An
> accepted claim is a unit of work, 2300 loop followed by a 2400 loop,
> as described in the ASC X12 837 claim TR3 that has passed all
> translator syntax/semantic and CEM Medicare business edits and has
> been assigned a claim control number. The assigned claim control
> number will be reported back to the submitter via the ASC X12 277CA
> claim acknowledgment. This will provide the submitter with the claim
> control number earlier in the adjudication process, thus enabling the
> submitter to perform more specific claim status inquiries on
> individual claims instead of entire submissions via standard HIPAA
> adopted transactions or via traditional IVR/ARU (Interactive Voice
> Response/Automated Response Unit methods.
>
> **50.3.2 - Receipt Control and Balancing**\
> **(Rev. 2803, Issued: 10-28-13, Effective: 09-17-13, Implementation:
> 09-17-13)**
>
> Upon receiving an ASC X12 276 claim status request or ASC X12 837
> claim\
> (institutional or professional)current standard transaction adopted
> under HIPAA, the A/B MAC will process the file through their Front End
> EDI solution, composed of at minimum a COTS translator. The COTS
> translator creates the appropriate CMS defined flat file, based on
> transaction type. The CMS defined flat file will include a skeleton
> Control Record, either a Detail Record (CTRD) or a Resubmission Record
> (CTRR), for each Interchange Control Header/Interchange Control
> Trailer (ISA/IEA) present, and the A/B MAC then loads/places this file
> into the designated folder for the CEM to pick up and process.
>
> The CTRD/CTRR record is placed in the designated transaction outbound
> folder for the A/B MAC LDC to move via Network Data Mover (NDM) to the
> EDC. The EDC will run a receipt/control/balancing process upon receipt
> of a file to ensure that what was sent by the LDC is what the EDC
> received. Once the EDCs have checked the files, the "Received" portion
> of the Control Records will be populated, and a copy of the Control
> Record shall be sent back to the LDC and logged in the Control Record
> database. If the file balances, the Control Records will be stripped
> off and the file will be queued up to be pulled in to the next
> processing cycle. If file does not balance, "Received" portion of the
> Control Records will be populated, and a copy of the Control Record
> shall be sent back to
>
> the LDC and logged in the Control Record database. An alert will be
> sent to the LDC to indicate there is a problem with a file, and the
> bad ISA/IEA will be stripped out of the file. Once the LDC has
> identified and fixed the issues, they resubmit the bad ISA/IEA.
>
> The Receipt/Control/Balancing process will also be in place for the
> outbound ASC X12 835 remittance advice and the ASC X12 277 claim
> status response. The shared system maintainers (SSMs) will create the
> appropriate CMS defined flat file, based on\
> transaction type. The CMS defined flat file will include the Control
> Records. The transactions will be sent to the MAC/CEDI local data
> center, where they will be passed through the
> receipt/control/balancing process to ensure if the CMS defined flat
> file is balanced. During the outbound translation process the A/B MACs
> shall remove the control records prior to translating the CMS defined
> flat files to ASC X12 EDI format.

> **(Rev. 2803, Issued: 10-28-13, Effective: 09-17-13, Implementation:
> 09-17-13)**
>
> HIPAA does not require, but does permit payers to maintain DDE screens
> for claim submission, correction, claim status determination, and
> eligibility verification. A/B MACs (A) are required to maintain claim
> submission, claim correction and claim status screens, but not A/B
> MACs (B) or DME MACs. This section is applicable to claim entry and
> claims correction (see chapter 31 for DDE requirements for formats
> other than claims).
>
> Medicare considers transactions conducted via DDE screens to meet
> HIPAA-compliancy requirements. DDE claims are considered
> HIPAA-compliant EDI transactions for application of the 14-day payment
> floor.
>
> Data entered via DDE screens are not subject to the syntax (format)
> requirements of the standards, but must meet "applicable data content"
> requirements for comparable HIPAA transactions. A/B MACs (A) may
> continue to use existing DDE screens for claim
>
> corrections since this function is not subject to HIPAA. DDE systems
> are proprietary by definition. They are a direct link between a
> particular health plan (Medicare) and its providers, and the software
> (and sometimes hardware) is unique to and maintained by the plan. The
> widespread use of the standard HIPAA transactions should make it\
> economically feasible for more providers to procure or develop their
> own EDI products that can be used with all plans. The use of DDE
> should decrease over time as a result.
>
> The requirement for "applicable data content" is meant to facilitate
> that eventual conversion. Adopting the data content requirements of
> HIPAA in DDE screens will facilitate eventual migration of providers
> from DDE to use of EDI transaction software (or to use of a
> clearinghouse). This will also permit maintenance of DDE-generated
> data and HIPAA standard transaction-generated data in the same
> databases.
>
> In this context, "applicable data content" means shared
> system-maintained DDE screens must:
>
> •Collect all data elements that are required in the IG as well as
> those situational elements that are needed for Medicare processing
> (unless the data is already available to the payer's system);
>
> •Use only the internal and external code sets designated in the HIPAA
> standard TR3 with no additions or substitutions;
>
> •Provide for at least the field size minimums noted in the IG, but no
> more than the maximum sizes (Do not expand the size of a shared
> system's internal claim records);
>
> •Permit at least the minimum number of field repeats noted in the IG,
> but no more than the maximum number;
>
> •Allow for only one investigational device exemption number (IDE) per
> claim (at the claim level);
>
> •Remove employment status code, employer name, and employer address
> information;
>
> •Allow Other Subscriber Demographic Information (date of birth and
> gender) if the other subscriber is a person;
>
> •Allow for discharge hour and minute information in the numeric form
> of HHMM; and
>
> •Allow for correct processing of the unique physicians identifier
> number in the 2310A (Attending Physician) loop.
>
> Data elements not used by-Medicare are not currently collected in
> Medicare DDE screens. Claims correction via DDE should be limited to
> Medicare data (non-Medicare
>
> data in error should be purged with an appropriate error message to
> the DDE user). With Medicare data plus some information from shared
> system files, an IG compliant COB transaction can be written.

>
> The PWK segment is the "electronic staple" which connects paper

>
> Providers that wish to utilize the PWK process to submit their
> additional documentation will be required to use a specially designed
> cover sheet which will be provided to them by their servicing A/B
> MACs, or DME MACs. Contact your servicing A/B MACs or DME MACs for
> details on how/where to obtain the cover sheet. These cover sheets
> will be required to be completely and accurately filled out or they
> will be manually returned. It is important to note that the A/B MACs
> or DME MACs is not required to return your
>
> additional documentation along with the cover sheet. In the instance
> where the coversheet is returned due to inaccurate or incomplete
> information, the claim will be adjudicated according to the normal CMS
> business policies and procedures without regard for the additional
> documentation received.
>
> When submitting an electronic claim, the submitter must indicate in
> the body of the electronic claim their intention to submit additional
> documentation (at the claim level, line level, or both) along with
> their claim. This is done by indicating the following in the
> electronic claim: the PWK elements PWK01 (attachment type), PWK02
> (transmission method), PWK05 (the value AC), and PWK06 (a 1-50 byte
> attachment control number \[ACN\] of the provider/claim submitter's
> choosing). PWK data submitted at the claim level will apply to the
> whole claim, unless overridden at the detail line level. Line level
> PWK data will only apply to that particular detail line of the claim.
> Electronic claims submitted with an improperly formatted PWK segment
> will be rejected back to the submitter via either an ASC X12 277CA
> claim acknowledgment or an ASC X12 999 implementation acknowledgment
> depending on the nature and location of the error. Although the ASC
> X12 837 claim transaction allows for up to 10 iterations of the PWK at
> both the claim and line level, only the first iteration of the PWK
> segment will be utilized for claim adjudication. Additional iterations
> of the PWK segment beyond one will be stored by the claims processing
> contractor to which the claim was submitted.
>
> Once the electronic claim has been submitted with the PWK,
> provider/claim submitters are expected to submit their additional
> documentation as soon as possible. Providers will be required to
> either fax or mail their additional documentation to the A/B MACs or
> DME MACs. The only exception will be for those A/B MACs or DME MACs
> which are part of an approved CMS electronic attachment pilot. In that
> case, your A/B MACs or DME MACs will notify you of other acceptable
> methods for submitting your additional documentation. As a rule, the
> provider/claim submitter is required to provide the\
> additional documentation within 7 calendar days, if utilizing fax, or
> within 10 calendar days, if utilizing mail. After the 7/10 day waiting
> period expires, the claim will be adjudicated according to the normal

>
> When A/B MACs and DME MACs staff encounters an edit or an audit within

> comply with data element requirements added by the IG developers,
> using either software available from FISS or other software which is
> able to edit at this level. A/B MAC (B) shared systems conduct IG
> edits for transactions sent to the A/B MACs (B). CEDI conducts IG
> edits for transactions sent to the DME MACs.
>
> In many cases, IG edits are more restrictive than those established by
> the ASC X12 standard that served as the platform for development of
> the TR3. For instance, the ASC X12 standard might allow a maximum of
> 30-digits in a data element, but an IG note could limit the maximum
> size to 20-digits. Or the number of valid digits that may be entered
> in a data element as identified by the qualifiers that apply to the
> data element, might not permit reporting of more than 15-digits even
> though the standard permits up to 30-digits.
>
> No national standards have been adopted under HIPAA for acknowledgment
> or error reporting for any of the HIPAA format transactions. However,
> Medicare has adopted the ASC X12 999 implementation acknowledgment and
> ASC X12 277CA claim\
> acknowledgment for this purpose effective with the implementation of

> proprietary error reporting for CMN rejection reports, which are
> returned to DME submitters through CEDI. IG and Medicare program error
> reports related to electronic transactions must be sent to the
> submitters of those transactions electronically. IG level edits
> typically affect a small number of the transactions in a batch.
> Whenever not precluded by the standard, A/B MACs and CEDI are expected
> to reject individual transactions that are identified via IG edits and
> not reject the entire batch of transactions in which those
> transactions were submitted.

>
> Once a provider begins to receive Medicare payments via EFT, the A/B

> provider via check. (For purposes of this instruction, the term
> "routine, ongoing payments" means those payments that are not
> considered to be "special payments," as that latter term is used in
> section 4 of the CMS-855 application.) This means, therefore, that -
> with the exception of special payments - a provider that receives
> payments via EFT must continue to receive payments via EFT and cannot
> switch back to receiving paper checks, even in cases of a MAC
> transition or other CMS-initiated action. A/B MACs and DME MACs shall
> not approve any requests to change the provider's payment method from
> EFT to check.
>
> Note that the A/B MAC or DME MAC shall abide by the instructions in
> Pub. 100-08, chapter 10, sections 4.4 and 8 on all provider enrollment
> issues relating to EFT. This includes the requirement that A/B MACs

> Form-CMS-588 (Electronic Funds Transfer Authorization Agreement), to
> that on the provider's CMS-855 form on file. For changes of\
> information, DME MACs shall verify the authorized official on the CMS
> 855.
>
> An A/B MAC or DME MAC shall use a transmission format that is both
> economical and compatible with the servicing bank. If the money is
> traveling separately from an ASC X12 835 remittance advice
> transaction, then A/B MACs and DME MACs shall use National Automated
> Clearinghouse Association (NACHA) format CCP (Cash\
> Concentration/Disbursement plus Addenda -CCD+) to make sure that the

> **A. NCPDP Batch Transaction**
>
> The NCPDP batch transaction format is intended to provide a file
> transmission standard for submission in a non-real-time mode of the
> telecommunications standard transaction for drug claims from retail
> pharmacies. CEDI will not accept retail pharmacy drug claims that are
> not submitted as batch transactions.
>
> NCPDP users are required to transmit National Drug Codes (NDCs) in the
> NCPDP standard for identification of prescription drugs dispensed
> through a retail pharmacy. NDCs replace the drug HCPCS codes for
> retail pharmacy drug transactions submitted to CEDI and delivered to
> the DME MACs via the NCPDP standard. The DME MAC shared system (VMS)
> will convert NDCs to HCPCS codes for internal claim processing. The
> CMS will provide the HCPCS codes for these drugs and an NDC to HCPCS
> crosswalk for use by VMS and the DME MACs.
>
> **B. Generating a Batch NCPDP Response**
>
> CEDI will return the NCPDP batch response for all NCPDP transmissions
> received. The NCPDP term "transaction" is equivalent to a Medicare
> service or line item and the NCPDP term "transmission" is equivalent
> to a Medicare claim. The NCPDP\
> implementation guide allows for up to 4 transactions (line items) per
> transmission
>
> (claim). This means that each claim can have up to 4 line items.
> Therefore, if one transaction (line item) rejects, the entire
> transmission (claim) will be returned. All transactions (up to 4) in
> the transmission will be treated as one claim, and each transmission
> in a batch will be treated as a separate claim. For a transmission
> (claim) where one or more claim transactions (lines) have errors, the
> following will occur:
>
> 1.CEDI will reject all claim transactions (line items) in the
> transmission (claim) if any one claim (transmission) has detail
> errors.
>
> 2.The response status for all transactions will equal R (rejected).
>
> 3.CEDI will send up to 5 reject codes for claim transactions (line
> items) that have detail errors.
>
> 4.No transaction level reject code will be reflected for the line item
> with no error. Instead, the 504-F4 response message field at the
> header level is being used to denote acceptance or rejection of the
> entire claim.
>
> **C. NCPDP Implementation Guide (IG) Edits**
>
> CEDI shall allow segments to be submitted in any order including AM07,
> AM03 and AM11 as permitted by the NCPDP standard. CEDI must create the
> NCPDP flat file segments in numeric order for receipt by the DME MACs
> shared system maintainer.
>
> **D. Misdirected Claims**
>
> With the implementation of CEDI, there are no longer "mis-directed"
> claims. CEDI receives all DME ASC X12 and NCPDP claims, performs all
> front end editing and translation. Claims accepted by CEDI are
> assigned the Claim Control Number and delivered to the appropriate DME

> A "small provider" is defined at 42 CFR section 424.32(d)(1)(vii) to
> mean A) a provider of services (as that term is defined in section
> 1861(u) of the Social Security Act) with fewer than 25 full-time
> equivalent (FTE) employees; or B) a physician, practitioner, facility
> or supplier that is not otherwise a provider under section 1861(u)

> physicians, practitioners, facilities, or suppliers with fewer than 10
> FTEs and that are required to bill a A/B MAC (B) or DME MAC to be
> small.
>
> The ASCA law and regulation do not modify pre-existing laws or
> employer policies defining full time employment. Each employer has an
> established policy, subject to certain non-Medicare State and Federal
> regulations, that define the number of hours employees must work on
> average on a weekly, biweekly, monthly, or other basis to qualify for
> full-time benefits. Some employers do not grant full-timebenefits
> until an employee works an average of 40 hours a week, whereas another
> employer might consider an employee who works an average of 32 hours a
> week to be eligible for full-time benefits. An employee who works an
> average of 40 hours a week would always be considered full time, but
> employees who work a lesser number of hours weekly on average could
> also be considered full time according to the policy of a specific
> employer.
>
> Everyone on staff for whom a health care provider withholds taxes and
> files reports with the Internal (Revenue Service (IRS) using an
> Employer Identification Number (EIN) is considered an employee,
> including if applicable, a physician(s) who owns a practice and
> provides hands on services and those support staff who do not furnish
> health care services but do retain records of, perform billing for,
> order supplies related to, provide personnel services for, and
> otherwise perform support services to enable the provider to function.
>
> Unpaid volunteers are not employees. Individuals who perform services
> for a provider under contract, such as individuals employed by a
> billing agency or medical placement service, for whom a provider does
> not withhold taxes, are not considered members of a provider's staff
> for FTE calculation purposes when determining whether a provider can
> be considered as "small" for electronic billing waiver purposes.
>
> Medical staff sometimes work part time, or may work full time but
> their time is split among multiple providers. Part time employee hours
> must also be counted when determining the number of FTEs employed by a
> provider. For example, if a provider has a policy that anyone who
> works at least 35 hours per week on average qualifies for full-time
> benefits, and has 5 full-time employees and 7 part-time employees,
> each of whom works 25 hours a week, that provider would have 10 FTEs
> (5+\[7 x 25= 175 divided by 35= 5\]).
>
> In some cases, the EIN of a parent company may be used to file
> employee tax reports for multiple providers under multiple provider
> numbers. In that instance, it is acceptable to consider only those
> staff, or staff hours worked for a particular provider (National
> Provider Identifier (NPI)) to calculate the number of FTEs employed by
> that provider.
>
> For example, ABC Health Care Company owns hospital, home health agency
> (HHA), ambulatory surgical center (ASC), and durable medical equipment
> (DME) subsidiaries. Some of those providers may bill A/B MACs or DME
> MACs. All have separate provider numbers but the tax records for all
> employees are reported under the same EIN to the IRS. There is a
> company policy that staff must work an average of 40 hours a week to
> qualify for full time benefits.
>
> Some of the same staff split hours between the hospital and the ASC,
> or between the DME and HHA subsidiaries. To determine total FTEs by
> provider number, it is acceptable to base the calculation on the
> number of hours each staff member contributes to the support of each
> separate provider by provider number. First, each provider would need
> to determine the number of staff who work on a full-time basis under a
> single provider number only; do not count more than 40 hours a week
> for these employees.
>
> Then each provider would need to determine the number of part-time
> hours a week worked on average by all staff who furnished services
> forthe provider on a less thanfull-time basis. Divide that total by 40
> hours to determine their full-time equivalent total. If certain staff
> members regularly work an average of 60 hours per week, but their time
> is divided 50 hours to the hospital and 10 hours to the ASC, for FTE
> calculation purposes, it is acceptable to consider the person as 1 FTE
> for the hospital and .25 FTE for the ASC.
>
> In some cases, a single provider number and EIN may be assigned, but
> the entity's primary mission is not as a health care provider. For
> instance, a grocery store's primary
>
> role is the retail sale of groceries and ancillary items including

> of their employees are not involved with\
> prescription drugs or DME and concentrate on non-related departments
> of the store, such as film development, cosmetics, electronics,
> cleaning supplies, etc. A county government uses the same EIN for all
> county employees but their health care provider services are limited
> to furnishing of emergency medical care and ambulance transport to
> residents. For FTE calculation purposes, it is acceptable to include
> only those staff members of the grocery store, drug store, or county
> involved with or that support the provision of health care in the FTE

> Support staff who should be included in the FTE calculation in these

>
> It has been determined that due to limitations in the claims
> transaction formats adopted for national use under HIPAA, it would not
> be possible in some cases to submit certain claims to Medicare
> electronically. Providers are to self-assess to determine if they meet
> these exceptions. At the present time, only the following claim types

>
> 1\. [Roster billing of inoculations covered by
> Medicare]{.underline}-Although flu shots and similar covered vaccines
> and their administration can be billed to Medicare electronically, one
> claim for one beneficiary at a time, some suppliers have been
> permitted to submit a single claim on paper with the basic provider
> and service data and to attach a list of the Medicare beneficiaries to
> whom the vaccine was administered and related identification
> information for those beneficiaries. This is referred to as roster
> billing. The claim IGs adopted under HIPAA provide for submission of
> single claims to a payer for single individuals, but cannot be used to
> submit a roster bill for multiple individuals.
>
> Flu and pneumonia inoculations are often administered in senior
> citizen centers, grocery stores, malls, and other locations in the
> field. It is not always reasonable or hygienic to use a laptop
> computer to register all necessary data to enable a HIPAA-compliant
> claim to be submitted electronically in such field situations,
> particularly when a single individual is responsible for collection of
> the data and administration of the inoculations. Due to the low cost
> of these vaccinations, it is not always cost effective to obtain all
> of the data normally needed for preparation of a HIPAA-compliant
> claim. Such suppliers rarely have a long-term health care relationship
> with their patients and do not have a need for the extensive medical
> and personal history routinely collected in most other health care
> situations.
>
> It is in the interest of Medicare and public health to make it as
> simple as possible for mass inoculation activities to continue.
> Although suppliers are encouraged to submit these claims to Medicare
> electronically, one claim for one beneficiary at a time, this is not
> required except in the case of multi-state companies that signed an
> agreement with a single Medicare contractor for submission of all flu
> shots to that single contractor for those states, and who agreed to
> submit those claims\
> electronically as a condition for centralized billing of those
> inoculations. In the absence of an electronic format that would allow
> a single claim for the same service to be submitted on behalf of
> multiple patients using abbreviated data, suppliers currently allowed
> to submit paper roster bills may continue to submit paper roster bills
> for inoculations.
>
> This inoculation waiver applies only to injections such as flu shots
> frequently furnished in non-traditional medical situations, and does
> not apply to injections including flu shots when furnished in a
> traditional medical setting such as a doctor's office or an outpatient
> clinic as a component of other medical care or an
>
> examination. In traditional medical situations where the provider is
> required to bill the other services furnished to the patient
> electronically, a flu shot or other\
> inoculation is also to be included in the electronic claim sent to
> Medicare for the patient.

> 2\. [Claims for payment under a Medicare demonstration project that

> demonstration projects test something not previously done, such as
> coverage of a new service. As a result of the novelty, the code set

>
> Providers that submit paper claims to multiple Medicare MACs,

>
> billing the RRB SMAC. These letters have now been modified to note

> provider does not qualify to submit claims on paper also applies to
> that same provider when billing other Medicare MACs, including the RRB
> SMAC. Two letters (G and H) have been added specifically for RRB SMAC
> use. Letters G and H may not be sent by and do not apply to any
> contractor other than the RRB SMAC.
>
> The ASCA regulation indicated that denial of claims because they were
> not submitted to Medicare electronically would be applied on a
> prospective basis. Ninety days is being allowed prior to denial in
> letters G and H to allow time for those providers that do not have
> software for submission of electronic claims to the RRB SMAC to obtain
> that software from their vendor. Addition of a RRB SMAC module to some
> commercial electronic claim submission software can reportedly be
> expensive. As result, wording has also been included in the letters
> concerning the Medicare free billing software.
>
> The cost charged by a commercial software vendor for a module to
> enable claims to be submitted to the RRB SMAC electronically is not a
> valid basis for waiver of the\
> requirement that a provider submit their claims to the RMC
> electronically. The RRB SMAC shall encourage a provider who may
> mention cost to use the RMC's free billing software if this would be a
> more cost effective method of electronic submission of their claims to
> the RRB SMAC. The provider shall use either the commercial software of
> their choice or the Medicare free billing software and shall begin to
> submit their claims to the RRB SMAC electronically if they wish to
> continue to be paid for services furnished to RR Medicare
> beneficiaries.
>
> The ASCA Enforcement Review letters now refer to an ASCA electronic
> claim\
> submission requirement made by one MAC as applying to all MACs because
> that is actually how ASCA decisions are to be applied. CMS has not
> enforced this across the board due to the lack of a vehicle for

>
> You recently began to treat one or more Railroad Medicare

> the process of establishing a record in our files to indicate that you
> are eligible to submit Medicare claims, we obtained a copy of your
> non-RR Medicare enrollment information. That record indicates that you

>
> (ASCA), Pub.L.107-105, and the implementing regulation at 42 CFR

> be made under Part A or Part B of the Medicare Program for any
> expenses incurred for items or services" for which a claim is
> submitted in a non-electronic form.
>
> ASCA did not differentiate among Medicare contractors or between
> Railroad and non-Railroad Medicare for application of the electronic
> claim submission requirement or exceptions to that requirement. As
> result, we will begin to deny any paper claims you submit to us for
> Railroad Medicare beneficiaries unless you are able to establish that
> you meet one or more of the following exceptions to this ASCA
> requirement:
>
> 1\. Claims submitted by small providers\-- To qualify, a physician,
> practitioner, or supplier required to use a CMS-1500 form in a current
> version when submitting claims on paper shall have fewer than 10
> full-time equivalent employees (FTEs).
>
> A small provider can elect to submit all, some or none of their claims
> electronically;
>
> 2\. Dental claims;
>
> 3\. Claims submitted by participants in a Medicare demonstration
> project for services or items covered under that demonstration project
> when paper claim filing is required as result of the inability of the
> HIPAA claim implementation guide to handle data essential for that
> demonstration;
>
> 4\. Roster claims for mass immunizations, such as flu or pneumonia
> injections\--Paper roster bills cover multiple beneficiaries on the
> same claim. This exception applies to providers who do not have an
> agreement in place with a Medicare contractor that commits them to
> electronic submission of mass immunization claims;
>
> 5\. Claims sent to Medicare when more than one other insurer was
> liable for payment prior to Medicare;
>
> 6\. Claims submitted by providers that rarely treat Medicare patients
> and that submit fewer than 10 claims a month to Medicare in total
> (total of all claims sent to all Medicare contractors including the
> RRB Specialty Medicare Administrative Contractor );
>
> 7\. Claims submitted by beneficiaries;

8\. Claims from providers that only furnish services outside of the
United States;

> 9\. Claims from providers experiencing a disruption in their
> electricity or\
> communication connection that is outside of their control and is
> expected to last longer than two days. This exception applies only
> while electricity or electronic communication is disrupted; and
>
> 10\. Providers that can establish that some other "unusual
> circumstance" exists that precludes submission of claims
> electronically.
>
> The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) interprets an
> "unusual\
> circumstance" to be a temporary or long-term situation outside of a
> provider's control that precludes submission of claims electronically
> and as result, it would be against equity and good conscience for CMS
> to require claims affected by the circumstance to be submitted
> electronically. Examples of "unusual circumstances" include:
>
> a\. Periods when a Medicare contractor's claim system might
> temporarily reject a particular type of electronically submitted
> claim, pending system modifications (individual Medicare claims
> processing contractors notify their providers of these situations if
> they apply);
>
> b\. Documented disability of each employee of a provider prevents use
> of a computer to enable electronic submission of claims;
>
> c\. Entities that can demonstrate that information necessary for
> adjudication of a type of Medicare claim that does not involve a
> medical record or other claim attachment cannot be submitted
> electronically using the claim formats adopted under the Health
> Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); and
>
> d\. Other circumstances documented by a provider, generally in rare
> cases, where a provider can establish that, due to conditions outside
> of the provider's control, it would be against equity and good
> conscience for CMS to enforce the electronic claim submission
> requirement.
>
> If you intend to continue to submit paper claims, please respond
> within 30 calendar days of the date of this letter to indicate which
> of the above situations is your basis for continuing submission of
> paper claims to us. Include with your response, evidence to establish
> that you qualify for waiver of the electronic filing requirement under
> that situation. For instance, if you are a small provider, evidence
> might consist of copies of payroll records for all of your employees
> for (specify the start and end dates of the calendar quarter for which
> the review is being conducted) that list the number of hours each
> worked during that quarter. If you are a dentist, evidence might be a
> copy of your license.
>
> If you are in a Medicare demonstration project, evidence might be a
> copy of your notification of acceptance into that demonstration. If
> you are a mass immunizer, evidence might be a schedule of immunization
> locations that indicates the types of immunizations furnished. If you
> experienced an extended disruption in communication or electrical
> services, evidence might consist of a copy of a newspaper clipping
> addressing the outage. If the paper claims were submitted because this
> office notified you of a system problem preventing submission of these
> claims electronically, please note that in your response.
>
> If your continuing submission of paper claims is the result of medical
> restrictions that prevent your staff from submitting electronic
> claims, evidence would consist of\
> documentation from providers other than yourself to substantiate the
> medical conditions.
>
> If you obtained an unusual circumstance waiver, evidence would be a
> copy of your notification to that effect from this office or the
> Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
>
> Providers that received waivers for a specific claim type are still
