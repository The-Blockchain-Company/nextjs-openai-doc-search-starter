> This form, also known as the UB-04, is a uniform institutional
> provider bill suitable for use in billing multiple third party payers.
> Because it serves many payers, a particular payer may not need some
> data elements. The National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC) maintains
> lists of approved coding for the form. Medicare Administrative
> Contractors servicing both Part A and Part B lines of business (A/B
> MACs (A) and (HHH)) responsible for receiving institutional claims
> also maintain lists of codes used by Medicare. All items on Form
> CMS-1450 are described. The A/B MAC (A) or (HHH) must be able to
> capture all NUBC-approved input data described in section 75 for audit
> trail purposes and be able to pass coordination of benefits data to
> other payers with whom it has a coordination of benefits agreement.

> The provider retains the copy designated "Institution Copy" and
> submits the remaining copies of the completed Form CMS-1450 to its A/B
> MAC (A) or (HHH), managed care plan, or other insurer. Where it knows
> that a managed care plan will pay the bill, it sends the bill and any
> necessary supporting documentation directly to the managed care plan
> for coverage determination, payment, and/or denial action. It sends to
> the A/B MAC (A) or (HHH) bills that it knows will be paid and
> processed by the A/B MAC (A) or (HHH).

> This section contains Medicare requirements for use of codes
> maintained by the NUBC that are needed in completion of the Form
> CMS-1450 and compliant Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12 837
> institutional claims. **Note that the internal claim record used for
> processing is not being expanded.** Instructions for completion are
> the same for inpatient and outpatient claims unless otherwise noted.
> The A/B MAC (A) or (HHH) does not need to search paper files to
> annotate missing data unless it does not have an electronic history
> record. It does not need to obtain data that is not needed to process
> the claim.
>
> Effective June 5, 2000, CMS extended the claim size to 450 lines. For
> the Form CMS-1450, this simply means that the A/B MAC (A) or (HHH)
> accepts claims of up to 9 pages. The following layout describes the
> data specifications Form CMS-1450.

> Occurrence Codes to be utilized. With respect to Occurrence Codes,
> complete field 31a - 34a (line level) before the "b" fields.
> Occurrence and Occurrence Span codes are mutually exclusive. An
> example of Occurrence Code use: A Medicare beneficiary was confined in
> hospital from January 1, 2005 to January 10, 2005, however, his
> Medicare Part A benefits were exhausted as of January 8, 2005, and he
> was not entitled to Part B benefits. Therefore, Form Locator 31 should
> contain code A3 and the date 010805.
>
> The provider enters code(s) and associated date(s) defining specific
> event(s) relating to this billing period. Event codes are two
> alpha-numeric digits, and dates are six numeric digits (MMDDYY). When
> occurrence codes 01-04 and 24 are entered, the provider must make sure
> the entry includes the appropriate value code in FLs 39-41, if there
> is another payer involved. Occurrence and occurrence span codes are
> mutually exclusive. When FLs 36 A and B are fully used with occurrence
> span codes, FLs 34a and 34b and 35a and 35b may be used to contain the
> "From" and "Through" dates of other occurrence span codes. In this
> case, the code in FL 34 is the occurrence span code and the occurrence
> span "From" dates is in the date field. FL 35 contains the same
> occurrence span code as the code in FL 34, and the occurrence span
> "Through" date is in the date field. Other payers may require other
> codes, and while Medicare does not use them, they may be entered on
> the bill if convenient.

> (OSCs) Apply to a Single Stay**
>
> The Long Term Care Hospital (LTCH), Inpatient Psychiatric Facility
> (IPF), and Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) Prospective Payment
> Systems (PPSs) requires a single claim to be billed for an entire
> stay. Interim claims may be submitted to continually adjust all prior
> submitted claims for the stay until the beneficiary is discharged. In
> some instances, significantly long stays having numerous OSCs may
> exceed the amount of OSCs allowed to be billed on a claim.
>
> When a provider paid under the LTCH, IPF or IRF PPSs encounters a
> situation in which ten or more OSCs are to be billed on the claim, the
> provider must bill for the entire stay up to the Through date of the
> 10th OSC for the stay (the Through date for the Statement Covers
> Period equals the Through date of the tenth OSC). As the stay
> continues, the provider must only bill the 11th through the 20th OSC
> for the stay, if applicable. Once the twentieth OSC is applied to the
> claim, the provider must only bill the 21st through the 30th OSC for
> the stay, if applicable. The Shared System Maintainers (SSMs) retain
> the history of all OSCs billed for the stay to ensure proper
> processing (i.e., as if no OSC limitation exists on the claim).

> codes for instructions.
>
> If more than one value code is shown for a billing period, codes are
> shown in ascending numeric sequence. There are four lines of data,

>
> Additionally, there is no fixed "Total" line in the charge area. The

> summed. To assist in bill review, the provider must list revenue codes
> in ascending numeric sequence and not repeat on the same bill to the

> **FL 44 - HCPCS/Rates/HIPPS Rate Codes**
>
> **Required.** When coding HCPCS for outpatient services, the provider
> enters the HCPCS code describing the procedure here. On inpatient
> hospital bills the accommodation rate is shown here.
>
> HCPCS used for Medicare claims are available from Medicare
> contractors.
>
> **Health Insurance Prospective Payment System** (**HIPPS**) **Rate
> Codes**
>
> The HIPPS rate code consists of the three-character resource
> utilization group (RUG) code that is obtained from the "Grouper"
> software program followed by a 2-digit assessment indicator (AI) that
> specifies the type of assessment associated with the RUG code obtained
> from the Grouper. SNFs must use the version of the Grouper software
> program identified by CMS for national PPS as described in the Federal
> Register for that year. The Grouper translates the data in the Long
> Term Care Resident Instrument into a case mix group and assigns the
> correct RUG code. The AIs were developed by CMS.
>
> The Grouper will not automatically assign the 2-digit AI, except in
> the case of a swing bed MDS that is will result in a special payment
> situation AI (see below). The HIPPS rate codes that appear on the
> claim must match the assessment that has been transmitted and accepted
> by the State in which the facility operates. The SNF cannot put a
> HIPPS rate code on the claim that does not match the assessment.
>
> HIPPS Rate Codes used for Medicare claims are available from Medicare
> contractors. *As of October 1, 2019, SNF PDPM changes are effective
> (see §§120ff. in Chapter 6 of this manual).*
>
> **HIPPS Modifiers/Assessment Type Indicators**
>
> The assessment indicators (AI) were developed by CMS to identify on
> the claim, which of the scheduled Medicare assessments or off-cycle
> assessments is associated with the assessment reference date and the
> RUG that is included on the claim for payment of Medicare SNF
> services. In addition, the AIs identify the Effective Date for the
> beginning of the covered period and aid in ensuring that the number of
> days billed for each\
> scheduled Medicare assessment or off cycle assessment accurately
> reflect the changes in the beneficiary\'s status over time. The
> indicators were developed by utilizing codes for the reason for
> assessment contained in section AA8 of the current version of the
> Resident Assessment Instrument, Minimum Data Set in order to ease the
> reporting of such information. Follow the CMS manual instructions for
> appropriate assignment of the assessment codes.

> **HCPCS Modifiers (Level I and Level II)**
>
> Form CMS-1450 accommodates up to four modifiers, two characters each.
> See AMA publication CPT 20xx (xx= to current year) Current Procedural
> Terminology Appendix A - HCPCS Modifiers Section: "Modifiers Approved
> for Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) Hospital Outpatient Use". Various
> CPT (Level I HCPCS) and Level II HCPCS codes may require the use of
> modifiers to improve the accuracy of coding. Consequently,
> reimbursement, coding consistency, editing and proper payment will
> benefit from the reporting of modifiers. Hospitals should not report a
> separate HCPCS (five-digit code) instead of the modifier. When
> appropriate, report a modifier based on the list indicated in the
> above section of the AMA publication.
>
> HCPCS modifiers used for Medicare claims are available from Medicare
> contractors.
>
> **FL 45 - Service Date**
>
> **Required** Outpatient. CMHCs and hospitals (with the exception of
> CAHs, Indian Health Service hospitals and hospitals located in
> American Samoa, Guam and Saipan) report line
>
> item dates of service on all bills containing revenue codes, procedure
> codes or drug codes. This includes claims where the "from" and
> "through" dates are equal. This change is due to a HIPAA requirement.
>
> There must be a single line item date of service (LIDOS) for every
> iteration of every revenue code on all outpatient bills (TOBs 013X,
> 014X, 023X, 024X, 032X, 033X, 034X, 071X, 072X, 073X, 074X, 075X,

> on inpatient Part B bills (TOBs 012x and 022x). If a particular
> service is rendered 5 times during the billing period, the revenue
> code and HCPCS code must be entered 5 times, once for each service
> date.
>
> **FL 46 - Units of Service**
>
> **Required**. Generally, the entries in this column quantify services
> by revenue code category, e.g., number of days in a particular type of
> accommodation, pints of blood. However, when HCPCS codes are required
> for services, the units are equal to the number of times the
> procedure/service being reported was performed.
>
> The provider enters up to seven numeric digits. It shows charges for
> noncovered services as noncovered, or omits them. **NOTE:** Hospital
> outpatient departments report the number of visits/sessions when
> billing under the partial hospitalization program.
>
> **FL 47 - Total Charges - Not Applicable for Electronic Billers**
>
> **Required**. This is the FL in which the provider sums the total
> charges for the billing period for each revenue code (FL 42); or, if
> the services require, in addition to the revenue center code, a HCPCS
> procedure code, where the provider sums the total charges for the
> billing period for each HCPCS code. The last revenue code entered in
> FL 42 is "0001" which represents the grand total of all charges
> billed. The amount for this code, as for all others is entered in FL
> 47. Each line for FL 47 allows up to nine numeric digits (0000000.00).
> The CMS policy is for providers to bill Medicare on the same basis
> that they bill other payers. This policy provides consistency of bill
> data with the cost report so that bill data may be used to
> substantiate the cost report. Medicare and non-Medicare charges for
> the same department must be reported consistently on the cost report.
> This means that the professional component is included on, or excluded
> from, the cost report for Medicare and non-Medicare charges. Where
> billing for the professional components is not consistent for all
> payers, i.e., where some payers require net billing and others require
> gross, the provider must adjust either net charges up to gross or
> gross charges down to net for cost report preparation. In such cases,
> it must adjust its provider\
> statistical and reimbursement (PS&R) reports that it derives from the
> bill. Laboratory tests (revenue codes 0300-0319) are billed as net for
> outpatient or nonpatient bills because payment is based on the lower
> of charges for the hospital component or the fee schedule. The A/B MAC
> (A or HHH) determines, in consultation with the provider, whether the
> provider must bill net or gross for each revenue center other than
> laboratory. Where "gross" billing is used, the A/B MAC (A or HHH)
> adjusts interim payment rates to exclude payment for hospital-based
> physician services. The physician component
>
> must be billed to the *Part B MAC* to obtain payment. All revenue

> **FL 67 - Principal Diagnosis Code**
>
> **Required**. The hospital enters the ICD code for the principal
> diagnosis. The code **must** be the full ICD diagnosis code, including
> all five digits where applicable for ICD-9 or all seven digits for
> ICD-10. The reporting of the decimal between the third and fourth
> digit is unnecessary because it is implied.
>
> The principal diagnosis code will include the use of "V" codes where
> ICD-9-CM is applicable. Where the proper code has fewer than five
> digits (ICD-9-CM) or seven digits (ICD-10-CM), the hospital may not
> fill with zeros. The principal diagnosis is the condition established
> after study to be chiefly responsible for this admission. Even though
> another diagnosis may be more severe than the principal diagnosis, the
> hospital enters the principal diagnosis. Entering any other diagnosis
> may result in incorrect assignment of a Diagnosis
>
> Related Group (DRG) and cause the hospital to be incorrectly paid
> under PPS. The hospital reports the full ICD code for the diagnosis
> shown to be chiefly responsible for the outpatient services in FL 67
> of the bill. It reports the diagnosis to its highest degree of
> certainty. For instance, if the patient is seen on an outpatient basis
> for an evaluation of a symptom (e.g., cough) for which a definitive
> diagnosis is not made, the symptom must be reported. If during the
> course of the outpatient evaluation and treatment a definitive
> diagnosis is made (e.g., acute bronchitis), the hospital must report
> the definitive diagnosis. When a patient arrives at the hospital for
> examination or testing without a referring diagnosis and cannot
> provide a complaint, symptom, or diagnosis, the hospital should report
> an ICD code for Persons Without Reported Diagnosis Encountered During
> Examination and Investigation of\
> Individuals and Populations.

> the provider enters special annotations. In addition, the provider
> enters any remarks needed to provide information that is not shown
> elsewhere on the bill but which is necessary for proper payment. For
> Renal Dialysis Facilities, the provider enters the first month of the
> 30-month period during which Medicare benefits are secondary to
