>
> Providers sending professional and supplier claims to Medicare on
> paper must use Form CMS-1500 in a valid version. This form is
> maintained by the National Uniform Claim Committee (NUCC), an industry
> organization in which CMS participates. Any new version of the form
> must be approved by the White House Office of Management and Budget
> (OMB) before it can be used for submitting Medicare claims. When the
> NUCC changes the form, CMS coordinates its review, any changes, and
> approval with the OMB.
>
> The NUCC has recently changed the Form CMS-1500, and the revised form
> received OMB approval on June 10, 2013. The revised form is version
> 02/12, OMB control number 0938-1197.
>
> The revised form will replace the previous version of the form 08/05,
> OMB control number 0938-0999.
>
> Throughout this chapter, the terms, "Form CMS-1500," "Form 1500," and
> "CMS-1500 claim form" may be used to describe this form depending upon
> the context and version. The term, "CMS-1500 claim form" refers to the
> form generically, independent of a given version.
>
> Medicare will conduct a dual-use period during which providers can
> send Medicare claims on either the old or the revised forms. When the
> dual-use period is over, Medicare will accept paper claims on only the
> revised Form 1500, version 02/12.
>
> For the implementation and dual-use dates, contractors shall consult
> the appropriate implementation change requests for the revised Form
> 1500. Providers and other interested parties may obtain the
> implementation dates on the CMS web site @ www.cms.gov.
>
> Reminder: Regardless of the paper claim form version in effect:
> **Providers cannot submit ICD-10-CM codes for claims with dates of
> service prior to implementation of ICD-10.**
>
> Medicare A/B MACS (B), DME MACS, physicians, and suppliers are
> responsible for purchasing their own CMS-1500 claim forms. Forms can
> be obtained from printers or printed in-house as long as they follow
> the specifications developed by the NUCC. Photocopies of the CMS-1500
> claim form are NOT acceptable. Medicare will accept any
>
> type (i.e., single sheet, snap-out, continuous feed, etc.) of the
> CMS-1500 claim form for processing. To purchase forms from the U.S.
> Government Printing Office, call (202) 512-1800.
>
> The following instructions are required for a Medicare claim. They
> apply to both the 08/05 and 02/12 versions of the form except where
> noted. A/B MACs (B) and DME MACs should provide information on
> completing the CMS-1500 claim form to all physicians and suppliers in
> their area at least once a year.
>
> These instructions represent the minimum requirements for using this
> form to submit a Medicare claim. However, depending on a given
> Medicare policy, there may be other data that should also be included
> on the CMS-1500 claim form; if so, these additional requirements are
> addressed in the instructions you received for such policies (e.g.,
> other chapters of this manual).
>
> Providers may use these instructions to complete this form. The
> CMS-1500 claim form has space for physicians and suppliers to provide
> information on other health insurance.
>
> This information can be used by A/B MACs (B) to determine whether the
> Medicare patient has other coverage that must be billed prior to
> Medicare payment, or whether there is another insurer to which
> Medicare can forward billing and payment data following adjudication
> if the provider is a physician or supplier that participates in
> Medicare. (See Pub. 100-05, Medicare Secondary Payer Manual, chapter
> 3, and chapter 28 of this manual).
>
> Providers and suppliers must report 8-digit dates in all date of birth
> fields (items 3, 9b, and 11a), and either 6-digit or 8-digit dates in
> all other date fields (items 11b, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 24a, and 31).
>
> Providers and suppliers have the option of entering either a 6 or
> 8-digit date in items 11b, 14, 16, 18, 19, or 24a. However, if a
> provider of service or supplier chooses to enter 8-digit dates for
> items 11b, 14, 16, 18, 19, or 24a, he or she must enter 8-digit dates
> for [all]{.underline} these fields. For instance, a provider of
> service or supplier will [not]{.underline} be permitted to enter
> 8-digit dates for items 11b, 14, 16, 18, 19 and a 6-digit date for
> item 24a. The same applies to providers of service and suppliers who
> choose to submit 6-digit dates too. Items 12 and 31 are exempt from

> Homeless Shelter (code 04), Indian Health Service (codes 05, 06),
> Tribal 638 (codes 07, 08), and 09 Prison/Correctional Facility
> settings, describe below. Where there is no national policy for a

> designated below. In addition, local contractors, when\
> developing policy, must ensure that they continue to pay appropriate
> rates for services rendered in the new setting; if they choose to
> create a crosswalk from one setting to another, they must crosswalk a
> facility rate designated code to another facility rate designated
> code, and a nonfacility rate designated code to another nonfacility
> rate designated code. For\
> previously issued POS codes for which a crosswalk was mandated, and
> for which no other national Medicare directive has been issued, local
> contractors may elect to continue to use the crosswalk or develop
> local policy regarding the services payable in the setting, including
> another crosswalk, if\
> appropriate. If a local contractor develops local policy for these

> •***Special Considerations for Telehealth Claims (Codes 02, 10)***
>
> *Note that while the modification of POS Code 02 and the creation of
> POS Code 10 are effective in the National POS code set effective
> January 1, 2022,*\
> *Medicare contractors received instructions regarding how to process
> claims with these codes starting April 4, 2022, so that Medicare would
> align with existing Telehealth claims processing policy, as well as be
> considered HIPAA compliant.*
>
> •**Special Considerations for Homeless Shelter (Code 04)**
>
> Note that for the purposes of receiving durable medical equipment
> (DME), a homeless shelter is considered the beneficiary's home.
>
> Because DME is payable in the beneficiary's home, the crosswalk for
> Homeless Shelter (code 04) to Office (code 11) that was\
> mandated effective January 1, 2003, may need to be adjusted or local
> policy developed so that HCPCS codes for DME are covered when other
> conditions are met and the beneficiary is in a homeless shelter. If
> desired, local contractors are permitted to work with their medical
> directors to determine a new crosswalk such as from Homeless Shelter
> (code 04) to Home (code 12) or Custodial Care Facility (code 33) for
> DME provided in a homeless shelter setting. If a local contractor is
> currently paying claims correctly, however, it is not necessary to
> change the current crosswalk.
>
> •**Special Considerations for Indian Health Service (Codes 05, 06)
> and** **Tribal 638 Settings (Codes 07, 08)**
>
> Medicare does not currently use the POS codes designated for these
> settings. Follow the instructions you have received regarding how to
> process claims for services rendered in IHS and Tribal 638 settings.
> If you receive claims with these codes, you must initially accept them
> in terms of HIPAA compliance.
>
> However, follow your "return as unprocessable" procedures after this
> initial
>
> compliance check. Follow your "return as unprocessable\" procedures
> when you receive paper claims with these codes. (Note that while these
> codes became part of the National POS code set effective January 1,
> 2003, Medicare contractors received instructions regarding how to
> process claims with these codes effective October 1, 2003, so that
> Medicare could be HIPAA compliant by October 16, 2003).
>
> •**Special Considerations for Mobile Unit Settings (Code 15)**
>
> When services are furnished in a mobile unit, they are often provided
> to serve an entity for which another POS code exists. For example, a
> mobile unit may be sent to a physician's office or a skilled nursing
> facility. If the mobile unit is serving an entity for which another
> POS code already exists, providers should use the POS code for that
> entity. However, if the mobile unit is not serving an entity which
> could be described by an existing POS code, the providers are to use
> the Mobile Unit POS code 15. Apply the nonfacility rate to payments
> for services designated as being furnished in POS code 15; apply the
> appropriate facility or nonfacility rate for the POS code designated
> when a code other than the mobile unit code is indicated.
>
> A physician or practitioner\'s office, even if mobile, qualifies to
> serve as a telehealth originating site. Assuming such an office also
> fulfills the requirement that it be located in either a rural health
> professional shortage area as defined under section 332(a)(1)(A) of
> the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.
>
> 254e(a)(1)(A)) or in a county that is not included in a Metropolitan
> Statistical Area as defined in section 1886(d)(2)(D) of the Act, the
> originating physician\'s office should use POS code 11 (Office) in
> order to ensure appropriate payment for services on the list of
> Medicare Telehealth Services.
>
> •**Special Considerations for Prison/Correctional Facility Settings
> (Code 09)**
>
> The addition of code 09 to the POS code set and Medicare claims
> processing reflects Medicare's compliance with HIPAA laws and
> regulations. Local contractors must continue to comply with CMS
> current policy that does not allow payment for Medicare services in a
> penal institution in most cases. The addition of a POS code for a
> prison/correctional facility setting does not supersede this policy.
> (See Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing, section 10.4, chapter
> 1.)
>
> •**Special Considerations for Walk-In Retail Health Clinic (Code 17)**
> (Effective no later than May 1, 2010)
>
> It should be noted that, while some entities in the industry may elect
> to use POS code 17 to track the setting of immunizations, Medicare
> continues to require its billing rules for immunizations claims, which
> are found in chapter 18, section 10 of this manual. Contractors are to
> instruct providers and suppliers of
>
> immunizations to continue to follow these Medicare billing rules.
> However, Medicare contractors are to accept and adjudicate claims
> containing POS code 17, even if its presence on a claim is contrary to
> these billing instructions.
>
> •**Special Considerations for Services Furnished to Registered
> Inpatients**
>
> When a physician/practitioner furnishes services to a registered
> inpatient, payment is made under the PFS at the facility rate. To that
> end, a\
> physician/practitioner/supplier furnishing services to a patient who
> is a\
> registered inpatient, shall, at a minimum, report the inpatient
> hospital POS code 21 irrespective of the setting where the patient
> actually receives the face-to-face encounter. In other words,
> reporting the inpatient hospital POS code 21 is a minimum requirement
> for purposes of triggering the facility payment under the PFS when
> services are provided to a registered inpatient. If the\
> physician/practitioner is aware of the exact setting the beneficiary
> is a\
> registered inpatient, the appropriate inpatient POS code may be
> reported consistent with the code list annotated in this section
> (instead of POS 21). For example, a physician/practitioner may use POS
> 31, for a patient in a SNF receiving inpatient skilled nursing care,
> POS 51, for a patient registered in a Psychiatric Inpatient Facility,
> and POS 61 for patients registered in a\
> Comprehensive Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility.
>
> •**Special Considerations for Outpatient Hospital Departments**
>
> The place of service (POS) code for "Outpatient Hospital" has been
> expanded. The description of POS 22 has been revised from "Outpatient
> Hospital" to "On Campus-Outpatient Hospital" and POS 19 has been
> created for the "Off Campus- Outpatient Hospital" setting. Throughout
> this Internet Only Manual (IOM) you may find references to "Outpatient
> Hospital" that do not\
> differentiate between the "On Campus" or "Off Campus" setting;
> however, any reference to POS 22 (formerly "Outpatient Hospital")
> found anywhere within the IOM is now defined as "On Campus-Outpatient
> Hospital." In addition, POS 19 will also apply in the majority of
> situations describing an outpatient hospital setting. When a
> physician/practitioner furnishes services to an outpatient of a
> hospital, payment is made under the PFS at the facility rate.
>
> Physicians/practitioners who furnish services to a hospital
> outpatient, including in a hospital outpatient department (including
> in a provider-based department of that hospital) or under arrangement
> to a hospital shall, at a minimum, report the off campus-outpatient
> hospital POS code 19 or on campus-outpatient hospital POS code 22
> irrespective of the setting where the patient actually receives the
> face-to-face encounter. In other words, reporting the outpatient
> hospital POS code 19 or 22 is a minimum requirement for purposes of\
> triggering the facility payment amount under the PFS when services are
> provided to a registered outpatient. If the physician/practitioner is
> aware of the exact setting where the beneficiary is a registered
> hospital outpatient, the appropriate outpatient facility POS code may
> be reported consistent with the
>
> code list annotated in this section (instead of POS 19 or 22).
>
> For example, physicians/practitioners may use POS code 23 for services
> furnished to a patient registered in the emergency room, POS 24 for
> patients registered in an ambulatory surgical center, and POS 56 for
> patients registered in a psychiatric residential treatment center.
>
> **NOTE: Physicians/practitioners who perform services in a hospital
> outpatient department shall use, at a minimum, POS code 19 (Off
> Campus- Outpatient Hospital) or POS code 22 (On Campus-Outpatient
> Hospital).**
>
> Code 19 or 22 (or other appropriate outpatient department POS code as
> described above) shall be used unless the physician maintains separate
> office space in the hospital or on the hospital campus and that
> physician office space is not considered a provider-based department
> of the hospital as defined in 42. C.F.R.
>
> 413.65. Physicians shall use POS code 11 (office) when services are
> performed in a separately maintained physician office space in the
> hospital or on the hospital campus and that physician office space is
> not considered a provider-based department of the hospital. Use of POS
> code 11(office) in the hospital outpatient department or on hospital
> campus is subject to the physician self-referral provisions set forth
> in 42 C.F.R 411.353 through 411.357.
>
> •**Special Consideration for Ambulatory Surgical Centers (Code 24)**
>
> When a physician/practitioner furnishes services to a patient in a
> Medicare- participating ambulatory surgical center (ASC), the POS code
> 24 (ASC) shall be used.
>
> **NOTE: Physicians/practitioners who perform services in an ASC shall
> use POS code 24 (ASC).** Physicians/practitioners are not to use POS
> code 11 (office) for ASC based services unless the physician has an
> office at the same physical location of the ASC, which meets all other
> requirements for operating as a physician office at the same physical
> location as the ASC -- including meeting the "distinct entity"
> criteria defined in the ASC State Operations Manual that precludes the

> •**Special Considerations for Hospice (Code 34)**
>
> When a physician/practitioner furnishes services to a patient under
> the hospice benefit, use the following guidelines to identify the
> appropriate POS.
>
> When a beneficiary is in an "inpatient" respite or general "inpatient"
> care stay, the POS code 34 (hospice) shall be used. When a beneficiary
> who has elected coverage under the Hospice benefit is receiving
> inpatient hospice care in a hospital, SNF**,** or hospice inpatient
> facility, POS code 34 (Hospice) shall be used to designate the POS on
> the claim.
>
> For services provided to a hospice beneficiary in an outpatient
> setting, such as the physician/nonphysician practitioner's office (POS
> 11); the beneficiary's home (POS 12), i.e., not operated by the
> hospice; or other outpatient setting (e.g., off campus-outpatient
> hospital (POS 19) or on campus-outpatient hospital (POS 22)), the
> patient's physician or nonphysician practitioner or hospice
> independent attending physician or nurse practitioner, shall assign
> the POS code that represents that setting, as appropriate.
>
> There may be use of nursing homes as the hospice patient's "home,"
> where the patient resides in the facility but is receiving a home
> level of care. In addition, hospices are also operating "houses" or
> hospice residential entities where hospice patients receive a home
> level of care. In these cases, physicians and nonphysician
> practitioners, including the patient's independent attending physician
> or nurse practitioner, shall use the appropriate POS code representing
> the particular setting, e.g., POS code 32 for nursing home, POS code
> 13 for an assisted living facility, or POS code 14 for group home.

> for Place of Service (POS) Codes**\
> **(Rev. 3490, Issued: 04-01-16, Effective: 04-25-16, Implementation:
> 04-25-16)**
>
> For purposes of payment under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule
> (MPFS), the POS code is generally used to reflect the actual setting
> where the beneficiary receives the face-to-face service. For example,
> if the physician's face-to-face encounter with a patient occurs in the
> office, the correct POS code on the claim, in general, reflects the
> 2-digit POS code 11 for office. In these instances, the 2-digit POS
> code (Item 24B on the claim Form CMS-1500) will match the address and
> ZIP entered in the service location (Item 32 on the 1500 Form) -- the
> physical/geographical location of the physician. However, there are
> two exceptions to this general rule -- these are for a service
> rendered to a patient who is a registered inpatient or an outpatient
> of a hospital. In these cases, the correct POS code \-- regardless of
> where the face-to-face service occurs \-- is that of the appropriate
> inpatient POS code (at a minimum POS code 21) or that of the
> appropriate outpatient hospital POS code (at a minimum POS code 19 or
> 22, for outpatient services performed off campus or on campus) as
> discussed in section 10.5 of this chapter. So, if in the above
> example, the patient seen in the physician's office is actually an
> inpatient of the hospital, POS code 21, for inpatient hospital, is
> correct. In this example, the POS code reflects a different setting
> than the address and ZIP code of the practice location (the
> physician's office).
>
> For MPFS payment purposes the determinant of payment is the locality
> where the physician or supplier furnished the service. Medicare has
> both facility and non-facility designations for services paid under
> the physician fee schedule. In accordance with Chapter 1, Section
> 10.1.1 (Payment Jurisdiction Among Local Medicare Administrative
> Contractors (MACs) for Services Paid Under the Physician Fee Schedule
> and Anesthesia Services) of this manual, the jurisdiction for
> processing a request for payment for services paid under the MPFS is
> governed by the payment locality where the physician or supplier
> furnished the service and will be based on the ZIP code. CMS requires
> that the address and ZIP code of the physician's practice location be
> placed on the claim form in order to determine the appropriate
> locality \-- item 32 on the paper claim Form CMS 1500 or in the
> corresponding loop on its electronic equivalent.
>
> For specific POS instructions and determination of the applicable
> payment locality for the PC (professional interpretation) and the TC
> of diagnostic tests see chapter 13, section 150 of this manual. For
> general policy on POS code assignment, see chapter 12, section 20.4.2
> of this manual regarding the site of service payment differential
> under MPFS.
>
> If the physician bills for lab services performed in his/her office,
> the POS code for \"Office\" is shown. If the physician bills for a lab
> test furnished by another physician, who maintains a lab in his/her
> office, the code for \"Other\" is shown. If the physician bills for a
> lab service furnished by an independent lab, the code for
> \"Independent Laboratory\" is used. Items 21 and 22 on the Form
> CMS-1500 must be completed for all laboratory work performed outside a
> physician\'s office. If an independent lab bills, the place where the
> sample was taken is shown. An independent laboratory taking a sample
> in its
>
> laboratory shows \"81\" as place of service. If an independent
> laboratory bills for a test on a sample drawn on an inpatient or
> outpatient of a hospital, it uses the code for the inpatient (POS code
> 21), off campus-outpatient hospital (POS code 19), or on
> campus-outpatient hospital (POS code 22), respectively.
>
> For hospital visits by physicians, presume, in the absence of evidence
> to the contrary, that visits billed for were made. However, review a
> sample of physician\'s records when there are questionable patterns of
> utilization. Confirm these visits where the medical facts do not
> support the frequency of the physician\'s visits or in cases of
> beneficiary complaints.
>
> If questioning whether the visit had been made, ascertain whether the
> physician\'s own entry is in the patient\'s record at the provider.
> Accept an entry where the nurses\' notes indicate that the physician
> saw the patient on a given day. A statement by the beneficiary is also
> acceptable documentation if it was made close to the alleged date of
> the visit. Entries in the physician\'s records represent possible
> secondary evidence. However, these are of less value since they are
> self-serving statements. Exercise judgment regarding their
> authenticity. The policy requiring daily physician visits is not
> conclusive if, in the individual case, the facts did not support a
> finding that daily visits were made.
>
> If a claim lacks a valid place of service (POS) code in item 24b, or
> contains an invalid POS in item 24b, return the claim as unprocessable
> to the provider or supplier, using Group Code CO, Claim Adjustment
> Remark Code (CARC) 16, and Remittance Advice Remark Code (RARC) M77.
> Effective for claims received on or after April 1, 2004, only one POS
> may be submitted on the Form CMS-1500 for services paid under the MPFS
> and anesthesia services. If the place of service is missing and the
> MAC cannot infer the place of service from the procedure code billed
> (e.g., a procedure code for which the definition is not site specific
> or which can be performed in more than one setting), then return
> services as unprocessable.
>
> If place of service is inconsistent with procedure code billed, then
> edit for consistency or compatibility between the place of service and
> site-specific procedure codes. If the place of service is valid but
> inconsistent or incompatible with the procedure billed (e.g., the
> place of service is inpatient hospital and the procedure code billed
> is office visit), then return services as unprocessable since the MAC
> typically will not know whether the procedure code or the place of
> service is incorrect in such instances. If place of service is
> invalid, then edit for the validity of the place of service coding. If
> the place of service code is not valid (e.g., the number designation
> has not been assigned or defined by CMS), then return services as
> unprocessable.

> **(Rev. 2814, Issued: 11-15-13, Effective: 01-01-14, Implementation:
> 01-06-14)**
>
> Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) must assign the proper TOS
> using the annual HCPCS update from the CMS mainframe. Changes to this
> list are issued annually via a Recurring Update Notification. Some
> procedures may have more than one\
> applicable TOS. For claims received on or after April 3, 1995, CWF
> produced alerts on
>
> codes with incorrect TOS designations. Effective July 3, 1995, CWF
> began rejecting codes with incorrect TOS designations.
>
> The only exceptions to this annual update are:
>
> •Surgical services billed for dates of service through December 31,
> 2007, containing the ASC facility service modifier SG must be reported
> as TOS F.
>
> Effective for services on or after January 1, 2008, the SG modifier is
> no longer applicable for Medicare services. ASC providers should
> discontinue applying the SG modifier on ASC facility claims. The
> indicator 'F' does not appear in the TOS table because its use depends
> upon claims submitted with POS 24 (ASC Facility) from an ASC
> (specialty 49). This became effective for dates of service January 1,
> 2008 and after.
>
> •Surgical services billed with an assistant-at-surgery modifier
> (80-82, AS) must be reported with TOS 8. The 8 indicator does not
> appear on the TOS table because its use is dependent upon the use of
> the appropriate modifier. (See Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing
> Manual, Chapter 12, \"Physician/Nonphysician Practitioner,\" for
> instructions on when assistant-at-surgery is allowable.)
>
> •TOS H appears in the list of descriptors. However, it does not appear
> in the table. In CWF, \"H\" is used only as an indicator for hospice.
> The contractor should not submit TOS H to CWF at this time.
>
> •For outpatient services, when a transfusion medicine code appears on
> a claim that also contains a blood product, the service is paid under
> reasonable charge at 80%, coinsurance and deductible apply. When
> transfusion medicine codes are paid under the clinical laboratory fee
> schedule pay at 100%, coinsurance and\
> deductible do not apply.
>
> **NOTE:** For injection codes with more than one possible TOS
> designation, use the following guidelines when assigning the TOS:
>
> When the choice is L or 1,
>
> •Use TOS L when the drug is used related to ESRD; or
>
> •Use TOS 1 when the drug is not related to ESRD and is administered in

>
> When the choice is G or 1:
>
> •Use TOS G when the drug is an immunosuppressive drug; or
>
> •Use TOS 1 when the drug is used for other than immunosuppression.
>
> When the choice is P or 1,
>
> •Use TOS P if the drug is administered through durable medical
> equipment (DME); or
>
> •Use TOS 1 if the drug is administered in the office.

>
> **(Rev. 1725, Issued: 05-01-09, Effective: 07-01-09, Implementation:
> 07-06-09)**
>
> Medicare physician/non-physician practitioner specialty codes describe
> the\
> specific/unique types of medicine that physicians and non-physician
> practitioners (and certain other suppliers) practice. Physicians
> self-designate their Medicare physician specialty on their Medicare
> enrollment application (CMS-855I) or on the Internet-based Provider
> Enrollment, Chain and Ownership System. Non-physician practitioners
> are assigned a Medicare specialty code when they enroll based on their
> profession. Specialty codes are used by CMS for programmatic and
> claims processing purposes.
>
> A. A physician specialty association will submit a specialty code
> request to the Director, Division of Practitioner Services, Center for
> Medicare Management, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Mail
> Stop C4-01-26, 7500 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21244.
>
> Medicare contractors shall not add any specialty codes to the list.
> They must send all requests for expansion of the specialty code list
> to the Director, Division of Practitioner Services, at the address
> above.
>
> B. When considering a request for expanding the specialty code list
> for physician and non-physician practitioners, CMS will take into
> consideration the following:
>
> •Whether the requested specialty has the authority to bill Medicare
> independently;
>
> •The requester's stated reason or purpose for the code;
>
> •Evidence that the practice pattern of the specialty is markedly
> different from that of the dominant parent specialty;
>
> •Evidence of any specialized training and/or certification required;

•Whether the specialty treats a significant volume of the Medicare
population;

> •Whether the specialty is recognized by another organization, such as
> the American Board of Medical Specialties; and
>
> •Whether the specialty has a corresponding Healthcare Provider
> Taxonomy Code.
>
> Physicians may not have a specialty code of 70 (single or
> multi-specialty Clinic or Group Practice.) Contractors must contact
> physicians whose records indicate specialty code 70 and require the
> physicians to update their enrollment records by submitting a CMS-8551
> with a specialty that is valid for a physician.
>
> **10.8.1 - Assigning Specialty Codes by A/B MACs (B) and DME MACs**
>
> Physicians are allowed to choose a primary and a secondary specialty
> code. If the A/B MAC (B) and DME MAC provider file can accommodate
> only one specialty code, the A/B MAC (B) or DME MAC assigns the code
> that corresponds to the greater amount of allowed charges. For
> example, if the practice is 50 percent ophthalmology and 50 percent
> otolaryngology, the A/B MAC (B)/DME MAC compares the total allowed
> charges for the previous year for ophthalmology and otolaryngology
> services. They assign the code that corresponds to the greater amount
> of the allowed charges.
