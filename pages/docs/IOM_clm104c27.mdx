> system which uses localized databases maintained by designated
> contractors called 'CWF Hosts'. The CWF System software is duplicated
> and utilized by the nine CWF Hosts localized databases to process
> claims.
>
> Each Medicare beneficiary is assigned to only one Host site based on
> beneficiary geographic location. CWF Hosts maintain total beneficiary
> claim history and entitlement information for the beneficiaries in
> their jurisdiction.
>
> Each jurisdiction is a network of *A/B Medicare Administrative
> Contractors (MACs)* and *Durable Medical Equipment Medicare
> Administrative Contractors (DME MACs),termed "Satellites,"* and
> located in a defined geographic area (sector). Each MAC within the
> sector is linked to its Host via\
> telecommunications through their respective CMS Virtual Data Center
> (VDC).
>
> The Medicare Part A, B or DME processing system creates a nightly CWF
> file out of the MACs processing region, containing claims data. The
> corresponding MAC's VDC transmits these files to the CWF Host. The CWF
> Host uses the CWF software and determines the beneficiary\'s
> eligibility and entitlement status and uses that information to decide
> what action should be taken on the claim. The CWF software also checks
> incoming claims against all other claims types, referred to as A/B
> crossover, previously processed and stored in claims history to
> prevent duplicate payments. The Host returns a response file back to
> the VDC and the file is loaded to the MACs processing region. The file
> will contain various disposition codes, trailers, and error codes,
> used by the\
> processing systems in automatic processing during the batch cycle. The
> responses are applied to the pending claim allowing appropriate system

> This section is intended only to be a brief profile synopsis of CWF

> examined for further details.
>
> The Common Working File system provides a single data source where the
> contractors can verify beneficiary eligibility to receive prepayment
> review and approval of claims.
>
> Each Host site is responsible for processing those claims submitted
> for beneficiaries on its database. These claims are processed through
> a shared software system supplied to each Host by the CWF Maintenance
> Contractor (CWFM). Each change made to the CWF software is released to
> all Host sites in a uniform manner. This software performs consistency
> and utilization editing on claims for corrective action by the MAC's.
>
> The CWF system ensures that:\
> 1. The beneficiary is entitled to either Part A or Part B benefits,
> depending on the type of claim submitted.
>
> 2\. The co-pay and/or deductible applied, if any, is accurate.
>
> 3\. Services are allowed.
>
> 4\. Benefits are available for the services submitted on the claim
>
> The CWF system also ensures that the services on the claim have not
> been paid on another claim - either the same type or another type of
> claim. If any of these conditions occur, the CWF system returns a
> response and identifies the reason for the rejection. The response
> also includes one or more trailers that identify the correct
> information necessary for the Medicare contractor to take the
> necessary action.
>
> Prior to adjudication of claims, the CWF Host will send the claim to
> Fraud Prevention System (FPS) for review. FPS will make a payment
> determination which will be sent to the CWF Host. The CWF Host will
> then process the claims through consistency and utilization to ensure
> beneficiary is entitled to either Part A or Part B benefits, depending
> on the type of claim submitted.
>
> Once the claim passes all of the edits, the CWF beneficiary master
> file is updated to reflect the benefits now available, as well as any
> changes to the deductible status. The claim is added to the CWF full
> claim history file.
>
> CWF also provides eligibility and entitlement check via the
> beneficiary data streamlining (BDS) system which occurs earlier in the
> claims lifecycle to check for Medicare\
> beneficiary identifier, eligibility and entitlement prior to the
> submission of the claim.

>
> The local CWF database for each sector resides at a Host. Each A/B and
> DME MAC within the sector is linked to its Host\'s database.
> Communication between them is electronic, with claims ready for
> payment or denial communicated to the Host, and adjustments,
> approvals, rejects, and informational trailers returned from the Host
> via a daily process. The A/B and DME MAC's usually initiates this
> process. On occasion, the CWF Host will initiate an \"unsolicited
> response\" to the A/B and DME MAC's as a result of a new claims action
> that affects a previously processed claim action.
>
> Claims are processed by CWF in the same order that they are received,
> regardless of the dates of service or receipt date. This
> first-in-first-out method of processing requests for payment
> facilitates prompt handling of claims.

> of the following types:
>
> •**A/B MAC (A) Claim Record:** *A/B MAC (A)* bills are input on the
> HBDA record.
>
> •**A/B MAC (B) Claim Record:** *A/B MAC (B)* bills are input on the

> \"Full Credit\" code (Entry Code 3 for *A/B MACs (B) and DME MACs* and
> Action Code 4 for *A/B MACs (A, HHH))*).
>
> •**Change -** Send a full claim with a \"Replacement Debit\" code
> (Entry Code 5 for *A/B MACs (B) and DME MACs* and Action Code 3 for
> *A/B MACs (A, HHH)*) and the original document control number to make
> a change to a posted claim. This code is used to change most claims
> information. The old claim information will be backed out and replaced

> Insurance File (COIF) to the nine CWF host sites on a weekly basis.
> The COIF will contain specific information that will identify the

> partner, including name, COBA ID, address, and tax identification
> number (TIN). It will also contain each trading partner's claims
> selection criteria exclusions (claim or bill types that the trading
> partner does not want to receive via the crossover process) along with

> wishes its name to be printed on the Medicare Summary Notice (MSN).
>
> The CWF shall load the initial COIF submission from *the BCRC* as well
> as all future weekly updates.
>
> Upon receipt of a claim, the CWF shall take the following actions:
>
> a\. Search for a COBA eligibility record on the BOI auxiliary record
> for each beneficiary, unless there is a COBA ID in range 55000 through
> 55999 present on the incoming HUBC or HUDC claim (which identifies
> Medigap claim-based crossover), and obtain the associated COBA ID(s)

> b\. Refer to the COIF associated with each COBA ID (NOTE: CWF shall
> pull the COBA ID from the BOI auxiliary record) to obtain the COBA
> trading partner's name and claims selection criteria;
>
> c\. Apply the COBA trading partner's selection criteria; and
>
> d\. Transmit a BOI reply trailer 29 to the *A/B MAC or DME MAC*

> to be crossed over.
>
> Effective with October 1, 2007, CWF shall cease returning an edit 5248

> 4\. Additional Information Included on the HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, HUHC,
> HUBC and HUDC Queries to CWF
>
> Beneficiary Liability Indicators on Part B and DMAC CWF Claims
> Transactions
>
> Effective with the January 2005 release, the Part B and DM*E MAC*
> shared systems shall be required to include an indicator 'L'
> (beneficiary is liable for the denied service\[s\]) or 'N'
> (beneficiary is not liable for the denied service\[s\]) in an
> available field on the HUBC and HUDC queries to CWF for claims on
> which all line items are denied. The liability indicators (L or N)
> will be at the header or claim level rather than at the line level.
>
> Currently, the DME MAC shared system is able to identify, through the
> use of an internal indicator, whether a submitted claim is in the
> National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) format. The
> DME MAC shared system shall pass an indicator "P" to CWF in an
> available field on the HUDC query when the claim is in the NCPDP
> format.
>
> The indicator "P" shall be included in a field on the HUDC query that
> is separate from the fields used to indicate whether a beneficiary is
> liable for all services denied on his/her claim.
>
> The CWF shall read the new indicators passed via the HUBC or HUDC
> queries for purposes of excluding denied services on claims with or
> without beneficiary liability and NCPDP claims.
>
> Beneficiary Liability Indicators on Part A CWF Claims Transactions
>
> Effective with October 2007, the CWF maintainer shall create a 1-byte
> beneficiary liability indicator field within the header of its HUIP,
> HUOP, HUHH, and HUHC Part A claims transactions (valid values for the
> field=L or N).
>
> As *A/BMACs (A, HHH)* adjudicate claims and determine that the
> beneficiary has payment liability for any part of the fully denied
> services or service lines, they shall set an 'L' indicator within the
> newly created beneficiary liability field in the header of their HUIP,
> HUOP, HUHH, and HUHC claims that they transmit to CWF. In addition, as
> *A/B MACs (A, HHH)* adjudicate claims and determine that the
> beneficiary has no payment liability for any of the fully denied
> services or service lines---that is, the provider must absorb all
> costs for the fully denied claims---they shall include an 'N'
> beneficiary indicator within the designated field in the header of
> their HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, and HUHC claims that they transmit to CWF.
>
> Upon receipt of an HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, or HUHC claim that contains an
> 'L' or 'N' beneficiary liability indicator, CWF shall read the COBA
> Insurance File (COIF) to determine whether the COBA trading partner
> wishes to receive 'original' fully denied claims with beneficiary
> liability (crossover indicator 'G') or without beneficiary liability
> (crossover indicator 'F') or 'adjustment' fully denied claims with
> beneficiary liability (crossover indicator 'U') or without beneficiary
> liability (crossover indicator 'T').
>
> CWF shall deploy the same logic for excluding Part A fully denied
> 'original' and 'adjustment' claims with or without beneficiary
> liability as it now utilizes to exclude fully denied 'original' and
> 'adjustment' Part B and DME*POS* claims with and without beneficiary
> liability, as specified elsewhere within this section. As of January
> 4, 2010, CWF shall read action code 8, in addition to action code 1,
> in association with incoming fully denied original HUIP and HUOP
> claims. CWF shall continue to read action code 1 for purposes of
> excluding all other fully denied original HUHH and HUHA claims. (See
> items J and K within this section for more specifics regarding revised
> logic for exclusion of fully denied HUIP and HUOP adjustment claims.)
>
> If CWF determines that the COBA trading partner wishes to exclude the
> claim, as per the COIF, it shall suppress the claim from the crossover
> process.
>
> CWF shall post the appropriate crossover disposition indicator in
> association with the adjudicated claim on the HIMR detailed history
> screen (see §80.5 of this chapter).
>
> In addition, the CWF maintainer shall create and display the new
> 1-byte beneficiary liability indicator field within the HIMR detailed
> history screens (INPL, OUTL, HHAL, and HOSL), to illustrate the
> indicator ('L' or 'N') that appeared on the incoming HUIP, HUOP, HUHH,
> or HUHC claim transaction.
>
> CWF Editing for Incorrect Values
>
> If an A/B *MAC (A, HHH)* sends values other than 'L' or 'N' in the
> newly defined *beneficiary* liability field in the header of its HUIP,
> HUOP, HUHH, or HUHC claim, CWF shall reject the claim back to the *A/B
> MAC (A, HHH) or DME MAC* for correction.
>
> Following receipt of the CWF rejection, the *A/BMAC (A, HHH)* shall
> change the incorrect value placed within the newly defined beneficiary
> liability field and retransmit the claim to CWF.
>
> 5\. Modification to the CWF Inclusion or Exclusion Logic for the COBA
> Crossover Process
>
> Beginning with the October 2006 release, the CWF or its maintainer
> shall modify its COBA claims selection logic and processes as
> indicated below. The CWF shall continue to include or exclude all
> other claim types in accordance with the logic and processes that it
> had in place prior to that release.
>
> **D. New A/B MAC (B) Inclusion or Exclusion Logic**
>
> The CWF shall read the first two (2) positions of the Business Segment
> Identifier (BSI), as reported on the HUBC claim, to uniquely include
> or exclude claims from state-specific *A/B MACs (B) or DME MACs*, as
> indicated on the COIF.
>
> **E. Exclusion of Fully Paid Claims**
>
> The CWF shall continue to exclude Part B claims paid at 100 percent by
> checking for the presence of claims entry code '1' and determining
> that each claim's allowed amount equals the reimbursement amount and
> confirming that the claim contains no denied services or service
> lines.
>
> The CWF shall continue to read action code '1' and determine that
> there are no deductible or co-insurance amounts for the purpose of
> excluding Part A original claims paid at 100 percent. In addition, CWF
> shall determine that the Part A claim contained a reimbursement amount
> before excluding a claim with action code '1' that contained no
> deductible and co-insurance amounts and that the claim contained no
> denied services or service lines.
>
> **Claims with Fully Paid Lines, without Deductible or Co-insurance
> Remaining, and Additional Denied Service Lines**
>
> New HUBC Line-Level Indicator Field
>
> Effective January 4, 2010, the CWF maintainer create*d* a new 1-byte
> liability denial indicator (LIAB IND) at the service line level for
> individually denied claim lines in association with the HUBC claim
> transaction (valid values=B or spaces).
>
> Part B Shared System Requirements
>
> When the Part B shared system adjudicates claims where most of the
> claim service detail lines are fully \[or 100 percent\] paid (i.e.,
> contain allowed amounts per line that are the same as the paid amounts
> per line and the lines do not carry deductible or co-insurance
> amounts) but where some detail lines are denied, it shall take the
> following actions: 1)Input a "B" value in the newly created 1-byte
> LIAB IND field for each denied service line where the beneficiary has
> payment liability (NOTE: there may be multiple instances where the "B"
> value will be applied, contingent upon whether the beneficiary is
> liable for each of the denied service lines);
>
> 2)Input spaces in the newly created 1-byte LIAB IND field for each
> denied service line where the provider, rather than the beneficiary,
> is contractually liable for the denied service; and
>
> 3)Transmit the HUBC claim to CWF for normal verification and
> validation processing.
>
> CWF Requirements
>
> The CWF system shall modify its logic for "original" fully paid
> claims, without deductible or co-insurance remaining, in association
> with Part B HUBC claims as follows:
>
> 1)Continue to verify the claim's entry or action code for confirmation
> that the claim is an original;
>
> 2)Confirm that the claim contains service lines where the amount
> allowed per line equals the amount paid per line;
>
> 3)Check for the presence of a "B" line LIAB IND in association with
> any of the denied service lines on the claim;
>
> 4)Suppress the claim from the crossover process if the claim does not
> contain a "B" line LIAB IND for any of the denied service lines; and
>
> 5)Select the claim for crossover if even one of the denied lines
> contains a "B" line LIAB IND.
>
> Upon suppressing the Part B claim from the crossover process, CWF
> shall annotate the claim on the Part B claim detail (PTBH) screen with
> a newly created "AF" (Fully reimbursable claim containing denied lines
> with no beneficiary liability) claims crossover
>
> disposition indicator. (See § 80.5 of this chapter for more details
> regarding crossover disposition indicators.)
>
> **F. Claims Paid at Greater than 100 Percent of the Submitted Charge**
>
> The CWF shall modify its current logic for excluding Part A original
> Medicare claims paid at greater than 100 percent of the submitted
> charges as follows:
>
> In addition to meeting the CWF exclusion criteria for Part A claims
> paid at greater than 100 percent of the submitted charges, CWF shall
> exclude these claims only when there is no deductible or co-insurance
> amounts remaining on the claims.
>
> **NOTE***:* The current CWF logic for excluding Part B original
> Medicare claims paid at greater than 100 percent of the submitted
> charges/allowed amount (specifically, type F ambulatory surgical
> center claims, which typically carry deductible and co-insurance
> amounts) shall remain unchanged.
>
> **G. Claims with Monetary or Non-Monetary Changes**
>
> The CWF shall check the reimbursement amount as well as the deductible
> and co-insurance amounts on each claim to determine whether a monetary
> adjustment change to an original Part A, B, or DM*EPOS* claim
> occurred.
>
> To exclude non-monetary adjustments for Part A, B, and DME*POS*
> claims, the CWF shall check the reimbursement amount as well as the
> deductible and co-insurance amounts on each claim to confirm that
> there were no monetary changes on the adjustment claim as compared to
> the original claim.
>
> Effective with April 1, 2008, the CWF shall also include total
> submitted/billed charges as part of the foregoing elements used to
> exclude adjustment claims, monetary as well as adjustment claims,
> non-monetary. (See sub-section N, "Overarching Adjustment Claim
> Exclusion Logic," for details concerning the processes that CWF shall
> follow when the COBA trading partner's COIF specifies exclusion of
> [all]{.underline} adjustment claims.)
>
> **H. Excluding Adjustment Claims When the Original Claim Was Also
> Excluded**
>
> When the CWF processes an adjustment claim, it shall take the
> following action when the COIF indicates that the "production" COBA
> trading partner wishes to receive adjustment claims, monetary or
> adjustment claims, non-monetary:
>
> •Return a BOI reply trailer 29 to the *A/BMAC or DME MAC* if CWF
> locates the original claim that was marked with an 'A' crossover
> disposition indicator or if the original claim's crossover disposition
> indicator was blank/non-existent;
>
> •Exclude the adjustment claim if CWF locates the original claim and it
> was marked with a crossover disposition indicator other than 'A,'
> meaning that the original claim was excluded from the COBA crossover
> process.
>
> CWF shall not be required to search archived or purged claims history
> to determine whether an original claim had been crossed over.
>
> The CWF maintainer shall create a new 'R' crossover disposition
> indicator, as referenced in a chart within §80.5 of this chapter, to
> address this exclusion for customer service purposes. The CWF
> maintainer shall ensure that adjustment claims that were excluded
> because the original claim was not crossed over shall be marked with
> an 'R' crossover disposition indicator after they have been posted to
> the appropriate HIMR detailed history screen.
>
> **I. Excluding Part A, B, and DME MAC Fully Paid Adjustment Claims
> Without Deductible and Co-Insurance Remaining**
>
> The CWF shall apply logic to exclude Part A and Part B (including
> DM*EPOS*)\
> adjustment claims (identified as action code '3' for Part A claims and
> entry code '5' for Part B and DM*EPOS* claims) when the COIF indicates
> that a COBA trading partner wishes to exclude adjustment claims that
> are fully paid and without deductible or co-insurance amounts
> remaining.
>
> Effective with October 1, 2007, CWF develope*d* logic as follows to
> exclude fully paid Part A adjustment claims without deductible and
> co-insurance remaining:
>
> 1)Verify that the claim contains action code '3';\
> 2)Verify that there are no deductible and co-insurance amounts on the
> claim; 3)Verify that the reimbursement on the claim is greater than
> zero; and 4) Confirm that the claim contains no denied services or

>
> **Special Note:** Effective with October 1, 2007, CWF *ceased*
> by-passing the logic to exclude Part A adjustments claims fully (100
> percent) paid in association with home health prospective payment
> system (HHPPS) types of bills 329 and 339. The CWF shall exclude such

> on the COIF.
>
> The CWF shall develop logic as follows to exclude Part B or DME*POS*

> DM*EPOS*) fully denied adjustment claims that carry additional
> beneficiary liability when the COIF indicates that a COBA trading
> partner wishes to exclude such claims.
>
> Effective with October 1, 2007, the CWF shall apply logic to the Part
> A adjustment claim (action code '3') where the entire claim is denied
> [and]{.underline} the beneficiary has additional liability. As of
> January 4, 2010, that logic shall be changed to also include the
> reading of action code 8, in addition to action code 3, for HUIP and
> HUOP claims. The revised logic will thus be as follows:
>
> 1)Verify that the claim was sent as action code '3';
>
> 2)Verify also if an HUIP or HUOP claim contains action code '8' rather
> than an action code '3'; and
>
> 3)Check for the presence of an 'L' beneficiary liability indicator in
> the header of the fully denied claim. (See the "Beneficiary Liability
> Indicators on Part A CWF Claims Transactions" section above for
> additional information.)
>
> The CWF shall apply logic to exclude Part B and DM*EPOS* adjustment
> claims (entry code '5') where the entire claim is denied and the
> beneficiary has additional liability as follows:
>
> 1)Verify that the claim was sent as entry code '5'; and
>
> 2)Check for the presence of an 'L' liability indicator on the fully
> denied claim.
>
> The CWF maintainer shall create a new 'U' crossover disposition
> indicator for\
> adjustment claims that are 100 percent denied with additional
> beneficiary liability. The CWF maintainer shall ensure that excluded
> adjustment claims that were entirely denied and contained beneficiary
> liability shall be marked with a 'U' crossover disposition indicator
> after they have been posted to the appropriate HIMR detailed history
> screen. In addition, the CWF maintainer shall add "Denied Adjs-Liab"
> to the COBS on HIMR so that this exclusion will be appropriately
> displayed for customer service purposes.
>
> **L. Excluding MSP Cost-Avoided Claims**
>
> The CWF shall develop logic to exclude MSP cost-avoided claims when
> the COIF indicates that a COBA trading partner wishes to exclude such
> claims.
>
> The CWF shall apply the following logic to exclude Part A MSP
> cost-avoided claims:
>
> •Verify that the claim contains one of the following MSP non-pay
> codes: E, F, G, H, J, K, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, 00, 12, 13, 14,
> 15, 16, 17, 18, 25, and 26.
>
> The CWF shall apply the following logic to exclude Part B and DMAC MSP
> cost-avoided claims:
>
> •Verify that the claim contains one of the following MSP non-pay
> codes: E, F, G, H, J, K, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, 00, 12, 13, 14,
> 15, 16, 17, 18, 25, and 26.
>
> The CWF maintainer shall create a new 'V' crossover disposition
> indicator for the exclusion of MSP cost-avoided claims. The CWF
> maintainer shall ensure that excluded MSP cost-avoided claims shall be
> marked with a 'V' crossover disposition indicator after they have been
> posted to the appropriate HIMR detailed history screen. In addition,
> the CWF maintainer shall add "MSP Cost-Avoids" to the COBS on HIMR so
> that this exclusion will be appropriately displayed for customer
> service purposes.
>
> **M. Excluding Sanctioned Provider Claims from the COBA Crossover
> Process**
>
> Effective with April 2, 2007, the CWF maintainer create*d* space
> within the HUBC claim transaction for a newly developed 'S' indicator,
> which designates 'sanctioned provider.'
>
> *A/B MACs (B)* that process claims from physicians (e.g.,
> practitioners and specialists) and suppliers (independent laboratories
> and ambulance companies) shall set an 'S' indicator in the header of a
> fully denied claim if the physician or supplier that is billing is\
> suspended/sanctioned. NOTE: Such physicians or suppliers will have
> been identified by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and will
> have had their Medicare billing privileges suspended. Before setting
> the 'S' indicator in the header of a claim, the *A/B MAC (B)* shall
> first split the claim it is contains service dates during which the
> provider is no longer sanctioned. This will ensure that the *A/BMAC
> (B)* properly sets the 'S' indicator for only those portions of the
> claim during which the provider is sanctioned.
>
> Upon receipt of an HUBC claim that contains an 'S' indicator, the CWF
> shall exclude the claim from the COBA crossover process. The CWF
> therefore shall not return a BOI reply trailer 29 to the *A/BMAC (B)*
> for any HUBC claim that contains an 'S' indicator.
>
> **N. Overarching Adjustment Claim Exclusion Logic**
>
> "Overarching adjustment claim logic" is defined as the logic that CWF
> will employ, independent of a specific review of claim monetary
> changes, when a COBA trading partner's COIF specifies that it wishes
> to exclude all adjustment claims.
>
> *Modified* **CWF Logic**
>
> Effective with April 1, 2008, the CWF maintainer shall change its
> systematic logic to accept a new version of the COIF that now features
> a new "all adjustment claims" exclusion option.
>
> For the COBA eligibility file-based crossover process, where CWF
> utilizes both the BOI auxiliary record and the COIF when determining
> whether it should include or exclude a claim for crossover, CWF shall
> apply the overarching adjustment claim logic as follows:
>
> •Verify that the incoming claim has an action code of 3 or entry code
> of 5 [or]{.underline}, if the claim has an action or entry code of 1
> (original claim), confirm whether it has an "A" claim header value,
> which designates adjustment claim for crossover purposes; and
>
> •Verify that the COIF contains a marked exclusion for "all adjustment
> claims." If these conditions are met, CWF shall exclude the claim for
> crossover under the COBA eligibility file-based crossover process.
>
> If both of these conditions are met, CWF shall exclude the claim for
> crossover under the COBA eligibility file-based crossover process.
> **IMPORTANT:** Independent of the foregoing requirements, CWF shall
> continue to only select an adjustment claim for COBA crossover
> purposes if*:* 1) it locates the matching original claim; and 2) it
> determines that the original claim was selected for crossover (see "H.
> Excluding Adjustment Claims When the Original Claim Was Also Excluded"
> above for more information).
>
> New Crossover Disposition Indicator
>
> Upon excluding the claim, CWF shall mark the claim as it is stored on
> the appropriate HIMR claim detail history screen with a newly
> developed "AC" crossover disposition indicator, which designates that
> CWF excluded the claim because the COBA trading partner wished to
> exclude [all]{.underline} adjustment claims. (See §80.5 of this
> chapter for a description of this crossover disposition indicator.)
>
> The CWF shall display the new indicator within the "eligibility
> file-based crossover" segment of the HIMR detailed claim history
> screen.
>
> **Exception Concerning COBA IDs in the Medigap Claim-based Range**
>
> CWF shall never apply the new overarching adjustment claim exclusion
> logic to\
> incoming HUBC or HUDC claims whose field 34 ("Crossover ID") header
> value falls within the range of 0000055000 to 0000059999, which
> represents the COBA identifier of a COBA Medigap claim-based crossover
> recipient, and for which there is not a\
> corresponding BOI auxiliary record that likewise contains that insurer
> identifier. (See
>
> §80.7 of this chapter for more information concerning the COBA Medigap
> claim-based crossover process.)
>
> **O. Exclusion of Claims Containing Placeholder National Provider
> Identifier (NPI) Values**
>
> Effective October 6, 2008, the CWF maintainer create*d* space within
> the header of its HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, HUHC, HUBC, and HUDC claims
> transactions for a new 1-byte "NPI-Placeholder" field (acceptable
> values=Y or space).
>
> In addition, the CWF maintainer shall create space within page two (2)
> of the HIMR detail of the claim screen for 1) a new category "COBA
> Bypass"; and 2) a 2-byte field for the indicator "BN," which shall
> designate that CWF auto-excluded the claim because it contained a
> placeholder provider value (see §80.5 of this chapter for more details
> regarding the "BN" bypass indicator).
>
> **NOTE:** With the implementation of the October 2008 release, the CWF
> maintainer shall remove all current logic for placeholder provider
> values with the implementation of this new solution for identifying
> claims that contain placeholder provider values.
>
> As MACs adjudicate non VA MRA claims that fall within any of the NPI
> placeholder requirements, their shared system shall take the following
> combined actions:
>
> 1\) Input a "Y" value in the newly created "NPI Placeholder" field on
> the HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, HUHC, HUBC, or HUDC claim transaction if a
> placeholder value exists on or is created anywhere within the SSM
> claim record (**N***OTE*: *Shared* systems shall include spaces within
> the "NPI Placeholder" field when the claim does not contain a
> placeholder NPI value); and
>
> 2\) Transmit the claim to CWF, as per normal requirements.
>
> Upon receipt of claims where the NPI Placeholder field contains the
> value "Y," CWF shall auto-exclude the claim from the national COBA
> crossover process. In addition, CWF shall populate the value "BN" in
> association with the newly developed "COBA Bypass" field on page 2 of
> the HIMR Part B and DME MAC claim detail screens and on page 3 of the
> HIMR A/B MAC (A) claim detail screen.
>
> **P. Excluding Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) Only Codes
> Reported on 837 Professional Claims**
>
> Effective October 6, 2008, the CWF maintainer shall create space
> within the header of its HUBC claim transmission for a 1-byte PQR*S*
> indicator (valid values=Q or space).
>
> In addition, CWF shall create a 2-byte field on page 2 of the HIMR
> claim detail in association with the new category "COBA Bypass" for
> the value "BQ," which shall designate that CWF auto-excluded the claim
> because it contained only PQR*S* codes (see §80.5 of this chapter for
> more details regarding the bypass indicator).
>
> Prior to transmitting the claim to CWF for normal processing, *MCS*
> shall input the value "Q" in the newly defined PQR*S* field in the
> header of the HUBC when all service lines on a claim contain PQRI
> (status M) codes.
>
> Upon receipt of a claim that contains a "Q" in the newly defined
> PQR*S* field (which signifies that the claim contains only PQR*S*
> codes on all service detail lines, CWF shall auto-exclude the claim
> from the national COBA eligibility file-based and Medigap claim-based
> crossover processes. Following exclusion of the claim, CWF shall
> populate the value "BQ" in association with the newly developed "COBA
> Bypass" field on page 2 of the HIMR Part B claim detail screen.
>
> **Q. CWF Requirements for Health Care Pre-Payment Plans (HCPPs) that
> Receive Crossover Claims**
>
> Effective January 5, 2009, at CMS's direction, the *BCRC* assign*ed*
> all HCPP COBA participants a unique 5-byte COBA ID that falls within
> the range 89000 through 89999. The CWF system shall accept the
> reporting of this COBA ID range. (Refer to chapter 28, §70.6 for *MAC*
> requirements in association with HCPP *and HMO cost plan* crossovers.)
>
> **R. Inclusion or Exclusion of Part AClaims By Provider Identification
> Number (ID) as well as Provider State**
>
> Since July 2004, the CWF has read the incoming *BCRC*-created COIF to
> determine each national COBA trading partner's specific claims
> selection as tied to each COBA ID. To accommodate the inclusion or
> exclusion of Part A specific provider identifiers (IDs), CWF currently
> reads the numeric value reported on the COIF by COBA ID and then
> interrogates the "Provider ID" (internal Online Survey, Certification,
> and Reporting \[OSCAR\] identifier) reported on the incoming HUIP,
> HUOP, HUHH, or HUHC claims transaction. For instances where a match is
> found, CWF either includes or excludes the claim from the national
> crossover process, in accordance with the "I" or "E" indicator that
> precedes the provider ID value reported beginning with field 225 of
> the COIF.
>
> Also, since July 2004, CWF has read the 2-digit state code as
> referenced on the COIF as a basis for including or excluding Part A
> claims by provider state. In performing this function, CWF locates the
> incoming "Provider ID" on the HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, or HUHC claims
> transaction and determines if the first 2 bytes match the 2-byte state
> code on the *BCRC*-created COIF. If a match is found, CWF either
> includes or excludes the claim based upon the "I" or "E" value
> reported in field 224 of the COIF.
>
> Effective April 4, 2011, upon its receipt of either a 6-byte Online
> Survey, Certification, and Reporting (OSCAR) provider ID
> [or]{.underline} a 10-digit NPI, as found starting in position 225 of
> the COIF, CWF shall check [both]{.underline} the "Provider ID" and
> "NPI" fields of the incoming HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, or HUHC for potential
> matches. If CWF finds a provider ID or NPI match, it shall either
> include [or]{.underline} exclude the claim based upon the indicator (I
> or E) reported in field 224 of the COIF.
>
> The CWF shall continue to either 1) include the claim if the "I"
> indicator precedes the provider ID or NPI reported on the COIF
> [or]{.underline} 2) exclude the claim and annotate Part A claims
> history with crossover indicator "K" when the reported provider ID or
> NPI on the COIF is identified for exclusion from the crossover
> process. (See §80.5 of this chapter for more information concerning
> the "K" crossover disposition indicator.)
>
> **S. Excluding Fully Denied Claims Adjudicated With An "Other
> Adjustment" (OA") Claim Adjustment Segment Group Code**
>
> Effective October 4, 2010, the CWF maintainer create*d* space within
> the header of its HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, HUHC, HUBC, and HUDC claims
> transactions for a 1-byte Claim Adjustment Segment (CAS) Group Code
> Indicator field (valid values=G or space).
>
> In addition, CWF develop*ed* a new 2-byte "BG" COBA By-pass indicator,
> which designates that CWF auto-excluded the claim because it was
> adjudicated with an "OA" CAS group code for all denied lines or
> services.
>
> Prior to transmitting their adjudicated claims to CWF for normal
> processing, all shared systems shall input the value "G" in the newly
> defined 1-byte CAS Group Code Indicator field in the header of their
> HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, HUHC, HUBC, or HUDC claims when all services or
> claim detail service lines on the affected claims are denied with
> Group Code "OA."
>
> Upon receipt of a claim that contains a "G" in the newly defined CAS
> Group Code Indicator field, CWF shall auto-exclude the claim from the
> national COBA eligibility file-based and Medigap claim-based crossover
> processes. (**NOTE:** CWF shall not be required to read the COIF to
> determine COBA trading partner preferences for claims containing
> either an "L" or "N" beneficiary liability indicator when the incoming
> claim contains a "G" in the newly defined CAS Group Code Indicator
> field.)
>
> Following auto-exclusion of the claim, CWF shall take the following
> actions:
>
> 1\) Annotate the claim with a "BG" COBA bypass indicator; and
>
> 2\) Display the "BG" indicator as part of the COBA Bypass segment on
> page 3 of the appropriate HIMR claim detail screen.
>
> Effective with October 3, 2011, CWF create*d* a consistency edit that
> will activate when the shared systems send HUBC, HUDC, HUIP, HUOP,
> HUHH, and HUHC claims to CWF that contain a value in the CAS Group
> Code Indicator field other than G or spaces.
>
> Upon receipt of this consistency edit, the shared system shall take
> the following actions:
>
> 1)Modify the value reported in the CAS Group Code Indicator either to
> a "G," if appropriate, or spaces; and
>
> 2)Retransmit the claim to CWF.
>
> **T. New Requirements for Other Federal Payers**
>
> Effective with October 3, 2011, the CWF maintainer expand*ed* its
> logic for "Other Insurance," which is COIF element 176, to include
> TRICARE for Life (COBA ID 60000-69999) and CHAMPVA (COBA ID 80214),
> along with State Medicaid Agencies (70000-79999), as entities eligible
> for this exclusion.
>
> Through these changes, if either TRICARE for Life or CHAMPVA wishes to
> invoke the "Other Insurance" exclusion, and if element 176 is marked
> on the COIF for these entities, CWF shall suppress claims from the
> national COBA crossover process if it determines that the beneficiary
> has active additional supplemental coverage.
>
> As part of this revised "Other Insurance" logic for TRICARE and
> CHAMPVA, CWF shall interpret "additional supplemental coverage" as
> including entities whose COBA identifiers fall in any of the following
> ranges:
>
> 00001-29999 (Supplemental);\
> 30000-54999 (Medigap eligibility-based);\
> 80000-80213 (Other Insurer); and\
> 80215-88999 (Other Insurer).
>
> The "Other Insurance" logic for State Medicaid Agencies includes all
> of the following COBA ID ranges:
>
> 00001-29999 (Supplemental);\
> 30000-54999 (Medigap eligibility-based);\
> 60000-69999 (TRICARE);\
> 80000-80213 (Other Insurance)\
> 80214 (CHAMPVA)\
> 80215-88999 (Other Insurer).
>
> **NOTE:** As of October 3, 2011, CWF shall now omit COBA ID range
> 89000-89999 as part of its Other Insurance logic for State Medicaid
> Agencies.
>
> CWF shall mark claims that it excludes due to "Other Insurance" with
> crossover disposition indicator "M" when storing them within the CWF
> claims history screens.
>
> (See §80.5 of this chapter for additional information concerning this
> indicator.)
>
> **U. CWF and Shared Systems Handling of Claims Where Principal
> Diagnosis Is "E" Code or Equivalent Code in Successive ICD Diagnosis
> Versions**
>
> Effective April 1, 2013, CWF create*d* a new 1-byte "First Reported DX
> Code Indicator" field within the header of incoming HUBC and HUDC
> claims transactions. CWF shall only accept "Y" or spaces as valid
> values for the newly created First Reported DX Code Indicator within
> the header of incoming HUBC and HUDC claims and shall develop
> consistency edits to address invalid values submitted in the newly
> created field.
>
> For applicable situations where claims having a principle
> (first-listed) "E" ICD-9 code or, when ICD-10 diagnosis coding is
> implemented, equivalent V00\--Y99 ICD-10 diagnosis code are either not
> rejected due to front-end editing or are returned as unprocessable,
> the Part B and DME MAC shared systems shall:
>
> • Input a "Y" indicator in the First Reported DX Code field (header)
> of the HUBC and HUDC claims; and
>
> • Transmit the affected claims to CWF for normal processing.
>
> The shared systems shall have the ability to react to CWF consistency
> edits received when invalid values are entered in the newly created DX
> Code Indicator field.
>
> Upon receipt of claims that contain a "Y" in First Reported DX Code
> Indicator field, CWF shall by-pass the claims from crossing over. CWF
> shall create a new "BX" COBA by-pass indicator that it will apply to
> claims where a "Y" is present within the DX Code Indicator field (See
> §80.5 of this chapter for more information regarding the new
> indicator). Additionally, CWF shall display the new by-pass indicator

>
> **1. Claims Crossover Disposition Indicators**
>
> Effective with the October 2004 systems release, when a COBA trading

> ID (5-digit COBA ID preceded by 5 zeroes) to identify the entity to
> which the claim was crossed or not crossed, in accordance with the
> terms of the COBA.
>
> Effective with October 2006, the CWF maintainer updated its data\
> elements/documentation to capture the revised descriptor for crossover
> disposition indicators "E," as reflected below. In addition, the CWF
> maintainer shall update its data elements/documentation to capture the
> newly added "R," "S," "T," "U," and "V" crossover disposition
> indicators, as reflected in the Claims Crossover Disposition
> Indicators table below.
>
> Effective with July 2007, the CWF maintainer updated its data
> elements/ documentation to capture the newly added "W," "X," and "Y"
> crossover disposition indicators, as well as all other changes,
> reflected in the table directly below.
>
> As reflected in the table below, the CWF maintainer created crossover
> disposition indicators "Z" and "AA" to be effective October 1, 2007.
> The CWF maintainer created a new "AC" crossover disposition indicator
> as part of its COBA claims selection\
> processing effective April 1, 2008.
>
> Effective January 5, 2009, the CWF maintainer created crossover

>
> The CWF shall, in addition, create and display a new "BT" crossover

> **80.6 - Special Mass Adjustment and Other Adjustment Crossover
> Requirements**\
> **(Rev. 4009, Issued: 03-23-18, Effective: 04-23-18, Implementation:
> 04-23-18)**
>
> **1.Developing a Capability to Exclude Mass Adjustment Claims Tied to
> the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Updates and Mass Adjustment
> Claims-Other**
>
> Effective with July 2, 2007, the CWF maintainer create*d* a new header
> field for a one (1)-byte mass adjustment indicator within its HUBC,
> HUDC, HUOP, HUHH, and HUHC claims transactions. The valid values for
> the newly created field shall be 'M'---mass adjustment claim-Medicare
> Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) and 'O'---mass adjustment claim-other.
> Further, effective with that date, the *BCRC* shall send the CWF host
> sites a modified COIF that contains two new claims exclusion
> categories: mass adjustments-MPFS and mass adjustments-other.
>
> Upon receipt of a claim that contains an 'M' indicator (new field) in
> the header of an HUBC, HUDC, HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, or HUHC claim, CWF
> shall read the COIF to determine whether the COBA trading partner
> wishes to exclude the claim. If CWF
>
> determines that the trading partner wishes to exclude the mass
> adjustment-MPFS claim, it shall exclude the claim from the COBA
> crossover process.
>
> Upon receipt of a claim that contains an 'O' indicator in the header
> of an HUBC, HUDC, HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, or HUHC claim, which designates
> 'mass adjustment claim-other,' the CWF shall read the COIF to
> determine whether the COBA trading partner wishes to exclude the
> claim. If CWF determines that the trading partner wishes to exclude
> mass adjustment claims-other, it shall exclude the claim from the COBA
> crossover process.
>
> **Creation of New Crossover Disposition Indicators**
>
> In relation to its receipt of a claim that has either an 'M' or an 'O'
> header value, the CWF shall create two new crossover disposition
> indicators 'W' ("mass adjustment claim-MPFS) and 'X' ("mass
> adjustments claim-other excluded") on the HIMR detailed history
> screens in association with excluded processed claims for 'production'
> COBA trading partner. The CWF shall display each of the new crossover
> disposition indicators appropriately in association with the processed
> mass adjustment claim-MPFS on the HIMR detailed history screen. (See
> §80.5 of this chapter for further information.) In addition, the CWF\
> maintainer shall develop and display two (2) new exclusion fields
> within the COBA Inquiry Screen (COBS) for 'mass adj.-M' (mass
> adjustments-MPFS) and 'mass adj.-O' (mass adjustments-other).
>
> **2.Developing a Capability to Treat Entry Code '5' and Action Code
> '3' Claims As Recycled 'Original' Claims For Crossover Purposes**
>
> Effective with July 2007, the CWF maintainer shall create a new header
> field within its HUBC, HUDC, HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, and HUHC claims
> transactions for a 1-byte -adjustment indicator (valid
> values='N'\--non adjustment claim for crossover purposes;
> 'A'\--adjustment claim for crossover purposes; or space*s*).
>
> In instances when CWF returns an error code 5600 to a*nA/B MAC or DME
> MAC,* thereby causing it to reset the claim's entry code to '5' to
> action code to '3,' the *A/B MAC or DME MAC* shall set a newly
> developed 'N' non-adjustment claim indicator ('treat as an original
> claim for crossover purposes') in the header of the HUBC, HUDC, HUIP,
> HUOP, HUHH, HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, and HUHC claim in the newly defined
> field before retransmitting the claim to CWF. The A*/B MAC or DME
> MAC's* system shall then resend the claim to CWF.
>
> Upon receipt of a claim that contains entry code '5' or action code
> '3' with a non-adjustment claim header value of 'N,' the CWF shall
> treat the claim as if it were an 'original' claim (i.e., as entry code
> '1' or action code '1') for crossover inclusion or exclusion
> determinations. If CWF subsequently determines that the claim meets
> all other inclusion criteria, it shall mark the claim with an 'A'
> ("claim was selected to be crossed over") crossover disposition
> indicator.
>
> **Additional A/B MAC or DME MAC Requirements Following Receipt of a
> CWF Beneficiary Other Insurance (BOI) Reply Trailer 29 for Such
> Claims**
>
> Upon receipt of a Beneficiary Other Insurance (BOI) reply trailer (29)
> for the recycled claim, the *A/B MAC or DME MACs'* systems shall
> ensure that, as part of their 837 flat file creation processes, they
> populate the 2300 loop CLM05-3 (Claim Frequency Type Code) segment
> with a value of '1' (original). In addition, the *shared* systems
> shall ensure that, as part of their 837 flat file creation process,
> they do not create a corresponding 2330 loop REF\*T4\*Y segment, which
> typically signifies 'adjustment.'
>
> **3. Developing a Capability to Treat Claims with Non-Adjustment Entry
> or Action Codes as Adjustment Claims For Crossover Purposes**
>
> In instances where *A/B MACs and DME MACs* must send adjustment claims
> to CWF as entry code '1' or action code '1' (situations where the
> accrete claim cannot be processed at CWF), they shall set an 'A'
> indicator in a newly defined field within the header of the HUBC,
> HUDC, HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, or HUHC claim.
>
> Upon receipt of a claim that contains entry code '1' or action code
> '1' with a claim adjustment indicator value of 'A,' the CWF shall take
> the following actions:
>
> •Verify that, as per the COIF, the COBA trading partner wishes to
> exclude **either** adjustments, monetary or adjustments, non-monetary,
> **or both**; and
>
> •Suppress the claim from crossover if the COBA trading partner wishes
> to exclude either adjustments, monetary or adjustments, non-monetary,
> or both.
>
> (**NOTE:** The expectation is that such claims do **not** represent
> mass adjustments tied to the MPFS or mass adjustments-other.)
>
> **By Passing of Logic to Exclude Adjustment Claim if Original Claim
> was Not Crossed Over**
>
> For purposes of excluding entry code '1' or action code '1' claims
> that contain an 'A' adjustment indicator value, CWF shall 1) assume
> that the 'original' claim that was purged from its online history was
> crossed over, and 2) bypass its logic for crossover disposition
> indicator 'R' (cross the adjustment claim over only if the original
> claim was previously crossed over). Refer to §80.4 of this chapter for
> further details regarding this logic.
>
> **Actions to Take When A/B MAC or DME MACs Send Invalid Values**
>
> If *A/B MACor DME MACsends* claim adjustment indicator values other
> than 'N,' 'A,' or space within the newly designated header field
> within their HUBC, HUDC, HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, and HUHC claims *to CWF*,
> CWF shall apply an edit to reject the claim back to the *A/B MAC or
> DME MAC*. Upon receipt of the CWF rejection edit, the *shared* systems
> shall correct the invalid value and retransmit the claim to CWF for
> verification and validation.
>
> **Creation of a New Crossover Disposition Indicator For This
> Scenario**
>
> In relation to its receipt of a claim that has an 'A' header value,
> the CWF shall create a new crossover disposition indicator 'Y'
> ("archived adjustment claim-excluded") on the HIMR detailed history
> screens in association with excluded processed claims for 'production'
> COBA trading partners. The CWF shall display the new 'Y' crossover
> disposition indicator in association with the processed mass
> adjustment claim-MPFS on the HIMR detailed history screen. (See §80.5
> of this chapter for further information.)
>
> **Additional A/B MAC or DME MAC Requirements Following Receipt of a
> CWF Beneficiary Other Insurance (BOI) Reply Trailer 29**
>
> If *A/B MACsor DME MACs* receive a BOI reply trailer (29) on a claim
> that had an 'A' indicator set in its header, the *A/B MAC or DME
> MACs'* systems shall ensure that, as part of their 837 flat file
> creation processes, they populate the 2300 loop CLM05-3 ('Claim
> Frequency Type Code') segment with a value that designates
> 'adjustment' rather than 'original' to match the 2330B loop REF\*T4\*Y
> that they create to designate 'adjustment claim.'
>
> If *a given shared* system does not presently create a loop 2330B
> REF\*T4\*Y to designate adjustments, it shall not make a change to do
> so as part of this instruction.
>
> **80.7 - Coordination of Benefits Agreement (COBA) Medigap Claim-Based
> Crossover Process**\
> **(Rev. 4009, Issued: 03-23-18, Effective: 04-23-18, Implementation:
> 04-23-18)**
>
> Effective with claims submitted to Medicare on October 1, 2007, and
> after, participating physicians and suppliers will be expected to
> include a 5 byte COBA identifier (range 55000\-\--55999) on incoming
> crossover claims for purposes of triggering claim-based Medigap
> crossovers. Additionally, effective with October 1, 2007, claim-based
> Medigap crossovers will occur exclusively through the BCRC in the
> Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) American
> National Standards Institute (ANSI) X12-N 837 professional claim
> format (current version) and National Council for Prescription Drug
> Programs (NCPDP) claim format.
>
> **A. Changes to A/B MAC or DME MAC Up-Front Screening Processes for
> COBA Claim-based Medigap Crossovers**
>
> Effective with claims that the A/B MACs (B) and DME MACs will cable to
> CWF on October 1, 2007, their internal processes for screening claims
> for Medigap claim-based crossovers shall be modified to accommodate
> the new Medigap claim-based COBA crossover process. The affected A/B
> MACs (B) and DME MACs' processes for screening claims for Medigap
> claim-based crossovers shall now feature a syntactic editing of the
> incoming COBA claim-based Medigap ID to ensure that the identifier
> begins with a "5" and contains 5 numeric digits. In addition, for
> incoming 837 professional and NCPDP claims, A/B MACs (B) and DME MACs
> shall ensure that the
>
> Medigap claim-based COBA ID is entered within the appropriately
> designated field, loop, or segment of the incoming Medicare claim.
>
> If the claim fails the syntactic verification, the A/B MAC (B) or MAC
> shall not copy the identifier from the incoming claim and populate it
> within field 34 ("Crossover ID") of the HUBC or HUDC claim transaction
> that is sent to the CWF for verification and validation.
>
> Instead, the A/B MAC (B) or DME MACs shall continue to follow its
> pre-existing processes for notifying the provider via the ERA or other
> remittance advice and the beneficiary via the MSN that the information
> reported did not result in the claim being crossed over. The affected
> A/B MACs (B) or DME MACs' screening processes for Medigap claim-based
> crossovers shall also continue to include verification that the
> provider participates with Medicare and that the beneficiary has
> assigned benefits to the provider.
>
> If the provider-populated value for the Medigap claim-based ID passes
> the A/B MAC (B) or DME MAC's syntactic editing process, the affected
> A/B MAC or DME MACs' systems shall copy the Medigap claim-based COBA
> ID value from the incoming claim to field 34 of the HUBC or HUDC
> claims transactions that are sent to CWF for verification and
> validation. The A/B MACs (B) and DME MACs shall populate the
> identifier in field 34 right-justified and prefixed with five zeroes.
>
> **B. CWF Validation of Values within Field 34 of the HUBC and HUDC
> Transactions**
>
> Upon receipt of HUBC and HUDC claims that contain a value within field
> 34\
> ("Crossover ID"), the CWF shall read the value that is present within
> the field for purposes of conducting a validity check. The CWF shall
> accept the following values as valid within field 34: a value within
> the range of 0000055000 to 0000059999, or spaces.
>
> If the A/B MAC (B) or DME MAC has sent an inappropriate value in field
> 34 of the HUBC and HUDC claims transaction, CWF shall return an alert
> code 7704 on the "01" disposition response via the claim-based alert
> trailer 21. For customer service purposes, the CWF maintainer shall
> create a new crossover disposition indicator "Z" to\
> accommodate the scenario of the A/B MAC (B) or DME MAC sending an
> incorrect value within field 34 of the HUBC and HUDC transaction. (See
> §80.5 of this chapter for more information regarding this crossover
> disposition indicator.) At the point that CWF returns an alert code
> 7704 to the affected A/B MAC (B) or DME MAC, it shall take the
> following actions with respect to the claim:
>
> 1\. Mark the claim with crossover disposition indicator "Z" ("invalid
> Medigap claim-based crossover ID included on the claim"); and\
> 2. Display the indicator, together with the invalid COBA ID value from
> field 34, in association with the claim on the appropriate HIMR
> detailed history screen in the "claim-based crossover" segment.
>
> See Pub.100-04 chapter 28, §70.6.4 for an explanation of A/B MAC or
> DME MAC processes following receipt of a CWF alert code 7704 via a 21
> trailer.
>
> **C. CWF Processing for COBA Claim-based Medigap Crossovers**
>
> Following receipt of an HUBC and HUDC claims transaction that contains
> a valid value within field 34 (a value within the range of 0000055000
> to 0000059999 or spaces), CWF shall check for the presence of a BOI
> auxiliary record for the purpose of triggering eligibility file-based
> crossovers. CWF shall then read the COIF to determine the claims
> selection criteria for any eligibility file-based trading partners
> (all other COBA IDs) as well as for the Medigap claim-based insurer
> (range 0000055000 to 0000059999). If the HUBC or HUDC claim contains a
> valid COBA Medigap claim-based ID within field 34 but the valid ID
> cannot be found on the COIF, the CWF shall post the valid COBA Medigap
> claim-based ID without an accompanying crossover disposition indicator
> in association with the claim within the "claim-based crossover"
> segment of the appropriate HIMR claim detailed history screen.
>
> If the claim meets the COBA trading partner's selection criteria, as
> per the COIF, and none of the other scenarios presented below applies,
> CWF shall return a Beneficiary Other Insurance (BOI) reply trailer
> (29) to the A/B MAC (Part B) or DME MAC for purposes of having the A/B
> MAC (B) or DME MAC trigger a crossover to the BCRC.
>
> Duplicate Check
>
> The CWF shall perform a duplicate check to determine if the
> beneficiary is identified for crossover to a Medigap eligibility
> file-based insurer (COBA ID 30000-54999) and to a Medigap claim-based
> insurer (COBA ID 0000055000-0000059999). If CWF determines that the
> beneficiary is identified for crossover to both a "production" Medigap
> eligibility file-based insurer (COBA ID range=30000 to 54999) and a
> Medigap claim-based Medigap insurer (COBA ID range=0000055000 to
> 0000059999), it shall suppress the BOI reply trailer (29) for the
> claim-based Medigap insurer (COBA ID range=\
> 0000055000 to 0000059999).
>
> Crossover Disposition Indicator "AA"
>
> Effective with October 1, 2007, the CWF maintainer created a new
> crossover disposition indicator "AA" to accommodate the CWF duplicate
> check, where it has determined that the beneficiary's claim is
> eligible for crossover to both a "production" Medigap eligibility
> file-based insurer [and]{.underline} a Medigap claim-based crossover
> insurer. After CWF has\
> determined that beneficiary has already been identified for Medigap
> eligibility file-based crossover, it shall take the following actions
> with respect to the claim:
>
> 1\. Mark the associated claim with indicator "AA" ("beneficiary
> identified on Medigap insurer eligibility file; duplicate Medigap
> claim-based crossover voided); and
>
> 2\. Display this indicator, together with the affected claim-based
> Medigap COBA ID, in association with the claim on the appropriate HIMR
> detailed history screen in the "claim-based crossover" segment.
>
> **D. BOI Reply Trailer (29) Process**
>
> If CWF determines that the claim meets the trading partner's claims
> selection criteria, it shall select the claim and return a BOI reply
> trailer 29 for the claim to the affected A/B MAC (B) or DME MAC. The
> CWF shall display the appropriate crossover disposition indicator for
> the claim-based crossover claim within the "claim-based crossover"
> segment of the HIMR claim detailed history screens. As with the COBA
> eligibility file-based crossover process (see §80.4 of this chapter
> for more details regarding this process), CWF shall display the COBA
> ID and accompanying crossover disposition indicator on claim detailed
> history screens, with the exception of circumstances where the valid
> ID cannot be located on the COIF, as discussed above, or the Medigap
> claim-based insurer is in "test" mode with the BCRC. In these
> situations, only the COBA Medigap claim-based ID shall be displayed.
>
> **Modification of the CWF Sort Routine For Multiple COBA IDs and
> Accompanying A/B MAC or DME MAC Actions Following Receipt of the BOI
> Reply Trailer (29)**
>
> In light of the new COBA Medigap claim-based crossover process, the
> CWF sort routine for COBA IDs to be returned via the BOI reply 29
> trailer shall be modified as follows: Medigap eligibility file-based
> (30000-54999), Medigap claim-based (55000-59999), supplemental
> (00001-29999), TRICARE for Life (60000-69999), Other insurer
> (80000-89999), and Medicaid (70000-79999). (NOTE: This information is
> also being updated in §80.4 of this chapter)
>
> Upon receipt of the BOI reply trailer (29), the affected A/B MAC (B)
> or DME MAC shall continue to utilize information from this source to
> populate the beneficiary's MSN and provider ERA or other remittance
> advice in production in accordance with the existing guidance that
> appears in §80.4 of this chapter.
>
> **80.8 - Inclusion and Exclusion of Specified Categories of Adjustment
> Claims for Coordination of Benefits Agreement (COBA) Crossover
> Purposes**
>
> **(Rev. 4009, Issued: 03-23-18, Effective: 04-23-18, Implementation:
> 04-23-18)**
>
> **1.** **CWF Inclusion of Adjustment Claims**
>
> Effective January 5, 2009, the CWF system shall 1) create the newly
> defined **inclusion** of adjustment claims option, along with 1-byte
> file displacement, within its version of the COIF; and 2) accept and
> process this new field when the BCRC transmits it as part of its
> regular COIF updates.
>
> Upon receipt of a COIF that features a COBA identification number (ID)
> with\
> specifications to **include** adjustment claims only, the CWF shall
> select only those claims for COBA crossover that meet the following
> specifications:
>
> 1)The claim's action code=3, entry code=5, or claim adjustment
> indicator="A"--- all of which designate an "adjustment" claim; **and**
>
> 2)The claim meets no other exclusion criteria, as specified on the
> COIF, **[or]{.underline}** does **not** meet the NPI placeholder value
> by-pass exclusion logic.
>
> With the implementation of this change, the CWF shall continue to
> select adjustment claims only if it previously selected the "original"
> claim for crossover (logic for adjustment indicator "R"; see §80.4 of
> this chapter for additional details regarding this logic).
>
> If the incoming HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, HUHC, HUBC, or HUDC claim contains
> spaces in the new designated RAC adjustment indicator field, CWF shall
> select the claim in accordance with the COBA trading partner's claims
> selection criteria specified on the COIF.
>
> **2. CWF Inclusion of Two Categories of Mass Adjustment Claims for
> Crossover Purposes**
>
> Effective January 5, 2009, the CWF system shall 1) create the newly
> defined **inclusion** of mass adjustment claims---MPFS updates and
> mass adjustment claims---other options, along with accompanying 1-byte
> file displacement indicators, within its version of the COIF;and 2)
> accept and process these new fields when the BCRC transmits them as
> part of its regular COIF updates.
>
> Upon receipt of a HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, HUHC, HUBC, or HUDC claim
> transaction, CWF shall take the following actions: 1) Verify that the
> claim transaction contains an "M" or "O" mass adjustment claim header
> indicator; 2) verify that the claim's action code=3, or entry code=5,
> or adjustment header indicator=A; 3) check the COIF to determine if
> the COBA trading partner wishes to include mass adjustment
> claims---MPFS or mass\
> adjustment claims\--other; 4) **include** the claim for crossover,
> unless the "original" claim was **not** crossed over (logic for
> crossover disposition indicator "R") **or** the claim meets any claims
> exclusion criteria as specified on the COIF.
>
> If the incoming HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, HUHC, HUBC, or HUDC claim contains
> spaces in the mass adjustment indicator field, CWF shall select the
> claim per the COBA trading partner's claims selection criteria, as
> specified on the COIF.
>
> **3. CWF Inclusion and Exclusion of Recovery Audit A/B MAC or DME MAC
> (RAC)-Initiated Adjustment Claims**

> At CMS's direction, the BCRC has modified the COIF to allow for the

> The CWF system shall 1) create the newly defined **inclusion** and
> **exclusion** of RAC-initiated adjustment options, along with

> 2) accept and process these new fields when the BCRC transmits them as

> Effective January 5, 2009, the CWF maintainer created a 1-byte RAC
> adjustment value in the header of its HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, HUHC, HUBC,
> and HUDC claims transactions (valid values= "R" or spaces.)
>
> The CWF maintainer shall, in addition, include the 1-byte RAC

>
> **Shared System Actions**
>
> All shared systems shall develop a method for uniquely identifying all
> varieties of RAC-requested adjustments, which occur as the result of
> post-payment review activities.
>
> Prior to sending its processed 11X and 12X type of bill RAC adjustment
> transactions to CWF for normal verification and validation, the Part A
> shared system shall input an "R" indicator in the newly defined header
> field of its HUIP claims transactions if the RAC-initiated adjustment
> claim meets either of the following conditions:
>
> 1\) The claim recovery action resulted in Medicare changing its
> payment decision from paid to denied (i.e., Medicare paid \$0.00 as
> the result of the adjustment performed); **or**
>
> 2\) The claim recovery action resulted in a Medicare adjusted payment
> amount that is **equal to or greater than** the amount of the
> inpatient hospital deductible.
>
> Prior to sending RAC-initiated adjustment claims **with all other type
> of bill**\
> **designations** (bill types other than 11X and 12X) to CWF for normal
> processing, the Part A shared system shall input an "R" indicator in
> the newly defined header field of the HUOP, HUHH, and HUHC claim
> transaction.
>
> Prior to sending their processed RAC adjustment transactions to CWF
> for normal verification and validation, the Part B and DME MAC shared
> systems shall input an "R" indicator in the newly defined header field
> of their HUBC and HUDC claim transactions.
>
> (See chapter 28, §70.6 for more details.)
>
> **CWF Actions**
>
> Upon receipt of a claim that contains an "R" in its header in the
> newly defined field, CWF shall take the additional following actions:
>
> 1\) Verify that the claim's action code=3, entry code=5, or header
> claim adjustment indicator=A;
>
> 2\) Check the COIF to determine if the COBA trading partner wishes to
> **include** RAC-initiated claims;
>
> 3\) **Include** the claim for crossover, **unless** the "original"
> claim was **not** crossed over (logic for crossover disposition
> indicator "R") **or** the claim meets any other claims exclusions
> specified on the COIF; **or**

4\) **Exclude** the claim if the COIF specifies exclusion of
RAC-initiated adjustment claims**.**

> In addition, if the incoming HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, HUHC, HUBC, or HUDC
> claim contains spaces in the new designated RAC adjustment indicator
> field, CWF shall select the claim in accordance with the COBA trading
> partner's claims selection criteria, as specified on the COIF.
