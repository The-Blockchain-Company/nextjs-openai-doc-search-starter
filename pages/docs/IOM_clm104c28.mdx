**10 - Medigap - Definition and Scope**\
**(Rev. 2906, Issued: 03-14-14, Effective: 04-14-14, Implementation
04-14-14)**

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 1990, Public Law
101-508) requires all Medicare supplemental (Medigap) insurance policies
to conform to minimum standards including loss ratio requirements,
standardized benefit packages and consumer protection requirements.

The procedures described in §§20 through 110 apply to all policies
meeting the definition of Medicare supplemental insurance policies
("Medigap") in of the Social Security Act (the Act.).

A Medigap policy is defined as: A group or individual policy of accident
and sickness insurance, or a subscriber contract of hospital and medical
service associations or health maintenance organizations, other than a
policy issued pursuant to a contract under or of the Act, or a policy
issued under a demonstration project.

A Medigap policy is offered by a private company to those entitled to
Medicare benefits and provides payment for Medicare charges not payable
because of the applicability of deductibles, coinsurance amounts or
other Medicare imposed limitations. Typically, a Medigap policy does not
include limited benefit coverage areas available to Medicare
beneficiaries, such as "specified disease" or "hospital indemnity"
coverage. By law, the definition explicitly excludes a policy or plan
offered by an employer to employees, or former employees, as well as
policies offered by a labor organization to members or former members.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has developed model
regulatory language for State insurance commissions to apply to Medigap
insurance offerings. This model regulatory language is located at: It
recommends the requirements that states should consider for approving
proposed Medigap insurance plans.

The following procedures for furnishing information are mandatory for
Medigap plans. Medicaid agencies are furnished information in the
standard format free of charge. Other commercial payers, including
Medigap insurers, must pay a CMS established per claim crossover fee for
providing them with Medicare paid claims data.

**20 - Assignment of Claims and Transfer Policy**\
**(Rev. 4069, Issued: 06-08 -- 18, Effective: 07- 09- 18,
Implementation: 07- 09-18)**

A Medicare beneficiary who has a Medigap policy may authorize the
participating physician/practitioner or supplier of services to file a
claim on his or her behalf and to receive payment directly from the
insurer instead of through the beneficiary. In such cases, Medicare must
transfer Medicare claims information to the Medigap insurer. The Medigap
insurer pays the physician/provider/supplier directly. The Medigap
insurer, in turn, reimburses CMS's designated COBA contractor for the
costs in supplying the information subject to limitations.

Paid claims from participating physicians or providers/suppliers for
beneficiaries who have assigned their right to payment under a Medigap
policy, regardless of whether or not it is in or from a State with an
approved Medigap program, are to result in the transfer of claim
information to the specified insurers.

The A/B MAC (*Part* B) and DME MAC systems must have the capability to
distinguish between claims of participating and nonparticipating
physicians/practitioners and suppliers. This is because Medigap
assignment of claims and transfer policy does not apply to
nonparticipating physicians/practitioners or non-participating
suppliers.

Effective with the future implementation of CMS's consolidated Medigap
claim-based crossover initiative, the process for reporting Medigap
information on incoming claims will change. Each Part B\
physician/practitioner and supplier of durable medical equipment,
prosthetics, orthotics, and medical supplies (DMEPOS) will only include
the CMS-issued Medigap claim-based COBA ID (ID range 55000 through
55999), which will be assigned by CMS's *Benefits Coordination &
Recovery Center (BCRC)*, if: (1) the physician/practitioner or supplier
participates in the Medicare Program; and (2) the beneficiary has
assigned his/her rights to payment under a Medigap policy to that
provider or supplier.

**20.1 - Beneficiary Insurance Assignment Selection**\
**(Rev. 4281, Issued: 04- 19-19, Effective: 05-20-19, Implementation:
05-20-19)**

The term Medicare beneficiary identifier (Mbi) is a general term
describing a beneficiary\'s Medicare identification number. For purposes
of this manual, Medicare beneficiary identifier references both the
Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) and the Medicare Beneficiary
Identifier (MBI) during the new Medicare card transition period and
after for certain business areas that will continue to use the HICN as
part of their processes.

Beneficiaries indicate that they have assigned their Medigap benefits to
a participating physician/practitioner or supplier by signing block #13
on the Form CMS-1500. This authorization is in addition to their
assignment of Medicare benefits as indicated by their signature in block
#12.

Form CMS-1450 makes no provision for the provider to indicate that the
beneficiary has assigned benefits because the Form CMS-1450 is used only
for institutional claims, for which payment is typically assigned to the
provider of services. For claims the institutional provider submits to
A/B MACs (B) for physician payments for physician employees; hospitals,
SNFs, HHAs, OPTs, CORFs, or ESRD facilities may maintain a beneficiary
statement in file instead of submitting a separate statement with each
claim. This authorization must be insurer specific.

If the beneficiary has a Medigap policy, the following statement should
be signed:

> Beneficiary's Medicare beneficiary identifier\
> NAME OF BENEFICIARY MEDIGAP POLICY NUMBER

I request that payment of authorized Medigap benefits be made either to
me or on my behalf to\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for any services furnished me by that
physician/provider/supplier. I authorize any holder of medical
information about me to release to (name of Medigap insurer) any
information needed to determine these benefits or the benefits payable
for related services.

Since the beneficiary may selectively authorize Medigap assignments,
caution providers about routinely stamping *item* #13 of the Form
CMS-1500 "signature on file." The Medigap assignment on file in the
participating doctor/supplier's office must be insurer specific.
However, it may state that the authorization applies to all occasions of
services until it is revoked.

Effective with October 1, 2007, participating Part B
physicians/practitioners and DMEPOS suppliers *now* will only include
the CMS-assigned Medigap claim-based COBA ID on an incoming claim if
confirmation that a beneficiary has authorized Medigap assignment has
been obtained.

**30 - Completion of the Claim Form**\
**(Rev. 2906, Issued: 03-14-14, Effective: 04-14-14, Implementation
04-14-14)**

As part of the national Coordination of Benefits Agreement (COBA)
claim-based Medigap crossover process, participating
physicians/practitioners and suppliers that are attempting to trigger
mandatory

Medigap ("claim-based") crossovers must include the CMS-assigned 5-digit
Medigap COBA claim-based ID (within range 55000 through 55999) within
designated areas on the appropriate claim as follows:

> •Within field NM109 of the NM1 segment within the 2330B loop of the
> incoming Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
> Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12- 837 professional claim
> (current format). \[See §70.6.4 of this chapter for further
> information.\]
>
> •Item 9-D of the incoming paper Form CMS-1500 claim (**NOTE:** the
> PAYERID or the Medigap company or plan name within this field will
> **not** trigger a Medigap claim-based crossover); and

In addition, unless otherwise specified, retail chain pharmacies that
are attempting to trigger crossovers to their clients' Medigap insurers
should enter the Medigap COBA claim-based within field 301-C1 of the T04
segment on the incoming National Council for Prescription Drug Programs
(NCPDP) batch claims. For more information regarding the COBA Medigap
claim-based crossover process, refer to §70.6.4 of this chapter.

**30.1 - ASC X12 837 Professional/Form CMS-1500 COB**\
**(Rev. 2906, Issued: 03-14-14, Effective: 04-14-14, Implementation
04-14-14)**

Participating physicians/practitioners and suppliers sign an agreement
with Medicare to accept assignment of Medicare benefits for all Medicare
patients. A claim for which a beneficiary elects to assign his/her
benefits under a Medigap policy to a participating
physician/practitioner and supplier is called a "mandated Medigap
transfer."

Participating providers and suppliers that must bill electronically
shall enter the 5-digit claim-based Medigap COBA ID in field NM109 of
the NM1 segment in loop 2330B of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) ASC X12 837 professional claim for purposes
of triggering Medigap claim-based crossovers. If a participating Part B
physician/practitioner or DMEPOS supplier fails to include this
identifier in the field just described, the claim will not be
transferred, as appropriate, to the Medigap insurer via the COBA
claim-based Medigap crossover process.

Under CMS's national COBA claim-based Medigap process, participating
Part B physicians/practitioners and suppliers that are exempted under
the Administrative Simplification Compliance Act (ASCA) from having to
bill electronically are required to enter the CMS-assigned 5-digit
claim-based Medigap COBA ID on the paper form.

Medigap information is entered on the CMS Form 1500 as follows:

**Version 08/05**

**Item 9a** - The policy and/or group number of the Medigap insured
preceded by MEDIGAP, MG, or MGAP. Note - item 9d must be completed if a
policy and/or group number is entered in item 9a.

**Item 9b** - The Medigap insured's 8-digit date of birth (MM\|DD\|CCYY)
and sex.

**Item 9c** - Blank if item 9(d) is completed. Otherwise, the claims
processing address of the Medigap insurer. An abbreviated street
address, two-letter postal code, and ZIP Code copied from the Medigap
insured's Medigap identification card is entered. For example:

1257 Anywhere Street\
Baltimore, Md. 21204\
Is shown as\
1257 Anywhere St. MD 21204

**Item 9d** - Enter the Coordination of Benefits Agreement (COBA)
Medigap claim-based Identifier (ID). Refer to chapter 28, section
70.6.4, of this manual for more information."

All the information in items 9, 9a, 9 b, and 9d must be complete and
accurate. Otherwise, the A/B MAC (B) or DME MAC cannot forward the claim
information.

**Version 02/12**

**Item 9a** - Enter the policy and/or group number of the Medigap
insured preceded by MEDIGAP, MG, or MGAP.

Note - item 9d must be completed if a policy and/or group number is
entered in item 9a.

**Item 9b** - Leave blank.

**Item 9c** - Leave blank if item 9d is completed. Otherwise, enter the
claims processing address of the Medigap insurer. Use an abbreviated
street address, two-letter postal code, and ZIP Code copied from the
Medigap insured's Medigap identification card. For example:

1257 Anywhere Street\
Baltimore, Md. 21204\
Is shown as\
1257 Anywhere St. MD 21204

**Item 9d** - Enter the Coordination of Benefits (COBA) Medigap
claim-based identifier (ID). See Chapter 28, §70.6.4 for more
information.

All the information in items 9, 9a, and 9d must be complete and
accurate. Otherwise, the A/B MAC (B) or DME MAC cannot forward the claim
information.

Retail pharmacies that wish to trigger claim-based crossovers to Medigap
insurers shall enter the Medigap claim-based COBA ID within field 301-C1
of the T04 segment of the NCPDP claim.

**30.2 - ASC X12 837 Institutional/Form CMS-1450 COB**\
**(Rev. 2906, Issued: 03-14-14, Effective: 04-14-14, Implementation

In accordance with the language provided within §1842(h)(3)(B) of the
Social Security Act, no information entered on an incoming Form CMS-1450
or incoming Health Insurance Portability Act (HIPAA) ASC X12 837
institutional claim (current format) shall result in a process whereby
CMS transfers the claim to a Medigap insurer.

such cases, the following message is included on the remittance advices.

MA19 - "Information was not sent to the Medigap insurer due to
incorrect/invalid information you submitted concerning the insurer.
Please verify your information and submit your secondary claim directly
to that insurer."

Beginning with the October 2004 systems release, all A/B MACs and DME
MACs shall include COBA trading partner names on the provider Electronic
Remittance Advice (ERA) following receipt of a Beneficiary Other
Insurance (BOI) reply trailer 29. (See §70.6 of this Chapter for more

**[Cost Calculation Process Leading Up to the BCRC's Assumption of
Claim-Based Medigap Crossovers]{.underline}**

Up to and including the final claims transferred under their
pre-existing mandatory Medigap (claim-based) crossover processes (note:
the "final" claims should be those processed by the A/B MAC (*Part* B)
or DME MAC just before the October 2007 release is installed), A/B MACs
(*Part* B) and DME MACs should determine the frequency at which they
routinely transmit notices to all Medigap insurers but must transmit not
less often than monthly. (See [§70.4]{.underline})

Effective October 1, 2005, CMS fully consolidated the eligibility
file-based claims crossover process, as it relates to Medigap insurers
and other commercial payers, under the BCRC. Refer to §70.6 and
succeeding sub-sections for A/B MAC (*Part* B) and DME MAC requirements
and responsibilities relating to the national Coordination of Benefits
Agreement (COBA) consolidated crossover process. Refer to §70.6.4 for
all MAC requirements relating to the COBA Medigap claim-based crossover
process, which was inaugurated on October 1, 2007. (See also Pub.100-04
chapter 27 §80.*7*.)

Following crossover consolidation, all A/B MACs (*Part* B) and DME MACs
shall continue to pursue collection of unpaid debts from Medigap
insurers and other existing trading partners, even after such entities
have been transitioned to the COBA process. Those MACs that maintained
claim-based crossover arrangements with Medigap insurers shall pursue
collection of their invoices up through and including their invoices for
the final claims transfer to the Medigap entities. These invoices should
have been issued no later than one (1) month following the last claims
transfer to the Medigap insurers.

**[Suppression of Sanctioned Provider Claims from Claim-Based Medigap
Crossovers]{.underline}**

Effective with April 2, 2007, all A/B MACs (*Part* B) and DME MACs shall
suppress fully denied provider sanctioned claims for their mandatory
Medigap crossover process with Medigap insurers, as authorized by
§1842(h)(3)(B) of the Social Security Act and §4081(a)(B) of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 \[Public Law 100-230\].

**NOTE:** All A/B MACs (*Part* B) and DME MACs shall continue to

The term Medicare beneficiary identifier (Mbi) is a general term
describing a beneficiary\'s Medicare identification number. For purposes
of this manual, Medicare beneficiary identifier references both the
Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) and the Medicare Beneficiary
Identifier (MBI) during the new Medicare card transition period and
after for certain business areas that will continue to use the HICN as
part of their processes.

**Background -- Medicare Claims Crossover Process---General**

Through the Benefits Coordination & Recovery Center (BCRC), Medicare
transmits outbound 837 Coordination of Benefit (COB) and Medigap claims
to COB trading partners and Medigap plans,\
collectively termed "trading partners," on a post-adjudicative basis.
This type of transaction, originating at individual A/B MACs and DME
MACs following their claims adjudication activities, includes incoming
claim data, as modified during adjudication if applicable, as well as
payment data. All A/B MACs and DME MACs are required to accept all ASC
X12 837 segments and data elements permitted by the in-force applicable
guides on an initial ASC X12 837 professional or institutional claim
from a provider, but they are not required to use every segment or data
element for Medicare adjudication. Segments and data elements determined
to be extraneous for Medicare claims adjudication shall, however, be
retained by the A/B MACs (PartB) and DME MACs within its
store-and-forward repository (SFR). Incoming claims data shall be
subjected to standard syntax and applicable implementation guide (IG)
edits prior to being deposited in the SFR to assure non-compliant data
will not be forwarded on to another payer as part of the Medicare
crossover process. SFR data shall be re-associated with those data
elements used in Medicare claim adjudication, as well as with payment
data, to create an ASC X12 837 IG-compliant outbound\
COB/Medigap transaction. The shared systems shall always retain the data
in the SFR for a minimum of 6 months.

The ASC X12 837 institutional and professional implementation guides
require that claims submitted for secondary payment contain standard
claim adjustment reason codes (CARCs) to explain adjudicative decisions
made by the primary payer. For a secondary claim to be valid, the amount
paid by the primary payer plus the amounts adjusted by the primary payer
shall equal the billed amount for the services in the claim. A tertiary
payer to which Medicare may forward a claim may well need all data and
adjustment codes Medicare receives on a claim. A tertiary payer could
reject a claim forwarded by Medicare if the adjustment and payment data
from the primary payer or from Medicare did not balance against the
billed amounts for the services and the claim. As a result, shared
systems shall reject inbound Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) claims if
the paid and adjusted amounts do not equal the billed amounts and if the
claims lack standard CARCs to identify adjustments to the total amount
billed.

As a rule, the shared system maintainers shall populate an outbound
COB/Medigap file as an ASC X12 837 flat file with the Employer
Identification Number (EIN)/Tax ID or SSN (for a sole practitioner)
present in the provider's file, unless otherwise specified within
§70.6.5 or §70.6.6 of this chapter. With the adoption of the National
Provider Identifier (NPI), the shared system shall report qualifier XX
in NM108 and the NPI value in NM109. The shared system shall report the
provider's EIN/TAX ID within the REF segment of the billing provider
loop, as appropriate. In addition, unless otherwise stated within
§70.6.5 or §70.6.6 of this chapter, the shared systems shall populate
the provider loops on outbound ASC X12 837 claims with the provider's
first name, last name, middle initial, address, city, state and zip code
as contained in the Medicare provider files, the information for which
is derived from the Provider Enrollment Chain and Ownership System
(PECOS).

**[Background---Specific COBA Crossover Process]{.underline}**

The CMS has streamlined the claims crossover process to better serve its
customers. Under the consolidated

claims crossover process, trading partners execute national agreements
called Coordination of Benefits Agreements (COBAs) with CMS's BCRC.
Through the COBA process, each COBA trading partner will send one
national eligibility file that includes eligibility information for each
Medicare beneficiary that it insures to the BCRC. The BCRC will transmit
the beneficiary eligibility file(s) to the Common Working File (CWF) via
the HUBO maintenance transaction. The transaction is also termed the
"Beneficiary Other Insurance (BOI)" auxiliary file. (See Pub.100-04,
chapter 27, §80.4 for more details about the contents of the BOI
auxiliary file.)

During August 2003, the CMS modified CWF to accept both the HUBO (BOI)
transaction on a regular basis and COBA Insurance File (COIF) as a
weekly file replacement. Upon reading both the BOI and the COIF, CWF
applies each COBA trading partner's claims selection criteria against
processed claims with service dates that fall between the effective and
termination date of one or more BOI records.

Upon receipt of a BOI reply trailer (29) that contains (a) COBA ID (s)
and other crossover information required on the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) ASC X12 835 Electronic
Remittance Advice (ERA), all A/B MACs and DME MACs shall send processed
claims via an ASC X12 837 COB flat file or National Council for
Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) file to the BCRC. The BCRC, in turn,
will cross the claims to the COBA trading partner in the HIPAA ASC X12
837 or NCPDP formats, following its validation that the incoming
Medicare claims are formatted correctly and pass HIPAA or NCPDP
compliance editing.

In addition, CMS shall arrange for the invoicing of COBA trading
partners for crossover fees.

For more information regarding the COBA Medigap claim-based crossover
process, which was enacted on October 1, 2007, consult §70.6.4 of this
chapter.

**I. A/B MAC (Part A, Part B, or PartHHH) or DME MAC Actions Relating to
CWF Claims Crossover Exclusion Logic**

**A. Determination of Beneficiary Liability for Claims with Denied
Services**

Effective with the January 2005 release, the A/B MAC (PartB) and DME MAC
shared systems shall include an indicator "L" (beneficiary is liable for
the denied service\[s\]) or "N" (beneficiary is not liable for the
denied service\[s\]) in an available field on the HUBC and HUDC queries
to CWF for claims on which all line items are denied. The liability
indicators (L or N) shall be reflected at the header or claim level
rather than at the line level.

For purposes of applying the liability indicator L or N at the
header/claim level and, in turn, including such indicators in the HUBC
or HUDC query to CWF, the A/B MACs (PartB) and DME MAC shared systems
shall follow these business rules:

> •The L or N indicators are not applied at the header/claim level if
> any service on the claim is payable by Medicare;
>
> •The "L" indicator is applied at the header/claim level if the
> beneficiary is liable for any of the denied services on a fully denied
> claim; and
>
> •The "N" indicator is applied at the header/claim level if the
> beneficiary is not liable for all of the denied services on a fully
> denied claim.

Effective with October 2007, the CWF maintainer shall create a 1-byte
beneficiary liability indicator field within the header of its HUIP,
HUOP, HUHH, and HUHC Part A claims transactions (valid values for the
field="L," "N," or space).

As A/B MACs (PartA) and A/B MACs (PartHHH) adjudicate claims and
determine that the beneficiary has payment liability for any part of the
fully denied services or service lines, they shall set an "L" indicator
within the newly created beneficiary liability field in the header of
their HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, and HUHC claims that they transmit to CWF. In
addition, as A/B MACs (PartA) and A/B MACs (PartHHH) adjudicate claims
and determine that the beneficiary has no payment liability for any of
the fully denied services or service lines - that is, the provider must
absorb all costs for the fully denied claims - they shall include an "N"
beneficiary indicator within the designated field in the header of their
HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, and HUHC claims that they transmit to CWF. NOTE: A/B
MACs (PartA) and A/B MACs (PartHHH) shall not set the "L" or "N"
indicator on partially denied/partially paid claims.

Upon receipt of an HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, or HUHC claim that contains an "L"
or "N" beneficiary liability indicator, CWF shall read the COBA
Insurance File (COIF) to determine whether the COBA trading partner
wishes to receive "original" fully denied claims with beneficiary
liability (crossover indicator "G") or without beneficiary liability
(crossover indicator "F") or "adjustment" fully denied claims with
beneficiary liability (crossover indicator "U") or without beneficiary
liability (crossover indicator "T").

If CWF determines that the COBA trading partner wishes to exclude the
claim, as per the COIF, it shall suppress the claim from the crossover
process.

CWF shall post the appropriate crossover disposition indicator in
association with the adjudicated claim on the HIMR detailed history
screen (see §80.5of this chapter).

In addition, the CWF maintainer shall create and display the new 1-byte
beneficiary liability indicator field within the HIMR detailed history
screens (INPL, OUTL, HHAL, and HOSL), to illustrate the indicator ("L"
or "N") that appeared on the incoming HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, or HUHC claim
transaction.

**[CWF Editing for Incorrect Values]{.underline}**

If an A/B MAC (PartA) or A/B MAC (PartHHH) sends values other than "L,"
"N," or space in the newly defined beneficiary liability field in the
header of its HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, or HUHC claim, CWF shall reject the
claim back to the A/B MAC for correction. Following receipt of the CWF
rejection, the A/B MAC (PartA) and A/B MAC (PartHHH) shall change the
incorrect value placed within the beneficiary liability field and
retransmit the claim to CWF.

**B. Developing a Capability to Treat Entry Code "5" and Action Code "3"
Claims As Recycled "Original" Claims For Crossover Purposes**

Effective with July 2007, in instances when CWF returns an error code
5600 to an A/B MAC and DME MAC, thereby causing it to reset the claim's
entry code to "5" and action code to "3," the MAC shall set a newly
developed "N"(non-adjustment) claim indicator ("treat as an original
claim for crossover purposes") in the header of the HUBC, HUDC, HUIP,
HUOP, HUHH, and HUHC claim in the newly defined field before
retransmitting the claim to CWF. The A/B MAC and DME MAC shared system
shall then resend the claim to CWF.

Upon receipt of a claim that contains entry code "5" or action code "3"
with a non-adjustment claim header value of "N," the CWF shall treat the
claim as if it were an "original" claim (i.e., as entry code "1" or
action code "1") for crossover inclusion or exclusion determinations. If
CWF subsequently determines that the claim meets all other inclusion
criteria, it shall mark the claim with an "A" ("claim was selected to be
crossed over") crossover disposition indicator.

Following receipt of a Beneficiary Other Insurance (BOI) reply trailer
(29) for the recycled claim, the A/B MACs' and DME MACs' shared systems
shall ensure that, as part of their ASC X12 837 flat file creation

processes, they populate the 2300 loop CLM05-3 (Claim Frequency Type
Code) segment with a value of "1" (original). In addition, the A/B MACs'
and DME MACs' shared systems shall ensure that, as part of their ASC X12
837 flat file creation process, they do not create a corresponding 2330
loop REF\*T4\*Y segment, which typically signifies "adjustment."

**C. Developing a Capability to Treat Claims with Non-Adjustment Entry
or Action Codes as Adjustment Claims For Crossover Purposes**

Effective with July 2007, in instances where A/B MACs and DME MACs must
send adjustment claims to CWF as entry code "1" or as action code "1"
(situations where CWF has rejected the claim with edit 6010), they shall
set an "A" indicator in a newly defined field within the header of the
HUBC, HUDC, HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, or HUHC claim.

If A/B MACs and DME MACs send a value other than "A" or spaces within
the newly designated header field within their HUBC, HUDC, HUIP, HUOP,
HUHH, and HUHC claims, CWF shall apply an edit to reject the claim back
to the MAC. Upon receipt of the CWF rejection edit, the MACs' systems
shall correct the invalid value and retransmit the claim to CWF for
verification and validation.

Upon receipt of a claim that contains entry code "1" or action code "1"
with a header value of "A," the CWF shall take the following actions:\
•Verify that, as per the COIF, the COBA trading partner wishes to
exclude **either** adjustments, monetary adjustments, non-monetary, **or
both**; and

> •Suppress the claim if the COBA trading partner wishes to exclude
> **either** adjustments, monetary adjustments, non-monetary, **or
> both**.

**NOTE:** The expectation is that such claims do not represent mass
adjustments tied to the MPFS or mass adjustments-other.

If A/ B MACs and DME MACs receive a BOI reply trailer (29) on a claim
that had an "A" indicator set in its header, the A/B MACs' or DME MACs'
systems shall ensure that, as part of their ASC X12 837 flat file
creation processes, they populate the 2300 loop CLM05-3 ("Claim
Frequency Type Code") segment with a value that designates "adjustment"
rather than "original" to match the 2330B loop REF\*T4\*Y that they
create to designate "adjustment claim."

If an A/B MAC's or DME MAC's shared system does not presently create a
loop 2330B REF\*T4\*Y to designate adjustments, it shall not make a
change to do so as part of this instruction.

**[Correcting Invalid Claim Header Values Sent to CWF]{.underline}**

If A/B MACs and DME MACs send a value other than "A," "N," or spaces
within the newly designated header field within their HUBC, HUDC, HUIP,
HUOP, HUHH, and HUHC claims, CWF shall apply an edit to reject the claim
back to the A/B MAC or DME MAC. Upon receipt of the CWF rejection edit,
the A/B MACs' or DME MACs' systems shall correct the invalid value and
retransmit the claim to CWF for verification and validation.

**D. CWF Identification of National Council for Prescription Drug
Claims**

Currently, the DME MAC shared system is able to identify, through the
use of an internal indicator, whether a submitted claim is in the
National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) format.
Effective with January 2005, the DME MAC shared system shall pass an
indicator "P" to CWF in an available field on the HUDC query when the
claim is in the NCPDP format. The indicator "P" should be included in a
field on the HUDC that is separate from the fields used to indicate
whether a beneficiary is liable for all services that are

completely denied on his/her claim.

The CWF shall read the new indicators passed via the HUBC or HUDC
queries for purposes of excluding 100 percent denied claims with or
without beneficiary liability and NCPDP claims. After applying the
claims selection options, CWF will return a BOI reply trailer (29) to
the A/B MAC or DME MAC only in those instances when the COBA trading
partner expects to receive a Medicare processed claim from the BCRC.

Effective with July 2007, CWF shall reject claims back to DME MACs if
their HUDC claim contains a value other than "P" in the established
field used to identify NCPDP claims.

**E. CWF Identification and Auto-Exclusion of ASC X12 837 Professional
Claims That Contain Only Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI)
Codes**

Effective October 6, 2008, the CWF maintainer shall create space within
the header of its HUBC claim transmission for a 1-byte PQRI indicator
(valid values=Q or space).

In addition, CWF shall create a 2-byte field on page 2 of the HIMR claim
detail in association with the new category "COBA Bypass" for the value
"BQ," which shall designate that CWF auto-excluded the claim because it
contained only PQRI codes (see §80.*5* of this chapter for more details
regarding the bypass indicator).

Prior to transmitting the claim to CWF for normal processing, the A/B
MAC (Part B) shared system shall input the value "Q" in the newly
defined PQRI field in the header of the HUBC when **[all]{.underline}**
service lines on a claim contain PQRI (status M) codes.

Upon receipt of a claim that contains a "Q" in the newly defined PQRI
field (which signifies that the claim contains only PQRI codes on all
service detail lines, CWF shall auto-exclude the claim from the national
COBA eligibility file-based and Medigap claim-based crossover processes.
Following exclusion of the claim, CWF shall populate the value "BQ" in
association with the newly developed "COBA Bypass" field on page 2 of
the HIMR A/B MAC (Part B) and DME MAC claim detail screens.

Prior to October 6, 2008, all A/B MACs and DME MACs shall update any of
their provider customer service materials geared towards crossover
claims related inquiries to reflect the newly developed "BQ" by-pass
value, which designates that CWF auto-excluded the claim because it only
contained PQRI codes.

The Next Generation Desktop (NGD) contractor shall also modify its user
screens and documentation to reflect the new "BQ" code.

**F. CWF Identification and Exclusion of Claims Containing Placeholder
National Provider Identifiers (NPIs)**

Effective October 6, 2008, the CWF maintainer shall create space within
the header of its HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, HUHC, HUBC, and HUDC claims
transactions for a new 1-byte "NPI-Placeholder" field (acceptable
values=Y or space).

In addition, the CWF maintainer shall create space within page two (2)
of the HIMR detail of the claim screen for 1) a new category "COBA
Bypass"; and 2) a 2-byte field for the indicator "BN." (See Pub. 100-04,
chapter 27, §80.*5* for more details regarding the "BN" bypass
indicator.)

**NOTE:** With the implementation of the October 2008 release, the CWF
maintainer shall remove all current logic for placeholder provider
values with the implementation of this new solution for identifying
claims that contain placeholder provider values.

As A/B MACs and DME MACs adjudicate **non VA MRA** claims that fall
within any of the NPI placeholder requirements, their shared system
shall take the following combined actions:

> 1\) Input a "Y" value in the newly created "NPI Placeholder" field on
> the HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, HUHC, HUBC, or HUDC claim transaction if a
> placeholder value exists on or is created anywhere within the SSM
> claim record. **NOTE**: The A/B MAC and DME MAC shared systems shall
> include spaces within the "NPI Placeholder" field when the claim does
> not contain a placeholder NPI value; **and**
>
> 2\) Transmit the claim to CWF, as per normal requirements.

Upon receipt of claims where the NPI Placeholder field contains the
value "Y," CWF shall auto-exclude the claim from the national COBA
crossover process. In addition, CWF shallpopulate the value "BN" in
association with the newly developed "COBA Bypass" field on page 2 of
the HIMR Part B and DME MAC claim detail screen and on page 3 of the
HIMR intermediary claim detail screen. (See Pub.100-04, chapter 27,
§80.4 for more details.)

Prior to October 6, 2008, all A/B MACs and DME MACs shall update any of
their provider customer service materials geared towards crossover
claims related inquiries to reflect the newly developed "BN" by-pass
value, which designates that CWF auto-excluded the claim because it
contained a placeholder provider value.

The Next Generation Desktop (NGD) contractor shall also modify its user
screens and documentation to reflect the new "BN" code.

**G. New CWF Requirements for Other Federal Payers**

Effective with October 3, 2011, the CWF maintainer shall expand its
logic for "Other Insurance," which is COIF element 176, to include
TRICARE for Life (COBA ID 60000-69999) and CHAMPVA (COBA ID 80214),
along with State Medicaid Agencies (70000-79999), as entities eligible
for this exclusion.

Through these changes, if either TRICARE for Life or CHAMPVA wishes to
invoke the "Other Insurance" exclusion, and if element 176 is marked on
the COIF for these entities, CWF shall suppress claims from the national
COBA crossover process if it determines that the beneficiary has active
additional supplemental coverage.

As part of this revised "Other Insurance" logic for TRICARE and CHAMPVA,
CWF shall interpret "additional supplemental coverage" as including
entities whose COBA identifiers fall in any of the following ranges:

> 00001-29999 (Supplemental);\
> 30000-54999 (Medigap eligibility-based);\
> 80000-80213 (Other Insurer); and\
> 80215-88999 (Other Insurer).

The "Other Insurance" logic for State Medicaid Agencies includes all of
the following COBA ID ranges:

> 00001-29999 (Supplemental);\
> 30000-54999 (Medigap eligibility-based);\
> 60000-69999 (TRICARE);\
> 80000-80213 (Other Insurance)\
> 80214 (CHAMPVA)\
> 80215-88999 (Other Insurer).

NOTE: As of October 3, 2011, CWF shall now omit COBA ID range
89000-89999 as part of its Other Insurance logic for State Medicaid
Agencies.

CWF shall mark claims that it excludes due to "Other Insurance" with
crossover disposition indicator "M" when storing them within the CWF
claims history screens. (See §80.*5* of chapter 27 for additional
information concerning this indicator.)

**II. A/B MAC and DME MAC Actions Relating to CWF Claims Crossover
Inclusion or Inclusion/Exclusion Logic**

**A. Inclusion of Two Categories of Mass Adjustment Claims for Crossover
Purposes**

All A/ B MACs and DME MACs shall continue to identify mass adjustment
claims-MPFS and mass adjustment claims---other by including an "M" (mass
adjustment claims---MPFS) or "O" (mass adjustment claims---other) within
the header of the HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, HUHC, HUBC, and HUDC claim\
transactions, as specified in Pub.100-04, chapter 27, §80.*6*. (Refer to
Pub.100-04, chapter 27, §80.*8* for CWF specific requirements relating
to the unique inclusion of mass adjustment claims for crossover
purposes.)

Effective January 5, 2009, the BCRC, at CMS's direction, modified the
COIF to allow for the unique inclusion of mass adjustment claims---MPFS
updates and mass adjustment claims---other. The CWF maintainer shall 1)
create these new fields, along with accompanying 1-byte file
displacement, within its version of the COIF; and 2) accept and process
these new fields when the BCRC transmits them as part of its regular
COIF updates.

Upon receipt of a HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, HUHC, HUBC, or HUDC claim
transaction that contains an "M" or "O" mass adjustment indicator, CWF
shall undertake all additional actions with respect to determination as
to whether the claim should be included or excluded for crossover
purposes as specified in chapter 27, §80.8.

**[A/B MAC and DME MAC Flat File Requirements]{.underline}**

Before the A/B MAC and DME MAC shared systems send "mass adjustment
claims---MPFS" to the BCRC via an ASC X12 837 flat file transmission,
they shall take the following actions with respect to the fields that
correspond to the loop 2300 NTE01 and NTE02 segments on the ASC X12 837
COB flat file only if there was not a pre-existing 2300 NTE segment on
the incoming Medicare claim:

> 1\) Populate "ADD" in the field that corresponds to NTE01; and
>
> 2\) Populate "MP," utilizing bytes 01 through 02, in the field that
> corresponds to NTE02.

Before the A/B MAC and DME MAC shared systems send "mass adjustment
claims---other" to the BCRC via an ASC X12 837 flat file transmission,
they shall take the following actions with respect to the fields that
correspond to the loop 2300 NTE01 and NTE02 segments on the 837 COB flat
file only if there was not a pre-existing 2300 NTE segment on the
incoming Medicare claim:

> 1\) Populate "ADD" in the field that corresponds to NTE01; and
>
> 2\) Populate "MO," utilizing bytes 01 through 02, in the field that
> corresponds to NTE02.

**B. Inclusion and Exclusion of Recovery Audit Contractor
(RAC)-Initiated Adjustment Claims**

Effective January 5, 2009, at CMS's direction, the BCRC modified the
COIF to allow for the unique inclusion and exclusion of RAC-initiated
adjustment claims. The CWF maintainer shall 1) create these new fields,

along with accompanying 1-byte file dis-placement, within its version of
the COIF; and 2) accept and process these new fields when the BCRC
transmits them as part of its regular COIF updates. In addition, the CWF
maintainer shall create a 1-byte RAC adjustment value in the header of
its HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, HUHC, HUBC, and HUDC claims transactions (valid
values="R" or spaces).

Through this instruction, all A/B MAC and DME MAC shared systems shall
develop a method for uniquely identifying all varieties of RAC-requested
adjustments, which occur as the result of post-payment review
activities.

**NOTE**: Currently, fewer than five (5) MACs process RAC adjustments.

Prior to sending its processed 11X and 12X type of bill RAC-initiated
adjustment transactions to CWF for normal verification and validation,
the A/B MAC (PartA) and A/B MAC (Part HHH) shared system shall input the
"R" indicator in the newly defined header field of the HUIP claim
transaction if the RAC adjustment claim meets either of the following
conditions:

> 1)The claim resulted in Medicare changing its payment decision from
> paid to denied (i.e., Medicare paid \$0.00 as a result of the
> adjustment performed)**; or**
>
> 2)The claim resulted in a Medicare adjusted payment that falls below
> the amount of the inpatient hospital deductible.

Prior to sending RAC-initiated adjustment claims **with all other type
of bill designations to CWF** for normal processing, the A/ B MAC
(PartA) and A/B MAC (Part HHH) shared system shall input an "R"
indicator in the newly defined header field of the HUOP, HUHH, and HUHC
claim.

Prior to sending their processed RAC adjustment transactions to CWF for
normal verification and validation, the A/B MAC (PartB) and DME MAC
shared systems shall input the "R" indicator in the newly defined header
field of the HUBC and HUDC claim transactions.

**[Unique COBA ID Assignment to Trading Partners That Accept
RAC-Initiated Adjustment Claims]{.underline} [Only and Attendant A/B MAC
and DME MAC Responsibilities]{.underline}**

The BCRC will assign a unique COBA ID range (88000-88999) to COBA
trading partners that elect to "include" RAC-initiated adjustment claims
for crossover purposes and will not, at CMS's direction, charge the
trading partner the standard crossover fee for that category of
adjustment claims. Therefore, when A/B MACs and DME MACs receive a BOI
reply trailer (29) on a claim that contains only a COBA ID in the range
88000 through 88999 (which designates RAC adjustment), the A/B MAC and
DME MAC shall not expect payment for the claim.

Before the A/B MAC and DME MAC shared systems send "tagged"
RAC-initiated adjustment claims to the BCRC via an ASC X12 837 flat file
transmission, they shall take the following actions with respect to the
fields that correspond to the loop 2300 NTE01 and NTE02 segments on the
ASC X12 837 COB flat file only if there was **not** a pre-existing 2300
NTE segment on the incoming Medicare claim:

> 1\) Populate "ADD" in the field that corresponds to NTE01; and
>
> 2\) Populate "RA," utilizing bytes 01 through 02, in the field that
> corresponds to NTE02.

**III. CWF Crossover Processes In Association with the Coordination of
Benefits Contractor**

**A. CWF Processing of the COBA Insurance File (COIF) and Returning of
BOI Reply Trailers**

Effective July 6, 2004, the BCRC began to send initial copies of the
COBA Insurance File (COIF) to the nine CWF host sites. The COIF contains
specific information that will identify the COBA trading partner,
including name, COBA ID, address, and tax identification number (TIN).
It also contains each trading partner's claims selection criteria along
with an indicator (Y=Yes or N=No) of whether the trading partner wishes
its name to be printed on the Medicare Summary Notice (MSN). Effective
with the October 2004 systems release, the COIF also contains a 1-digit
Test/Production Indicator that will identify whether a COBA trading
partner is in test (T) or production (P) mode. The CWF shall return that
information as part of the BOI reply trailer (29) to A/B MACs and DME
MACs.

Upon receipt of a claim, CWF shall take the following actions:

> •Search for a COBA eligibility record on the BOI auxiliary record for
> each beneficiary and obtain the associated COBA ID(s) \[NOTE: There
> may be multiple COBA IDs associated with each\
> beneficiary.\];
>
> •Refer to the COIF associated with each COBA ID **NOTE**: The CWF
> shall pull the COBA ID from the BOI auxiliary record to obtain the
> COBA trading partner's name and claims selection criteria;

•Apply the COBA trading partner's selection criteria; and

> •Transmit a BOI reply trailer to the A/B MAC and DME MAC
> [only]{.underline} if the claim is to be sent, via 837 COB flat file
> or NCPDP file, to the BCRC to be crossed over.

**B. BOI Reply Trailer and Claim-based Reply Trailer Processes**

> **1. BOI Reply Trailer Process**
>
> For eligibility file-based crossover, all A/B MACs and DME MACs shall
> send processed claims information to the BCRC for crossover to a COBA
> trading partner in response to the receipt of a CWF BOI reply trailer
> (29). A/B MACs and DME MACs will only receive a BOI reply trailer (29)
> under the consolidated crossover process for claims that CWF has
> selected for crossover after reading each COBA trading partner's
> claims selection criteria as reported on the weekly COIF submission.
>
> When a BOI reply trailer (29) is received, the COBA assigned ID will
> identify the type of crossover (see the Data Elements Required for the
> BOI Aux File Record Table in Chapter 27, §24). Although each COBA ID
> will consist of a five-digit prefix that will be all zeroes, A/B MACs
> and DME MACs are only responsible for picking up the last five digits
> within these ranges, which will be right justified in the COBA number
> field. In addition to the trading partner's COBA ID, the BOI reply
> trailer shall also include the COBA trading partner name (s), an "A"
> crossover indicator that specifies that the claim has been selected to
> be crossed over, and a one-digit indicator \["Y"=Yes; "N"=No\] that
> specifies whether the COBA trading partner's name should be printed on
> the beneficiary MSN. As discussed above, effective with the October
> 2004 systems release, CWF shall also include a 1-digit Test/Production
> Indicator on the BOI reply trailer (29) that is returned to the A/B
> MACs and DME MACs.
>
> **[MSN Crossover Messages]{.underline}**
>
> Effective with the October 2004 systems release, the A/ B MACs and DME
> MACs began to receive BOI reply trailers (29) that contain an MSN
> indicator "Y" (Print trading partner name on MSN) or "N" (Do not print
> trading partner name on MSN).
>
> When a COBA trading partner is in full production (Test/Production
> Indicator=P), the A/ B MAC

and DME MAC shall read the MSN indicator returned on the BOI reply
trailer (29). If the A/B MAC or DME MAC receives an MSN indicator "N,"
it shall print its generic crossover message(s) on the MSN rather than
including the trading partner's name. Examples of existing generic MSN
messages include the following:

**(For all COBA ID ranges other than Medigap)**

MSN #35.1 - "This information is being sent to private insurer(s). Send
any questions regarding your benefits to them."

**(For the Medigap COBA ID range)**

MSN#35.2 - "We have sent your claim to your Medigap insurer. Send any
questions regarding your Medigap benefits to them."

Beginning with the October 2004 systems release, A/B MACs and DME MACs
shall follow these procedures when determining whether to update its
claims history to show that a beneficiary's claim was selected by CWF to

Effective January 5, 2009, when CWF returns a BOI reply trailer (29) to
an A/B MAC and DME MAC that contains only a COBA ID in the range 89000
through 89999, the A/B MAC and DME MAC shared system shall suppress all
crossover information, including name of insurer and generic
message#35.1, from all beneficiary MSNs.

A/B MACs and DME MACs shall not update their claims histories to reflect
transference of "tagged" claims with COBA ID range 89000 through 89999
to the BCRC.

**ASC X12 835 (Electronic Remittance Advice)/Provider Remittance Advice
Crossover Messages**

Beginning with the October 2004 release, when CWF returns a BOI reply
trailer (29) that contains a "T" Test/Production Indicator to the A/B
MACs and DME MACs, they shall not print information received from the
BOI reply trailer (29) in the required crossover fields on the ASC X12
835 Electronic Remittance Advice or other provider remittance advices
that are in production.

Beginning with the October 2004 release, when CWF returns a BOI reply
trailer (29) that contains a "P" Test/Production Indicator to the A/B
MACs and DME MACs, they shall use the returned BOI trailer information
to take the following actions on the provider's 835 Electronic
Remittance Advice:

> a\. Input code 19 in CLP-02 (Claim Status Code) in Loop 2100 (Claim
> Payment Information) of the 835 ERA (v. 4010-A1). \[NOTE: Record "20"
> in CLP-02 (Claim Status Code) in Loop 2100 (Claim Payment Information)
> when Medicare is the secondary payer.\]
>
> b\. Update the 2100 Loop (Crossover Contractor Name) on the 835 ERA as
> follows:

•NM101 \[Entity Identifier Code\]---Use "TT," as specified in the 835
Implementation Guide.

> •NM102 \[Entity Type Qualifier\]---Use "2," as specified in the 835
> Implementation Guide.
>
> •NM103 \[Name, Last or Organization Name\]---Use the COBA trading

**IV. A/B MAC and DME MAC Actions Relating to the Transition to the ASC
X12 837 Version 5010 and NCPDP Version D.O**

**A. CWF COIF and BOI Reply Trailer (29) Processes**

Effective January 5, 2009, the BCRC , at CMS's direction, created a new
1-byte "5010 Test/Production Indicator" and a new 1-byte "NCPDP D.0
Test/Production Indicator" on the COBA Insurance File \[COIF\] (valid
values= "N"---not applicable or not ready as yet; "T"---test;
"P"---production). In addition, the CWF maintainer shall add a new "5010
Test/Production Indicator" and an "NCPDP D.0 Test/Production Indicator"
to the BOI reply trailer (29) format. (See Pub.100-04 chapter 27,
§80.*7* for additional details regarding CWF requirements relating to
the new crossover claim formats.)

**B. Transmission of the COB Flat File or NCPDP File to the BCRC**

Regardless of whether a COBA trading partner is in test mode
(Test/Production Indicator returned via the BOI reply trailer 29=T) or
production mode (Test/Production Indicator returned via the BOI reply
trailer 29=P), A/B MACs and DME MACs shall transmit all non-NCPDP claims
received with a COBA ID via a BOI reply trailer to the BCRC in an ASC
X12 837 flat file, as described in Transmittal AB-03-060. In a separate
transmission, DME MACs shall send the claims received in the NCPDP file
format to the BCRC.

A/B MACs and DME MACs shall enter the 5-digit COBA ID picked up from the
BOI reply trailer (29) in the 1000B loop of the NM1 segment in the NM109
field. In a situation where multiple COBA IDs are received for a claim,
A/B MACs and DME MACs shall send a separate ASC X12 837 or NCPDP
transaction to the BCRC for each COBA ID. A/B MACs and DME MACs shall
perform the transmission at the end of their regular batch cycle, when
claims are removed from their payment floor, to ensure crossover claims
are not processed by the COBA trading partner prior to Medicare's final
payment. Transmission to the BCRC shall occur via Connect: Direct or
other CMS dictated connectivity.

Effective with October 4, 2005, when the A/B MAC and DME MAC shared
systems transfer processed claims to the BCRC as part of the COBA
process, they shall include an additional 1-digit alpha character
("T"=test or "P"=production) as part of the BHT03 identifier (Beginning
of the Hierarchical Transaction Reference Identification) that is
included within the ASC X12 837 flat file or NCPDP submissions. The
shared systems shall determine that a COBA trading partner is in test or
production mode by referring to the BOI reply trailer (29) originally
received from CWF for the processed claim. (See §70.6.1 of this chapter
for further details about the BHT03 identifier.)

Effective October 2, 2006, the Virtual Data Center (VDC), formerly the
Enterprise Data Centers (EDCs), shall transmit a combined COBA "test"
and "production" ASC X12 837 flat file and a combined "test" and
"production" NCPDP file, as applicable, to the BCRC.

**NOTE**: This requirement changes the direction previously provided in
October 2005 through the issuance of Transmittal 586.

**[Flat File Conventions for Transmission to the BCRC For Production
COBA Crossover Claims Prior]{.underline} [to July 2012]{.underline}**

With respect to ASC X12 837 COB flat file submissions to the BCRC, A/B
MACs (PartB) and DME MACs shall observe these process rules:

> The following segments shall not be passed to the BCRC:
>
> 1\. ISA (Interchange Control Header Segment);
>
> 2\. IEA (Interchange Control Trailer Segment);
>
> 3\. GS (Functional Group Header Segment); and
>
> 4\. GE (Functional Group Trailer Segment).

The 1000B loop of the NM1 segment denotes the crossover partner. If
multiple COBA IDs are received via the BOI reply trailer, the shared
system shall ensure that a separate ASC X12 837 transaction should be
submitted for each COBA ID received. As the crossover partner
information will be unknown to the standard systems, the following
fields should be formatted as indicated for the NM1 segment:

> NM103---Use spaces; and\
> NM109---Include COBA ID (5-digit COBA ID picked up from the BOI reply
> trailer 29).

The 2010BA loop denotes the subscriber information. If available, the
subscriber name, address, and policy number should be used to complete
the NM1, N3, and N4 segments. If unknown, the segments should be
formatted as follows, with BCRC completing any missing information:

> NM1 segment---For NM103, NM104, NM105, and NM107, use spaces;\
> NM1 segment---For NM109, include beneficiary's Medicare beneficiary
> identifier; N3 segment---Use all spaces; and\
> N4 segment---Use all spaces.

The 2010BB loop denotes the payer name. Per the HIPAA Implementation
Guide (IG), this loop should define the secondary payer when sending the
claim to the second destination payer. Consequently, given that the
payer related to the COBA ID will be unknown by the standard systems,
the NM1, N3, and N4 segments should be formatted as follows, with BCRC
completing any missing information:

> NM1 segment---For NM103, use spaces;\
> NM1 segment---For NM109, include the COBA ID (5-digit COBA ID picked
> up from the BOI reply trailer 29);\
> N3 segment---Use all spaces; and\
> N4 segment---Use all spaces.

The 2330B loop denotes other payers for the claim. If multiple COBA IDs
are returned via the BOI reply trailer, payer information for the
additional COBA IDs will be unknown. As with the 2010BB loop, the NM1
segment should be formatted as follows, with BCRC completing any missing
information:

> NM103---Use spaces; and\
> NM109---Include COBA ID (5-digit COBA ID picked up from the BOI reply
> trailer 29).

The 2330B loop shall be repeated to allow for the inclusion of the name
(NM103) and associated Trading Partner ID (NM109) for each existing
trading partner.

The 2320 loop denotes other subscriber information. Within the SBR
segment, the SBR03 and SBR04 segments are used to define the
group/policy number and insured group name, respectively. If the
information is available for these fields, those values should be
propagated accordingly for both current trading partners and COBA
trading partners. The BCRC will inspect these values for COBA related
eligibility based claims and overlay as appropriate. Spaces should only
be used for COBA-related situations.

> SBR01---Treat as normally do.

With respect to ASC X12 837 COB flat file submissions to the BCRC, A/B
MACs (Part A) and A/B MACs (Part HHH) shall observe these process rules:

> As the ISA, IEA, and GS segments are included in the "100" record with
> other required segments, the "100" record must be passed to the BCRC.
> However, as the values for these segments will be recalculated, spaces
> may be placed in all of the fields related to the ISA, IEA, and GS
> segments.

The 1000B loop of the NM1 segment denotes the crossover trading partner.
If multiple COBA IDs are received via the BOI reply trailer, the A/B MAC
or DME MAC system shall ensure that a separate 837 transaction should be
submitted for each COBA ID received. As the crossover trading partner
information will be unknown to the standard systems, the following
fields should be formatted as follows for the NM1 segment on the"100"
record:

> NM103---Use spaces; and\
> NM109---Include COBA ID (5-digit COBA ID picked up from the BOI reply
> trailer 29).

The 2010BA loop denotes the subscriber information. If available, the
subscriber name, address, and policy number should be used to complete
the NM1, N3, and N4 segments. If unknown, the segments should be
formatted as follows for the "300" record, with BCRC completing any
missing information:

> NM1 segment -- For NM103, NM104, NM105, and NM107, use spaces;\
> NM1 segment---For NM109, include beneficiary's Medicare beneficiary
> identifier; N3 segment---Use all spaces; and\
> N4 segment---Use all spaces.

The 2010BC loop denotes the payer name. Per the HIPAA IG, this loop
should define the secondary payer when sending the claim to the second
destination payer. Consequently, since the payer related to the COBA

ID will be unknown to the standard systems, the NM1, N3, and N4 segments
should be formatted as follows for the "300" record, with BCRC
completing any missing information:

> NM1 segment---For NM103, use spaces;\
> NM1 segment---For NM109, include COBA ID (5-digit COBA ID picked up
> from the BOI reply trailer 29);\
> N3 segment---Use all spaces; and\
> N4 segment---Use all spaces.

The 2330B loop of the "575" record denotes other payers for the claim.
If multiple COBA IDs are returned via the BOI reply trailer, payer
information for the additional COBA IDs will be unknown. As with the
2010BC loop, the NM1 segment should be formatted as follows, with BCRC
completing any missing information:

> NM103---Use spaces; and\
> NM109---Include COBA ID (5-digit COBA ID picked up from the BOI reply
> trailer 29).

The 2330B loop shall be repeated to allow for the inclusion of the name
(NM103) and associated Trading Partner ID (NM109) for each existing
trading partner.

The 2320 loop denotes other subscriber information. Within the SBR
segment, the SBR03 and SBR04 segments are used to define the
group/policy number and insured group name, respectively. If the
information is available for these fields, those values should be
propagated accordingly. The BCRC will inspect these values for COBA
related eligibility based claims and overlay as appropriate. Spaces
should only be used for COBA-related situations.

> SBR01---Treat as normally do.

**C. BCRC Processing of COB Flat Files or NCPDP Files**

Effective April 5, 2021, the COB&R system supporting the BCRC will
transmit modified dataset names to the VDCs for the COBA Claims Response
File (the File whereby the BCRC, through the COB&R system, conveys an
acceptance of the flat file with the value "A" or rejection of the file
with the value"R"). The VDCs shall be prepared to accept the following
modified dataset names effective April 5, 2021:

> **•**xxxx.FISP.HBADR.GHI.COB5RESP(+1) \[For 837 institutional
> claims\]\
> **•**xxxx.MCSP.HBXDR.ADyyCOBC(+1) \[For 837 non-DMEPOS professional
> claims\]\
> **•**xxxx.VMSP.COBC.A5010.ERROR.RESPONSE(+1) \[For 837 DMEPOS
> professional claims\] **•**Value is TBD \[For NCPDP Part B Drug
> Claims\] (**Note:** Since the implementation of NCPDP D.0 COB claims
> as part of COBA, the VDCs have [not]{.underline} been set up to
> receive NCPDP Claim Response Files.)

*Note the following definitions that apply to the above Claim Response
File dataset names:*

> **•***VDCx= directs the file to the appropriate VDC; VDC1 = CD1.EDC1;
> VDC3 = CD3.EDC1*
>
> **•***xxxx = High-level qualifier (HLQ) identifier currently used by
> the MAC* **•***yy = identifier currently used by and defined for Part
> B files for Plan Code*

When an A/B MAC and DME MAC receives the reject indicator "R" via the
Claims Response File, it is to retransmit the entire file to the BCRC.
If the A/B MAC or DME MAC receives an acceptance indicator "A," this
confirms that its entire COB flat file or NCPDP file transmission was
accepted. Once COB flat files or NCPDP files are accepted and translated
into the appropriate outbound format(s), BCRC will cross

the claims to the COBA trading partner. The format of the Claims
Response File that will be returned to each A/B MAC and DME MAC by the
BCRC, following its COB ASC X12 837 flat file or NCPDP file
transmission, appears in the table below. (See §70.6.1 for
specifications regarding the receipt and processing of the BCRC Detailed
Error Reports.)

Claims response files will be returned to A/B MACs and DME MACs after
receipt and initial processing of a claim file. Thus, for example, if an
A/B MAC or DME MAC sends a COB flat file daily via the VDC, the BCRC
will return a claim response file to that entity on a daily basis.

*Effective April 5, 2021,VDC-transmitted* ASC X12 COB 837 flat files and
NCPDP *filessubmitted* by the VDC on behalf of each A/B MAC and DME MAC,
as applicable, to *the CMS Baltimore Data Center (BDC) to, in turn, be
transmitted to theCoordination of Benefits & Recovery (COB&R) system
supporting BCRC* will be assigned the following file *dataset* names,
regardless of whether a COBA trading partner is in test or production
mode:

> •*P/T#EFT.ON.COBA.Cxxxxx.PARTA.Dyymmdd.Thhmmsst* \[For Institutional
> Claims}
>
> •*P/T#EFT.ON.COBA.Cxxxxx.PARTB.Dyymmdd.Thhmmsst* \[For Professional
> Claims\]
>
> •*P/T#EFT.ON.COBA.Cxxxxx.NCPDP.Dyymmdd.Thhmmsst* \[For *NCPDP Part B*
> Drug Claims\]

Note *thefollowing definitions that apply to the dataset names above:*

> **•***P/T= "P"---Production; "T"= Test*
>
> **•***Cxxxxx= C + the 5-digit MAC ID; e.g., 12302*
>
> **•***Dyymmdd.Thhmmsst = Current date and Time concatenated to
> literals D and T. (NOTE: This is* *optional for the VDCs to include,
> and if not present, CMS EFT will concatenate it.)*

A/B MACs and DME MACs shall perform the ASC X12 837 flat file and NCPDP
file transmission at the end of the regular batch cycle, when claims
come off the payment floor, to ensure crossover claims are not processed
by the trading partner prior to Medicare's final payment.

Files transmitted by the VDC to the BCRC shall be stored for 51 business
days from the date of

> transmission.
>
> The file names for the Claims Response File returned to the A/B MAC
> and DME MAC via the VDC will be created as part of the NDM set-up
> process.
>
> Outbound COB files transmitted by BCRC to the COBA trading partners
> will be maintained for 50 business days following the date of
> transmission.

> In order to track trading partner requests for research of 837 ASC X12
> issues, CMS requires A/B MACs and DME MACs to submit a COBA Problem
> Inquiry Request Form to the BCRC or CMS. This process is being
> implemented to reduce the number of duplicate issues being researched
> and to ensure your requests are processed timely. The standard form
> enables CMS and BCRC to track issues through completion and manage the
> process of addressing post-COBA production issues. Upon receipt the
> submitter shall receive a response from the BCRC with the assigned
> contact information.

> CMS is also requiring A/B MACs and DME MACs to use the COBA Problem
> Inquiry Request Form when requesting a BCRC representative to research

> **V. Identification of Mass Adjustments for COBA Crossover Purposes**
>
> All A/B MACs and DME MACs and their shared systems shall develop a
> method for differentiating "mass adjustments tied to the Medicare
> Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) updates" and "all other mass
> adjustments" from all other kinds of adjustments and non-adjustment
> claims.
>
> **NOTE:** For appropriate classification, all adjustments that do not
> represent "mass adjustments-MPFS" or "mass adjustments-other" shall be
> regarded as "other adjustments.") DME MACs and their shared system
> shall only be required to identify mass adjustments-other, which
> represents a current functionality available within VMS. This is
> because DME MACs do not use pricing from the MPFS when processing
> their claims.
>
> **[Working Definition of "Mass Adjustment"]{.underline}**
>
> For COBA crossover purposes, a "mass adjustment" refers to an action
> that an A/B MAC or DME MAC undertakes using special software (e.g.,
> Super-Op Events or Express Adjustments) to pull together claims with
> the anticipated purpose of making monetary changes to a high number of
> those claims. If, however, A/B MACs and DME MACs do not have special
> software to perform high volume adjustments (i.e., typically
> adjustments to 100 or more claims), but instead must perform their
> high volume adjustments manually, this action also fulfills the
> definition of a "mass adjustment."
>
> **Inputting a One-Byte Header Value on Claim Transactions to Designate
> Mass Adjustment and Associated Processes**
>
> Before A/B MACs and DME MACs cable their claims to CWF for
> verification and validation, they shall populate a 1-byte "mass
> adjustment" indicator in the header of their HUBC, HUDC, HUIP, HUOP,
> HUHH, or HUHC entry code "5" or action code "3" claim transactions.
> The CWF maintainer shall create a new 1-byte field within the header
> of its HUBC, HUDC, HUIP, HUOP, HUHH, or HUHC claims transactions for
> this purpose.

A/ B MACs and DME MACs shall determine whether the "M" or "O" indicator
applies in relation to a given claim at the point that they initiate a
mass adjustment action on that claim using a manual process or an
automated adjustment process; e.g., Super Op Events or Express
Adjustments. Upon making this determination, the A/B MACs and DME MACs
and their shared systems shall populate one (1) of the following mass
adjustment claim indicators, specific to the particular claim situation,
within the header of the A/B MACs or DME MACs' processed claims that
they will cable to CWF for verification and validation:

> "M"---if mass adjustment claim tied to an MPFS update;
> **[or]{.underline}**"O"---if mass adjustment claim-other.

If A/B MACs and DME MACs send values other than "M" or "O" within the
newly designated field within the header of their HUBC, HUDC, HUIP,
HUOP, HUHH, or HUHC entry code "5" or action code "3" claims, CWF shall
apply an edit to reject the claims back to the MAC. Upon receipt of the
CWF rejection edit, the shared systems shall correct the invalid value
and retransmit the claims to CWF for verification and validation.

**VI. Special ASC X12 835 Remittance Advice and MSN Requirements for
Health Care Pre-Payment Plans (HCPPs) and Health Maintenance
Organization (HMO) Cost Plans that Receive Crossover Claims**

Effective January 5, 2009, at CMS's direction, the BCRC assigned all
COBA HCPP and HMO Cost Plan participants a unique 5-byte COBA ID that
falls within the range 89000 through 89999. The CWF system shall accept
the reporting of this COBA ID range.

Upon receipt of a BOI reply trailer (29) that contains only a COBA ID in
the range 89000 through 89999, the A/B MAC and DME MAC shared systems
shall suppress [all]{.underline} crossover information (including name
of the insurer; generic message; and specific code (for ASC X12 835,
code MA-18; for MSN, code 35.1) indicating that the claim will be
crossed over) from the associated ASC X12 835 remittance advice and
beneficiary MSN. (See §70.6.1 of this chapter for A/B MAC or DME MAC
requirements relating to the BCRC Detailed Error Report processes and
receipt of claims that contain COBA ID range 89000 through 89999.)

**VII. Special Suppression Requirements for Part A Credit Claim Portion
of Debit-Credit Claim Pairing**

Effective with the April 2009 release, the A/B MAC (Part A) and A/B MAC
(Part HHH) shared system shall suppress sending the credit claim portion
of the debit-credit pairing (that transaction which cancels the original
claim) associated with each affiliated A/B MAC's (A, HHH) adjustment
claims to the BCRC. Upon suppressing the credit claim, the A/B MAC (Part
A) and A/B MAC (Part HHH) system shall mark the claims history of its
affiliate MAC to reflect this action.

**70.6.1 - Coordination of Benefits Agreement (COBA) Detailed Error
Report Notification Process**\
***(Rev. 11939; Issued:04-05-23; Effective:07-06-23,
Implemtation:07-06-23)***

The term Medicare beneficiary identifier (Mbi) is a general term
describing a beneficiary\'s Medicare identification number. For purposes
of this manual, Medicare beneficiary identifier references both the
Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) and the Medicare Beneficiary
Identifier (MBI) during the new Medicare card transition period and
after for certain business areas that will continue to use the HICN as
part of their processes.

Effective with the July 2005 release, CMS implemented an automated
process to notify physicians/ practitioners, suppliers, and providers
that specific claims that were previously tagged by the Common

Working File (CWF) for crossover will not be crossed over due to claim
data errors. Claims transmitted via ASC X12 837 flat file by the A/B MAC
and DME MAC shared systems to the Benefits Coordination & Recovery
Center (BCRC) may be rejected at the flat file level, at a HIPAA ASC X12
pre-edit validation level, or by trading partners as part of a financial
dispute arising from an invoice received.

Effective with the April 2005 release, the A/B MAC and DME MAC shared
systems began to populate the BHT 03 (Beginning of Hierarchical
Reference Identification) portion of their ASC X12 837 COB flat file
submissions to the BCRC with a unique 22-digit identifier. This unique
identifier will enable the BCRC to successfully tie a claim that is
rejected by the BCRC at the flat file or HIPAA ASC X12 pre-edit
validation levels as well as claims disputed by trading partners back to
the original ASC X12 837 flat file submissions.

Effective October 4, 2005, A/ B MACs and DME MACs and their shared
systems began to receive notification via the BCRC Detailed Error
Reports, whose file layout structures appear below, that a COBA trading
partner is in test or production mode via the BHT 03 identifier that is
returned from the BCRC.

Effective April 3, 2011, all A/B MACs and DME MACs shall include an
extra 1-byte "Original versus Adjustment Claim Indicator" value within
the BHT03 identifier on all ASC X12 837 institutional and professional
claims they transmit to the *BCRC* for crossover purposes. The BCRC
shall, in turn, return this value to the appropriate A/B MAC and DME MAC
via the BCRC Detailed Error Report process. In addition, the DME MAC
shared system shall send an additional 1-byte value (defined as
"reserved for future use") as spaces in field 504-F4 (Message) of the
NCPDP flat file sent to the BCRC. The BCRC shall, in turn, also return
this value to the appropriate DME MAC via the BCRC Detailed Error Report
process.

Effective April 1, 2013, CMS added a new 1-byte Original versus
Adjustment indicator to the suite of possible 1-byte options for
position 23 of the BHT03 identifier, as reflected below.

Effective with April 7, 2014, CMS has added 2 new 1-byte Original versus
Adjustment indicators to the suite of possible options for position 23
of the BHT03 identifier, as reflected below.

**A. Inclusion of the Unique 23**-**Digit Identifier on the ASC X12 837
Flat File and NCPDP File**

**1.Populating the BHT 03 Portion of the ASC X12 837 Flat File**

The A/B MAC and DME MAC shared systems shall populate the BHT 03
(Beginning of Hierarchical Transaction Reference Identification; **field
length=30 bytes**) portion of their ASC X12 837 flat files that are sent
to the BCRC for crossover with a 23-digit Contractor Reference
Identifier (CRI). The identifier shall be formatted as follows:

> a.A/B MAC or DME MAC number (9-bytes; until the 9-digit MAC number is
> used, report the 5-digit MAC number, left-justified, with spaces for
> the remaining 4 positions);
>
> b.Julian date as YYDDD (5 bytes);
>
> c.Sequence number (5 bytes; this number begins with "00001," so the
> sequence number should increment for each ST-SE envelope, which is
> specific to a trading partner, on a given Julian date);
>
> d.Claim version indicator (2 bytes, numeric, to denote claim version)\
> \*\*Acceptable values = 50 (for ASC X12 claims), and 20 (for NCPDP D.0
> claims);
>
> e.COBA Test/Production Indicator (1-byte alpha indicator; acceptable
> values = "T" \[test\] and "P" \[production\]) or "R" if the claims
> were recovered for a "production" COBA trading partner (see §70.6.3 of
> this chapter for more details;
>
> f.Original versus Adjustment Claim Indicator (1-byte alpha indicator);
> acceptable values are defined as the following:
>
> E - for reprocessed claims that formerly included an electronic
> prescribing (e-RX) negative adjustment amount;
>
> O - for original claims;
>
> P - for Affordable Care Act or other congressional imperative mass
> adjustments;
>
> M - for non-Affordable Care Act mass adjustments tied to Medicare
> Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS);
>
> S - for mass adjustment claims---all others;
>
> R - for RAC adjustment claims*;*
>
> A - for routine adjustment claims, not previously classified*;* and C
> -- for CMS-directed mass adjustment action (use specified by CMS).
>
> The following indicator is only applicable to FISS-generated claims:
> V - Void/cancel only claim

The 23-digit CRI shall be left-justified in the BHT 03 segment of the
837 flat file, with spaces used for the remaining 8 positions.
(**NOTE:** The CRI is unique inasmuch as no two files should ever
contain the same combination of numbers.)

**2. NCPDP 23-Digit Unique Identifier**

Effective April 3, 2011, the DME MAC shared system shall also adopt a
unique 23-digit format, referenced directly above under "Populating the
BHT 03 Portion of the ASC X12 837 Flat File." However, prior to April 7,
2014, the system shall populate the unique 23-digit identifier (defined
as "future use") with spaces in field 504-F4 (Message) within the NCPDP
file (field length=35 bytes). The DME MAC shared system shall populate
the unique identifier, left justified, in the field. Spaces shall be
used for the remaining bytes in the field.

Effective April 7, 2014, the DME MAC shared system shall ensure that its
DME MACs have the ability to 1) execute actions that will result in the
transmission of their HUDC claims to CWF with Mass Adjustment Indicator
set to "O"; and 2) transmit mass adjusted NCPDP D.0 COB claims to the
BCRC under a 504-F04 (Message) field identifier of \"C\" (CMS-directed
mass adjustment action) or \"P\" (mass adjustments tied to Affordable
Care Act or Congressional/legislative mandate) as appropriate to the
situation.

In addition, the DME MAC shared system shall ensure that all NCPDP D.0
crossover claims will now be sent to the BCRC with the 23rd byte 504-F04
(Message) field indicator completed, when appropriate, as indicated
below.

> O \-- for all \"original\" NCPDP D.0 claims transmitted;
>
> A\-- for \"routine adjustment claims\" transmitted; and
>
> R\-- for recovery audit claims (RAC) adjustment claims transmitted.

**B. BCRC Institutional, Professional, and NCPDP Detailed Error
Reports**

The A/B MAC and DME MAC shared systems shall accept the BCRC
Institutional, Professional, and NCPDP Detailed Error Reports received
from the COB&R system supporting the BCRC.

Effective with April 5, 2021, the datasets that the COB&R system
supporting BCRC will use to convey the BCRC Detailed Error Reports to
the VDCs representing the MACs are as follows:

> xxxx.FISP.HBADR.GHI.COB5ERR(+1) \[For Institutional Claims\]\
> xxxx.MCSP.HBXDR.ADyy5ERC(+1) \[For Professional non-DMEPOS Claims\]
> xxxx.VMSP.COBC.A5010.ERROR.FILE(+1) \[For Professional DMEPOS Claims\]

The formats for each of the Detailed Error Reports appear below.

Beginning with July 2007, all A/B MAC and DME MAC systems shall no
longer interpret the percentage values received for ASC X12 837
institutional and professional claim "222" and "333" errors via the BCRC
Detailed Error Reports as if the values contained a 1-position implied
decimal (e.g., "038" =3.8 percent).

DME MACs shall also no longer interpret the percentage values received
for NCPDP claims for "333" errors via the BCRC Detailed Error Report for
such claims as if the values should contain a 1-position implied
decimal.

In addition, A/B MACs and their systems shall now base their
decision*-*making calculus for initiation of a claims repair of "111"
(flat file) errors upon the number of errors received rather than upon
an established percent parameter, as otherwise described within this
section.

Effective with July 2009, the A/B MAC and DME MAC shared systems shall
accept the modified versions of the BCRC Detailed Error Reports for
institutional and professional claims as reflected below. As part of the
July 2009 changes, the BCRC will, at CMS's direction, expand the length
of the "error description" field. (**NOTE:** This means that the shared
systems shall therefore include the expanded error description code as
part of their special provider notification letters.)

**The Institutional Error File Layout, including summary portion, will
be used for Part A claim files.**

If the BCRC has rejected back to the A/B MAC and DME MAC shared system
for 2 or more COBA Identification Numbers (IDs), the shared system shall
receive a separate error record for each COBA ID. Also, if a file
submission from a shared system to the BCRC contains multiple provider,
subscriber, or patient level errors for one COBA ID, the shared system
will receive a separate error record for each provider, subscriber, or
patient portion of the file on which errors were found.

**C. Further Requirements of the COBA Detailed Error Report Notification
Process**

**1. Error Source Code**

A/B MACs and DME MACs, or their shared systems, shall use all
information supplied in the BCRC Detailed Error Report (particularly
error source codes provided in Field 10 of Attachment B) to (1) identify
shared system changes necessary to prevent future errors in test mode or
production mode (Test/Production Indicator= T or P) and (2) to notify
physicians, suppliers, and providers that claims with the error source
codes "111," "222," and "333" will not be crossed over to the COBA
trading partner.

**2. Time Frames for Notification of All MACs Financial Management Staff
and Providers**

A/B MACs and DME MACs, or their shared systems, shall provide
notification to MAC financial management staff for purposes of
maintaining an effective reconciliation of crossover fee/ complementary
credits received within five (5) business days of receipt of the BCRC
Detailed Error Report.

Effective with the October 2005 release, A/B MACs and DME MACs and their
shared systems shall receive BCRC Detailed Error Reports that contain
BHT03 identifiers that indicate "T" (test) or "P" (production)

status for purposes of fulfilling the provider notification
requirements. (**[Note:]{.underline}** The "T" or the P" portion of the
BHT03 indicator will be identical to the Test/Production indicator
originally returned from CWF on the processed claim.)

a\) **Special Automated Provider Correspondence**

A/B MACs and DME MACs, or their shared systems, shall also take the
following actions indicated below [only]{.underline} when they determine
via the Beneficiary Other Insurance (BOI) reply trailer (29) that a COBA
trading partner is in crossover production mode with the BCRC
(Test/Production Indicator=P). After an A/B MAC or DME MAC, or its
shared system, has received a BCRC Detailed Error Report that contains
claims with error source codes of "111" (flat file error)*,* "222"
(HIPAA ASC X12 error), or "333" (trading partner dispute), it shall take
the following two specified actions within five (5) business days:

> 1.Notify the physician/practitioner, supplier, or provider via
> automated letter *or other electronic or automated method* that the
> claim did not cross over. The letter *or report/notification*shall
> include specific claim information, not limited to, Internal Control
> Number (ICN)/Document Control Number (DCN), Medicare beneficiary
> identifier, Medical Record Number (for Part A only), Patient Control
> Number (only if it is contained in the claim), beneficiary name, date
> of service, and the date claim was processed.
>
> 2.Effective with July 2007, A/B MACs and DME MACs and their systems
> shall ensure that, in addition to the standard letter language (the
> claim(s) was/were not crossed over due to claim data errors and
> was/were rejected by the supplemental insurer), their A/B MACs' and
> DME MACs' special provider letters *or* reports*/notifications*, which
> are generated for '222' and '333' error rejections in accordance with
> CR 4277, now include the following additional elements, as derived
> from the BCRC Detailed Error Report: 1) HIPAA H-series rejection code
> or other rejection code, and 2) the rejection code's accompanying
> description.
>
> **NOTE:** A/B MACs or DME MACs, or their shared systems, are **not**
> required to reference the COBA trading partner's name on the above
> described automated letter *or report/notification*, since the
> original remittance advice (RA)/electronic remittance advice (ERA)
> would have listed that information, if appropriate.
>
> 2\. Update its claims history to reflect that the claim(s) did not
> cross over as a result of the generation of the automated letter *or
> report.*
>
> Effective with October 1, 2007, all A/B MACs and DME MACs shall modify
> their special provider notification letters that are generated for
> "111," "222," and "333" error situations to include the following
> standard language within the opening paragraph of their letters *or
> reports*: "This claim(s) was/were not crossed over due to claim data
> errors or was/were rejected by the supplemental insurer."
>
> A/B MACs and DME MACs shall reformat their provider notification
> letters *or reports*to ensure that, in addition to the new standard
> letter language, they continue to include the rejection code and
> accompanying description, as derived from the BCRC Detailed Error
> Report, for "222" or "'333" errors in association with each errored
> claim.
>
> Effective with the July 7, 2009, release, upon receipt of the BCRC
> Detailed Error Report (DER), the A/B MAC (A) and A/B MAC (HH) shared
> system shall configure the existing 114 report, as derived from the
> BCRC DER, so that it*:* 1) continues to display in landscape format;
> and 2) includes a cover page that contains the provider's
> correspondence mailing address.

b\) Special Exemption from Generating Provider Notification
Letters*/Reports*

> Effective July 7, 2008, upon their receipt of BCRC Detailed Error
> Reports that contain "222" error codes 000100 ("Claim is contained
> within a BHT envelope previously crossed; claim rejected") and 00010
> ("Duplicate claim; duplicate ST-SE detected"), all shared systems
> shall automatically suppress generation of the special provider
> notification letters *or reports/notifications*that they would
> normally generate for their associated A/B MACs and DME MACs in
> accordance with the requirements of this section as well as §70.6.3 of
> this chapter. In addition, upon receipt of BCRC Detailed Error Reports
> that contain "333" (trading partner dispute) error code 000100
> (duplicate claim) or 000110 (duplicate ISA-IEA) or 000120 (duplicate
> ST-SE), all shared systems shall automatically suppress generation of
> the special provider notification letters *or reports/notifications*,
> as would normally be required in accordance with this section as well
> as §70.6.3 of this chapter.
>
> **NOTE:** When suppressing their provider notification letters *or
> reports/notifications* for the foregoing qualified situations, the A/B
> MACs and DME MACs shall also not update their claims histories to
> reflect the non-crossing over of the associated claims. A/B MACs and
> DME MACs should, however, continue to *account for*the volume of
> claims that they are suppressing for financial reconciliation
> purposes.
>
> Effective with October 6, 2008, when the BCRC returns the "222" error
> code "N22225" to A/B MACs and DME MACs via the BCRC Detailed Error
> Report, the A/B MACs and DME MACs' shared systems shall suppress
> generation of the special provider notification letters *or*\
> *reports/notifications* that they would normally issue in accordance
> with CRs 3709 and 5472.
>
> When suppressing their provider notification letters *or
> reports/notifications*following their receipt of a "N22225" error
> code, the A/B MACs' and DME MACs' shared systems shall also not update
> their claims histories to reflect the non-crossing over of the
> associated claims. A/B MACs and DME MACs should, however, continue to
> *account for*the volume of claims that they are suppressing for
> financial reconciliation purposes.
>
> Effective with January 5, 2009, when the BCRC returns claims on the
> BCRC Detailed Error Report whose COBA ID falls in the range 89000
> through 89999 (range designates "Other-Health Care Pre-payment Plan
> \[HCPP\] and HMO Cost Plan"), the A/B MACs' and DME MACs' systems
> shall take the following actions:
>
> 1\) Suppress generation of the special provider letters *or
> reports/notifications*; and
>
> 2\) Not update their affiliated A/B MACs and DME MACs' claims
> histories to indicate that the BCRC will **not** be crossing the
> affected claims over.

07-03-17)**

Effective with the implementation of the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) ASC X12 837 5010 COB requirements, the
*BCRC* will return the error codes shown in the chart below to all A/B
MACs and DME MACs whose flat file submissions lack structural elements
necessary for the building of outbound HIPAA compliant crossover claims.

The shared systems shall, in addition, make modifications to any "111"
error tables that they maintain, in accordance with the following
charts, [only]{.underline} in association with ASC X12 837 5010 COB flat
files.

**70.6.2 -- Coordination of Benefits Agreement (COBA) Full Claim File
Repair Process (Rev. 4069, Issued: 06-08-18, Effective: 07-09- 8,
Implementation: 07-09-18)**

Effective with the July 2006 release, CMS implemented a full claim file
repair process at its A/B MACs and DME MACs to address situations where
one or more of the MAC shared systems inadvertently introduced a severe
error condition into the claims processing cycle, with the effect being
that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) ASC
X12 837 Coordination of Benefits (COB) Institutional and Professional
crossover claims files or National Council for Prescription Drug
Programs (NCPDP) claim files become unusable for COB purposes**.**

When an A/B MAC or DME MAC, the *BCRC,* or a COBA trading partner
identifies a shared system problem that will prevent, or has prevented,
the COBA trading partner from accepting an ASC X12 837 COB institutional
or professional claims file from the *BCRC*, the A/B MAC and DME MAC
shall work with its shared system maintainer to assess the feasibility
of executing a full claim file repair. A/B MACs and DME MACs shall
utilize the *BCRC* Detailed Error Reports to determine the percentage of
errors present for each error source code---"111" (flat file) errors,
"222" (ASC X12 837 COB) errors, and "333" (trading partner dispute)
errors. When A/B MACs and DME MACs or their shared system maintainers
determine that the error percentages are at or above the parameters
discussed later within this section, the A/B MACs and DME MACs shall
begin the process of analyzing the claim files for a possible full claim
repair process.

If the A/B MACs and DME MACs and their shared systems subsequently
initiate a full claim file repair process, that process shall be
accomplished within a maximum of 14 work days, unless determined
otherwise by CMS.

Effective July 2, 2007, A/B MACs and DME MACs and their systems shall
now base their decision making calculus for initiation of a claims
repair of "111" (flat file) errors upon the number of errors received
rather than upon an established percent parameter, as specified in
§70.6.1 of this chapter. If an A/B MAC or DME MAC receives even one (1)
"111" error via the *BCRC* Detailed Error Report, the MAC, working with
its Data Center or shared system as necessary, shall immediately attempt
a repair of the claims file, in accordance with all other requirements
communicated within this section.

**1. A/B MAC or DME MAC or Shared System Identification of a Full Claim
File Problem and Subsequent Actions**

When an A/B MAC or DME MAC, working with its shared system maintainer,
identifies a severe error condition that will negatively impact the
claims that it has transmitted to the *BCRC*, the A/ B MAC or DME MAC
shall, upon detection, immediately notify CMS and the *BCRC* by calling
current *BCRC* or CMS COBA crossover contacts and sending e-mail
communications to: and

The A/B MAC or DME MAC shall work closely with its system maintainer to
determine the timeframes for developing, testing, and applying a fix to
correct the severe error(s) that was/were identified within the 837 or
NCPDP files that were previously transmitted to the *BCRC*. The A/B MAC
and DME MAC shared system maintainers shall then report the timeframes
for developing, testing, and applying a fix to the full claim file
problem in accordance with their procedures as outlined in their systems
maintenance contract. If CMS determines that the time frames for
affecting a full claim file repair of the previously transmitted claims
exceed what is considered reasonable (a maximum of 14 work days, unless
determined otherwise by CMS), a designated COBA team representative will
notify the A/B MACs and DME MACs and their shared system maintainers via
e-mail to abort the full claim file repair process. (**NOTE**: This
process will remain unchanged with the transition to future claim
versions.)

Upon receipt of a notification from the CMS COBA team representative
that indicates that the timeframes for fixing a full claim file problem
exceed those that are acceptable to CMS, the A/B MACs' and DME MACs'
shared systems shall abort the full claim file repair process. A/B MACs
and DME MACs shall then

follow the requirements provided in §70.6.1 of this chapter with respect
to the special provider notification and other COBA crossover
operational processes. In such cases, however, A/B MACs and DME MACs
shall not be required to wait the customary five (5) business days
before generating the special provider notification letters to their
affected physicians, suppliers, or other providers of service.

**2. Alerting A/B MACs or DME MACs to the Possible Need for a Full Claim
File Repair via the BCRC Detailed Error Reports and Subsequent MAC
Actions**

**a. Severe Error Percentage Parameters and Suppression of the Special
Provider Notification Letters**

> Effective with July 2006, the CMS, working in conjunction with the
> *BCRC*, modified the *BCRC* Detailed Error Report layouts, as found in
> §70.6.1 of this chapter, to include the following new elements: Total
> Number of Claims for Date of Receipt; Total Number of "111" (flat
> file) Errors and corresponding percentage; Total Number of "222"
> (HIPAA ASC X12 837 COB) Errors and corresponding percentage; and Total
> Number of "333" (trading partner dispute) Errors and corresponding
> percentage.
>
> Effective with July 2007, CMS directed its A/B MACs and DME MACs to
> now base their severe error decision calculus upon the number of "111"
> errors received rather than percentage of such errors. Therefore, when
> an A/B MAC or DME MAC or its shared system maintainer receives a
> *BCRC* Detailed Error Report that indicates that the trading partner
> is in production and the number of "111" (flat file) errors is equal
> to or greater than one, the A/ B MAC's and DME MAC's shared system
> shall suppress the generation of special provider notifications, as
> provided in § 70.6.1 of this chapter, until after the severe error

**b. Additional Information Highlighting Possible Severe Error
Conditions on the BCRC Detailed** **Error Reports.**

> Effective with July 2006, the *BCRC* will report one of the following
> error sources and error codes/trading partner dispute codes that may
> be indicative of a severe error condition on the returned *BCRC*
> Institutional and Professional Detailed Error Reports:

**c. A/B MAC and DME MAC Actions Following Suppression of the Special
Provider Notification** **Letters to Analyze Possible Severe Error
Conditions**

> When A/B MACs and DME MACs receive *BCRC* Detailed Error Reports that
> contain "222" or "333" errors with percentages that are at or above
> the established parameters---or if the MACs receive "111" errors that

> provider notification letters to their affected
> physicians/practitioners, suppliers, or other providers of service.
>
> In the event that CMS indicates that a full claim file repair process

> ability to cancel the generation of the provider notification letters,
> as stipulated in §70.6.1 of this chapter, for the "repaired" claims
> **and** only generate the provider notification letters for the claims
> containing legitimate 111, 222, or 333 errors not connected with the
> severe error condition(s).

**3. Steps for Ensuring that Only "Repaired" Claims are Re-transmitted
to the BCRC**

Once the A/B MACs and DME MACs' shared systems have determined that they
are able to affect a "timely" repair to the full claim files that were
previously transmitted to the *BCRC*, they shall take the following
actions:

> a)Apply the fix to the unusable claims;
>
> b)Compare the claims files previously sent to the *BCRC* with the
> repaired claims file to isolate the claims that previously did **not**
> contain the error condition(s);
>
> c)Strip off the claims that did not contain the error condition(s),
> including claims that contained 111, 222, and 333 errors that were not
> connected with the severe error condition(s). For the latter set of
> claims (those with 111, 222, and 333 errors that were not connected to
> the severe error condition), MACs shall then generate the provider
> notification letters, as stipulated in §70.6.1 of this chapter and
> specified in the concluding paragraph of the above sub-section
> entitled, "Contractor Actions Following Suppression of the Special
> Provider Notification Letters to Analyze Possible Severe Error
> Conditions";
>
> d)Recreate the job; and
>
> e)Send only the "repaired" claims to the *BCRC*.

The shared systems shall add an indicator"18" to the BHT02 (Beginning of
the Hierarchical\
Transaction/Transaction Set Purpose Code) segment of the HIPAA ASC X12
837 flat file to designate that the file contains only repaired claims.
In addition, the shared systems shall include the repaired claims in
different ST-SE envelopes to differentiate the repaired claims from
normal ASC X12 837 flat file transmissions.

The DME MAC shared system shall add an indicator "R" after the COBA ID
reported in the Batch Header Record in the Receiver ID field (field
number 880-K7) of the NCPDP claim when transmitting the repaired claims
to the *BCRC*.

**4. COBA Repair Process Changes Effective with July 2012**

**A.** **[Repairing Flat File ("111") Errors]{.underline}**\
All A/B MACs and DME MACs shall effectuate repair of even one "111"
errored COB claim if the COBA trading partner is currently in
"production" mode. (**NOTE:** Parties interested in previewing a listing
of all "111" errors that the *BCRC* will apply to incoming COB flat
files should refer to §70.6.1.1 of this chapter.) The shared systems
shall accept the "111" error codes (see §70.6.1.1 of this chapter) that
the *BCRC* generates during its application of business level editing to
incoming ASC X12 837 COB flat files. The shared systems shall also make
modifications to any "111" error tables that they maintain
**[only]{.underline}** in association with ASC X12 837 COB flat files.

**IMPORTANT:** A/B MACs and DME MACs shall **[only]{.underline}** issue
special provider notification letters in association with their receipt
of "111" errors if: 1) the timeframe for effectuating a claims repair
falls outside acceptable parameters (e.g., will take 30-60 days or
longer); and 2) the volume of affected claims is low (i.e., under 1,000
claims per week). A/B MAC and DME MAC crossover contacts should contact
a member of the CMS COBA team if they have questions regarding how they
should proceed in association with a given "111" error situation.

**B.** **[Repairing "222" and "333" Errors Associated With "Production"
New Version Format Claims]{.underline}**

A/B MACs and DME MACs and their shared systems shall repair "222" or
"333" errors in association with "production" new format version claims
if the error percentage they encounter meets or exceeds four (4)
percent.

A/B MACs and DME MACs shall alert their shared system or Data Center, as
per established protocol, for purposes of initiating each needed claims
repair process in association with new format version COB claims.

**IMPORTANT:** A/B MACs and DME MACs that wish to effectuate a repair of
new format version "production" claims whose error percentage falls
below four (4) percent shall contact a member of the CMS COBA team
before attempting that action. (**NOTE:** As a rule, CMS will grant
approval for such a repair if the volume of errored claims justifies
that action **[and]{.underline}** if the timeframe for repair is
acceptable.)

In accordance with §70.6.1 of this chapter, A/B MACs and DME MACs shall
issue special provider notification letters in those instances where 1)
error percentages for "222" and "333" errors fall below four (4)
percent; 2) the volume of errors on "production" new format version COB
is **not** substantial enough to cause the A/B MAC or DME MAC to request
a claims repair; or 3) the timeframes for claim repair, as determined by
the associated shared system, are **not** acceptable to CMS.

**C.** **[Generally Applicable Requirements]{.underline}**

While A/B MACs and DME MACs are [**not**]{.underline} expected to
initiate the repair of "test" claims, they shall*:* 1) continue to
monitor the *BCRC* Detailed Error Reports; and 2) notify their shared
systems of errors returned so that necessary shared system changes to
improve HIPAA compliance rates may be realized.

**D.** **[New Date Parameter Logic and Cutover Claims Repair
Requirements]{.underline}**

To ensure appropriate cutover to the HIPAA ASC X12 COB flat file format,
all shared systems shall develop new date parameter logic to become
operational as of January 1, 2012. All shared systems shall ensure that
the new logic addresses all of the following scenarios: repairing any
errored old format claims in the current claim format; converting claims
held in suspense from an old format to the current claim format;

converting previously adjudicated old format claims to the current
"skinny" non-SFR COB claim format in adjustment claim situations; and
converting claims held in "provider alert status" from an earlier)
format to the current "skinny' non-SFR COB claim format.

For claims repair scenarios involving claims previously sent to the
*BCRC* in the prior format just prior to January 1, 2012, the shared
systems shall retransmit repaired claims to the *BCRC* in the current
format. To that end, all shared systems shall utilize CMS-issued mapping
and gap-filling guidance provided in chapter 24 §40.4 and chapter 28
§70.6.5 of Pub.100-04 when repairing their originally transmitted prior
format errored crossover claims in the HIPAA current ASC X12 837 claim
format on and after January 1, 2012. In addition, the shared systems
shall apply current non-SFR "skinny" logic to claim repair situations
where they originally transmitted claims to the *BCRC* prior to January
1, 2012 in the prior claim format.

**IMPORTANT:** A/B MACs and DME MACs shall **[not]{.underline}** repair
errored claims in a prior format that they transmitted to the *BCRC*
just prior to January 1, 2012 if the errors returned via the *BCRC*
Detailed Error Report relate to a field or segment that no longer exists
in the current claim format. Instead, A/B MACs and DME MACs shall issue
provider notification letters for those errored claims to the affected
providers.

**70.6.3 - Coordination of Benefits Agreement (COBA) Eligibility File
Claims Recovery Process**\
**(Rev. 10638; Issued: 03-09-21; Effective: 04-05-21; Implementation:
04-05-21)**

Effective January 2, 2007, when the CMS or the BCRC determines that 1)
certain members on a COBA production trading partner's eligibility file
were **not** properly loaded to the Common Working File (CWF)
Beneficiary Other Insurance (BOI) auxiliary file (see §70.6 of this
chapter for more details regarding this file) **or** 2) a COBA
production trading partner's claims selections, as conveyed via the COBA
Insurance File (COIF), were **not** properly loaded to the CWF, the CMS
shall send the A/B MAC crossover contact(s) and associated Virtual Data
Center (VDC) a 'COBAProcess' e-mail communication. When the CMS sends a
"COBAProcess" e-mail communication to an A/B MAC to initiate a COBA
eligibility file claims recovery process, the A/ B MAC shall acknowledge
receipt of the communication via return e-mail within 1 business day.
The CMS will then contact the A/B MAC's crossover staff and associated
VDC either via phone or e-mail to discuss the specific Common Working
File (CWF) date span (i.e., process date) or claim date of service
parameters, or both, for the claims recovery process. Additionally, CMS
will specify which specific MAC(s), by state, will be involved in the
COBA claims recovery activity*.***(NOTE:** DME MACs and their shared
system may be required to implement the COBA eligibility file claims
recovery process as part of a future instruction.)

Following the telephone discussion between the CMS and the A/B MAC
crossover staff, the COBA eligibility file recovery process will further
unfold as detailed below.

**1.** **Receipt and Processing of the BCRC COBA Eligibility File and
Searching Claims History for the** **Needed Claims**

*Until April 5, 2021, a*s part of an active COBA claims recovery, the
two VDCs that support the A/B MACs shall complete an Electronic
Transmittal Form *(See Attachment A at the conclusion of this section)*
on behalf of their associated MACs that are participating in a COBA
claims recovery process. (**[Note:]{.underline}** The COBA E01
eligibility file contains specifications on the COBA trading partner and
the individuals whose claims need to be recovered.)

*Effective April 5, 2021, the VDCs shall be prepared to accept the
following modified dataset names for the COBA E01 Eligibility File as
received from the CMS BDC:*

**Perspecta VDC Part A Recovery E01 Eligibility File:**
*ASH0.FISP.HBADR.GHI.FSSFCOBE(+1)*

**Perspecta VDC Part B Recovery E01 Eligibility File:**
*B999.MCSP.HBXDR.AR99RCVR(+1)*

**Companion Data Services (CDS) VDC Part A Recovery E01 Eligibility
File:** *ASP2.FISP.NDM.FSSFCOBE(+1)*

**CDS VDC Part B Recovery E01 Eligibility File:**
*B999.MCSP.HBXDR.AR99RCVR(+1)*

*Through the COBA claims recovery process,the COB&R system supporting
the BCRC* sends the appropriate VDC a copy of the trading partner's COBA
eligibility file(s), which will be prepared in accordance with the CMS
proprietary format. ([Note:]{.underline} *The COB&R system supporting
the BCRC* will transmit the COBA eligibility file to the VDC through its
existing Connect: Direct connection.) The VDC then notifies the affected
A/B MAC(s) that the COBA recovery eligibility file is available so that
the A/B MAC(s) may initiate a claims recovery.

Effective April 1, 2019, the shared systems supporting the A/B MACs
shall accept either a Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) or Medicare
Beneficiary Identifier (MBI), as reported via the COBA E01 eligibility
file, in the field defined as "Beneficiary Medicare ID" (file
displacement 64---75).

The A/B MAC shall initiate recovery of the processed claims by
systematically going against its online claims history that meet the
beneficiaries' eligibility dates, as provided on the BCRC eligibility
file(s), and that fall within the specified CWF date span (i.e., process
date) or date of service parameters, or both, that CMS has provided to
the A/B MAC.

In performing the COBA claims recovery, MACs shall not attempt to
recover claims that were previously transmitted to the BCRC.
\"Previously transmitted claims\" may be identified by the claims\'
crossover location status or the presence of the COBA ID being used for
the recovery process along with a \"P\" (production) indicator in
association with the processed claims.

Additionally, the MAC shall [not]{.underline} apply the COBA trading
partner\'s selection criteria, as found on the Health Insurance Master
Record (HIMR) COBS, when recovering claims.

**2.** **Time Frames for Recovery**

The A/B MAC shall complete its claims recovery process, culminating with
transmission of the recovered claims to the *COB&R system supporting*
the BCRC, within eight (8) work days following the date that it receives
the BCRC COBA eligibility file or as soon as possible thereafter as CMS
directs.

**3.** **Using Data Elements from the COBA Eligibility File For the
Claims Recovery Process and** **Copying Elements from That File to the
Recovered Claims Flat File**

A/ B MACs shall perform the following activities related to the COBA
eligibility file:

> a)Utilize each beneficiary's coverage dates from the COBA eligibility
> files (*file*\
> *displacement 121---128* for beneficiary supplemental eligibility-from
> date and *file displacement 129---136* for beneficiary supplemental-to
> date)*;* and successive eligibility-from and eligibility-to dates if
> provided);
>
> b)Apply the specified CWF date span; or
>
> c)Apply the date of service parameters; or
>
> d)Both items b and c above.

Once the A/B MAC, working with the VDC as necessary, has recovered the
specified claims, it shall copy the COBA ID from the BCRC COBA
eligibility file and place it within the NM109 segment of the 1000B loop
of the flat file containing the recovered Part A and B claims.

**4.** **Using Data Elements from the COBA Eligibility File For the
Claims Recovery Process and** **Copying Elements from That File to the
Recovered Claims Flat File**

A/ B MACs shall perform the following activities related to the COBA
eligibility file:

> e)Utilize each beneficiary's coverage dates from the COBA eligibility
> files (*file*\
> *displacement 121---128* for beneficiary supplemental eligibility-from
> date and *file displacement 129---136* for beneficiary supplemental-to
> date)*;* and successive eligibility-from and eligibility-to dates if
> provided);
>
> f)Apply the specified CWF date span; or
>
> g)Apply the date of service parameters; or
>
> h)Both items b and c above.

Once the A/B MAC, working with the VDC as necessary, has recovered the
specified claims, it shall copy the COBA ID from the BCRC COBA
eligibility file and place it within the NM109 segment of the 1000B loop
of the flat file containing the recovered Part A and B claims.

**4.** **Scope of the Claims Recovery Effort**\
Neither the A/B MAC nor its VDC shall be required to search archived
claims history while fulfilling the COBA eligibility file claims
recovery process.

The A/ B MAC and its VDC shall not be required to apply the COBA
production trading partner's selection criteria before transmitting the
recovered claims to the BCRC.

The A/B MAC or its VDC shall not transmit claims that had previously
been sent to the BCRCas part of the COBA eligibility file claims
recovery process, as demonstrated by the claims' crossover location
status or the presence of a COBA identification (ID) number accompanied
by a 'P' (production) indicator in relation to the processed claims.

**5**. **Populating a Unique BHT-03 Identifier to Designate Recovered
Claims**

The A/ B MAC shared systems shall be required to populate an 'R'
indicator in the 22nd position of the Beginning of the Hierarchical
Transaction (BHT)-03 segment of the ASC X12 837 flat file when
transmitting recovered claims for COBA production trading partners to
the BCRC. (**NOTE**: The CMS would only consider invoking the COBA
eligibility file recovery process for trading partners that are in
production mode. Therefore, this practice does not conflict with
previous guidance issued by the CMS, which may be referenced in §70.6.1
of this chapter.)

**6.** **Preparation and Transmission Requirements**

The recovered claim files shall be prepared in the same ASC X12 837 flat
file format used for normal, daily transmissions to the *COB&R system in
support of BCRC*, as discussed in §70.6 of this chapter.

*Effective April 5, 2021, in transmitting* the recovered claims to the
*CMS BDC (which, in turn, transmits the files to the COB&R system in
support of the* BCRC), *the VDCs shall transmit the claims* via a
separate ASC X12 837 flat file transmission using the *modified EFT*
dataset names *shown below.*

> **•***P/T#EFT.ON.COBA.PA.Cxxxxx.RCV.Dyymmdd.Thhmmsst \[For 837
> Institutional Claims\]*
>
> **•***P/T#EFT.ON.COBA.PB.Cxxxxx.RCV.Dyymmdd.Thhmmsst \[For 837
> non-DMEPOS Professional*
>
> *Claims\]*

*Note the following definitions apply to the dataset names above:*

> **•***P/T -- "P" = Production; "T"=Test*\
> **•***Cxxxxx = C + the 5-digit MAC ID; e.g, C12302*\
> **•***Dyymmdd.Thhmmsst = Current date and Time concatenated to
> literals D and T.*

The VDCs shall send no more than 100,000 recovered claims (which equates
to 20 ST-SE envelopes per A/B MAC with 5,000 claims per envelope) to the
*COB&R system supporting the* BCRC per transmission.

**7. Marking Claims History To Assist Customer Service Efforts**

When the VDC transmits the recovered claims to the *COB&R system
supporting the* BCRC, the A/B MAC shall mark its claims history to
indicate that each claim was recovered and transmitted to the BCRC to be
crossed over to the COBA trading partner.

A/B MACs shall notify their customer service representatives that they
will be able to determine that recovered claims were sent to the BCRC by
referencing claims history.

**8. BCRC Detailed Error Report Processes In Relation to the Claims
Recovery Process**

If A/B MACs receive BCRC Detailed Error Reports that contain a 22-byte
BHT-03 identifier that ends with an 'R,' they shall suppress generation
of provider letters, regardless of the error source code indicated
('111,' '222,' or '333').

When the A/B MAC, or its shared system, receives BCRC Detailed Error
Reports for recovered BCRC Detailed Error Reports for recovered claims
that contain '111,' '222,' or '333' errors, it shall mark its claims
history to indicate that the recovered claims will not be crossed over.

**9.** **The Possibility of Repairing COBA Recovery Claims**

A/B MACs, and their shared systems, shall assume that recovered claims
for COBA production trading partners that exceed established percentage
parameters for '111,' '222,' and '333' errors are potential candidates
for the COBA repair process, as provided in §70.6.2 of this chapter.

In accordance with the full claim file repair process discussed in
70.6.2 of this chapter, A/B MACs and their shared systems shall populate
an '18' Beginning of the Hierarchical Transmission (BHT)-02 transaction
set purpose code at the ST-SE envelope level when transmitting the
'repaired' COBA recovery claims.

Unlike the process documented in §70.6.2 of this chapter, A/B MACs shall
transmit 'repaired' COBA recovery claims to the *COB&R system supporting
the* BCRC via the separate ASC X12 837 flat file transmission for
recovery claims, as described within \"Preparation and Transmission
Requirements" above.

In addition, unlike the existing full claim file recovery process
documented in §70.6. 2 of this chapter, A/B MACs and their shared
systems shall include an 'R' in the 22nd position of the BHT-03
identifier when transmitting the 'repaired' COBA recovery claims to the
*COB&R system supporting the* BCRC.

A/B MACs, or their shared systems, shall also **not** generate provider
notification letters if they, in conjunction with CMS, determine that
the recovered claims that contained severe errors cannot be repaired.

**10. COBA Claims Recovery Financial Management Processes**

The CMS will reimburse the A/B MAC for individual claims accepted by the
trading partner at the current per claim rate.

The A/B MACs' shared systems shall develop a separate report for their
associated A/B MACs to enable them to fulfill the foregoing
requirements. The shared systems shall create reports that will provide
MACs with the count of recovered claims per cycle.

>
> **Scenario 1:** During the transitional period, if a provider,
> physician/practitioner, or supplier submits an ASC X12 837 current
> version institutional or professional claim to an A/B MAC (A), A/B MAC
> (HH), or DME MAC and if that entity receives a CWF BOI reply trailer

>
> **SPECIAL ONGOING RULE FOR ADJUSTMENT CLAIMS, CLAIMS HELD IN SUSPENSE,
> AND CLAIMS TO BE REPAIRED**
>
> The shared system shall produce a future version "skinny" claim,
> without SFR content, in the event that a claim that an A/B MAC or DME
> MAC originally adjudicated in the current version format is later
> released from suspense status or is adjusted during a time frame when
> a COBA trading partner has moved to the ASC X12 837 future version
> production (that is, the BOI reply trailer 29 contains a "P" future
> version Test/Production indicator).
>
> In addition, as of the mandatory cutover date to the future version
> claim transaction, all shared systems shall have the capability of
> repairing claims that previously errored out in the current version
> format prior to the cutover date, doing so in the future version COB
> claim format on and after January 1, 2012.
>
> **ADDRESSING INCOMING PAPER CLAIMS FOR OUTBOUND COB PURPOSES**
>
> **Scenario 1:** During the transitional period, if a provider,
> physician/practitioner, or supplier submits a hard-copy claim (paper
> Form CMS-1450 or Form CMS-1500) or, as applicable, enters a
> direct-data-entry (DDE) claim to an A/B MAC (A), A/B MAC (HH), or DME
> MAC and if that entity receives a CWF BOI reply trailer (29) that
> contains a "P" current version Test/Production indicator and a "T"
> future version indicator, the affected shared system shall: 1) produce
> a "skinny" non-SFR current version "production" COB claim; and 2)
> produce a "skinny" non-SFR future version "test" COB claim.
>
> **Scenario 2:** If a provider, physician/practitioner, or supplier
> submits a hard-copy claim (paper Form CMS-1450 or Form CMS-1500) or,
> as applicable, enters a DDE claim to an A/B MAC (A), A/B MAC (HH), or
> DME MAC and if that entity receives a CWF BOI reply trailer (29) that
> contains a "P" current version Test/Production indicator and an "N"
> future version indicator, the affected shared system shall: 1) produce
> a "skinny" non-SFR current version "production" COB claim; and 2)
> produce nothing in terms of a future version COB claim.
>
> **Scenario 3:** If a provider, physician/practitioner, or supplier
> submits a hard-copy claim (paper Form CMS-1450 or Form CMS-1500) or,
> as applicable, enters a DDE claim to an A/B MAC (A), A/B MAC (HH), or
> DME MAC and if that entity receives a CWF BOI reply trailer (29) that
> contains an "N" current version Test/Production indicator and a "T"
> future version indicator, the affected shared system shall: 1) produce
> nothing in terms of a current version claim; and 2) produce a "skinny'
> non-SFR future version "test" COB claim.
>
> **Scenario 4:** Finally, if a provider, physician/practitioner, or
> supplier submits a hard-copy claim (paper Form CMS-1450 or Form
> CMS-1500) or, as applicable, enters a DDE claim to an A/B MAC (A), A/B
> MAC (HH), or DME MAC and if that entity a CWF BOI reply trailer (29)
> that contains an "N" current version Test/Production indicator and a
> "P" future version indicator, the affected shared system shall: 1)
> produce nothing in terms of a current version COB claim; and 2)
> produce a "skinny" non-SFR future version\
> "production" COB claim.
>
> **IMPORTANT:** For all scenarios, if the inbound claim's format is the
> same as the outbound claim, the shared system shall produce crossover
> claims with full SFR claim content as part of their A/B MACs (A,B,
> HH)' or DME MACs' ASC X12 837 COB flat file transmissions to the BCRC.
>
> **II.** **General ASC X12 837 COB Flat File Mapping Requirements
> (Effective July 2012)**
>
> **A.** **ASC X12 837 Institutional COB Claim Mapping Rules**
>
> Effective with the testing and implementation of the HIPAA ASC X12 837
> institutional claim (new and now current version), the Fiscal
> Intermediary Shared System (FISS) shall observe the following business
> rules for mapping of the ASC X12 837 COB\
> (institutional) flat file:
>
> 1\. The following segments shall **[not]{.underline}** be passed to
> the BCRC:
>
> a\. ISA (Interchange Control Header Segment); b. IEA (Interchange
> Control Trailer Segment); c. GS (Functional Group Header Segment); and
> d. GE (Functional Group Trailer Segment).
>
> 2\. The shared system shall map the claim version (version
> 005010X223A2 upon adoption of the 5010 Errata changes) in the field of
> the ASC X12 837 5010 COB flat file that corresponds to the ST03

> a\. Normal claims submission to the BCRC---use "00"; and b. COBA
> claims repair process---use "18."
>
> 4\. The BHT03 (Beginning of the Hierarchical Transaction---Reference
> Identification or Originator Application Transaction ID) shall contain
> identifiers populated as follows:
>
> **a. 23 bytes for non-COBA recovery claims as follows:**
>
> Bytes 1-9---A/B MAC (A or HH) ID (9 bytes; A/B MAC (A or HH) ID, or, 5

> b.PER02---populate "BCRC EDI Department"; c.PER03---populate "TE";
> and\
> d.PER04---populate "6464586740."
>
> 6\. The 1000-B loop NM1 (Receiver Name) denotes the crossover trading
> partner. If an A/B MAC (A, HHH) on FISS receives multiple COBA IDs via
> the BOI reply trailer (29), the shared system shall submit a separate
> 837 transaction for each COBA ID received. Since crossover trading
> partner information will be unknown to the shared systems, the shared
> systems shall format the following fields as indicated:
>
> a.NM101---populate "40";\
> b.NM102---populate "2";\
> c.NM103---populate spaces (the BCRC will complete);\
> d.NM108---populate "46"; and\

>
> For 2010AA N3 and N4 segments, FISS shall derive the required segments
> from the A/B MAC (A or HH)'s internal provider file.
>
> 7b. If the incoming claim is paper Form CMS-1450 or direct data entry
> (DDE), which is treated as paper, FISS shall complete the 2010AA NM1
> (Billing Provider Name segments as follows:
>
> a\. NM101---populate "85";\
> b. NM102---populate "2";\
> c. NM103---derive from the A/B MAC (A or HH)'s internal provider
> file;\
> NM108---populate "XX"; and d.
>
> e.NM109---derive NPI from Form Locator (FL) 56 of the Form CMS-1450
> claim or applicable DDE field.
>
> For 2010AA N3 and N4 segments, FISS shall derive the required segments
> from FLs 1 and 2 of the Form CMS-1450 claim or internal provider file
> as necessary.
>
> 8a. To populate the 2010AB NM1 (Pay-to Address Name), FISS shall

>
> a\. NM101---populate "87";\
> b. NM102---populate "2"; and\
> c. NM103---derived from A/B MAC (A or HH)'s internal provider file.
>
> For 2010AB N3 and N4 segments, FISS shall derive the required segments
> from the A/B MAC (A or HH)'s internal provider file.
>
> 8b. If the incoming claim is paper Form CMS-1450 or direct data entry

>
> a\. NM101---populate "87";\
> b. NM102---populate "2"; and\
> c. NM103---derived from incoming claim.
>
> For 2010AB N3 and N4 segments, FISS shall derive the required segments
> from the A/B MAC (A or HH)'s internal provider file as necessary.
>
> 9\. FISS shall derive the 2010AA REF (Billing Provider-TAX ID)
> segments as follows, regardless of incoming claim's format:
>
> a\. For REF01---populate "EI"; and\
> b. For REF02---derive from A/B MAC (A or HH)'s internal provider file.
>
> 10a. For the 2000A and 2310-PRV in association with incoming
> electronic claims, FISS shall map the PRV01, PRV02, and PRV03 segments
> (which have already been validated for syntactical correctness at each
> affiliate A/B MAC (A or HH)'s front-end) to the equivalent 837 COB
> flat as follows:\
> a. For PRV01---populate "BI";\
> b. For PRV01---populate "PXC"; and\
> c. For PRV03---populate taxonomy code value from incoming claim.
>
> 10b. If the incoming claim is paper Form CMS-1450 or DDE entered, FISS
> shall only populate the 2000A-PRV (Bill-to Taxonomy) segments within
> the equivalent 837 COB flat fields as follows if the reported taxonomy
> code is syntactically correct:
>
> a.For PRV01---populate "BI";\
> b.For PRV01---populate "PXC"; and
>
> c\. For PRV03---populate taxonomy code as derived from the keying of
> FL 81cc(a) of the Form CMS-1450 claim form or as derived from the
> appropriate field from the online DDE screen.
>
> **NOTE:** The only reason why the 2310A PRV cannot be included on the
> 837 COB flat file is that the Form CMS-1450 claim and DDE claim entry
> screens can only accommodate Bill- to Provider taxonomy code
> reporting.
>
> 11\. FISS shall derive information for 2010AA PER 03, PER04, PER05,
> and PER06 if such information is present on the incoming electronic or
> paper claim or is available within the A/B MAC (A or HH)'s internal
> provider files.
>
> If the information is not available, or is available in incomplete
> form (i.e., fewer digits than required), the shared system shall
> [not]{.underline} create the 2010AA PER loop within the 837 new
> current version COB institutional flat file.
>
> 12a. For the 2320B SBR01, in situations where there is only one (1)
> payer that is primary to Medicare, FISS shall apply "P" to any payer
> that is primary before Medicare; "S" for Medicare as the secondary
> payer; and "U" for all\
> supplemental payers after Medicare.
>
> **SPECIAL NOTE:** If, for example, a claim contains at least two (2)
> primary payers before Medicare, FISS shall reflect the first payer as
> 2320 SBR01= "P"; the second as 2320 SBR01= "S"; and, the tertiary
> payer, Medicare, as 2320 SBR01="T." FISS shall reflect all additional\
> supplemental payers as SBR01= "U."
>
> 12b. For 2000B SBR01 (element 1138), FISS shall apply "P" when
> Medicare is the primary payer and shall apply "U" for all other
> supplemental payers after Medicare.
>
> 13\. For additional 2000B requirements, FISS shall take the following
> actions:
>
> a)SBR03---map spaces; and\
> b)SBR09---map "MC" if the COBA ID returned via the BOI reply trailer
> (29)=70000-79999; for all other COBA IDs, map "CI."
>
> 14\. The 2010BA loop denotes beneficiary subscriber information. FISS
> shall populate this loop and accompanying segments within the

> **V.** **DME MAC NCPDP New Version Cut-Over Requirements**
>
> The *BCRC* shall effectuate cut-over of COBA trading partners to the
> NCPDP new claim format through actions taken via the COIF.
>
> Upon receipt of a CWF BOI reply trailer (29) that contains a "P" NCPDP
> new version indicator [and]{.underline} an "N" current, in-use (or old
> version) NCPDP format indicator, VMS shall cease creation of NCPDP
> current, in-use (or old version) full COB claim [or]{.underline} NCPDP
> current, in use (or old version) non-SFR skinny COB claims as well as
> transmission of these files to the *BCRC*.
>
> **VI. Dual BCRC Detailed Error Reports During The Transitional Period
> and Accompanying New "222" Errors**
>
> During the NCPDP new version transitional period, all DME MACs shall
> accept and process two *BCRC* Detailed Error Reports---one generated
> by the *BCRC* for claims transmitted by the DME MACs in the current,
> in-use (or old) version NCPDP COB flat file format, and another
> generated by the *BCRC* for claims transmitted by the DME MACs in the

>
> The DME MAC shared system now accept "222" error conditions as part of
> the *BCRC* Detailed Error Report for NCPDP claims, as may be
> referenced in §70.6.1 of this chapter.
>
> In this vein, the DME MAC shared system shall not effectuate changes
> to expand the error description field portion of the *BCRC* NCPDP
> Detailed Error Report to accommodate receipt of the new "222" errors.
>
> Effective with July 2012, the *BCRC* will return the following new
> *"*222*"* errors to DME MACs via the *BCRC* NCPDP Detailed Error
> Reports:
>
> • N22230---NCPDP current, in use or old version "production" claim
> received, but the COBA trading partner is not accepting that version
> NCPDP "production" claims;
>
> • N22231---Current, in use or old version NCPDP "test" claim received,

> claims; and
>
> • N22233---NCPDP new version "test" claims received, but the COBA
> trading partner is not accepting new version NCPDP "test" claims.
>
> **IMPORTANT:** The BCRC shall [not]{.underline} begin applying "222"
> editing to incoming claims until 14 calendar days after a COBA trading
> partner's production cut-over to the NCPDP new version format have
> elapsed. The DME MACs shall [not]{.underline} attempt to repair claims

> N22230 through\
> N22233, regardless of error percentage.
>
> All DME MACs shall create special provider letters to their affiliate

> accordance with §70.6.1 of this chapter, for "production" claims with
> error codes N22230 or N22232.
>
> **VII. NCPDP New Version Claims Repair Processes**
>
> The DME MACs, working with their shared system, shall initiate new
> version NCPDP COB claims repair actions when: 1) the error percentage
> for "333" errors equals or exceeds four (4) percent; and 2) they
> receive even one (1) "111" error as noted on the BCRC Detailed Error
> Reports.
>
> As part of their process to initiate a claims repair, the DME MACs
> shall alert their shared system or Data Center, as per established
> protocol. The DME MACs shall also suppress generation of their
> provider notification letters, in accordance with §70.6.1 of this
> chapter, for up to 14 days.
>
> If the DME MACs determine that the timeframes for effectuating claim
> repairs for "111" or "333" errors fall outside of acceptable CMS
> parameters (e.g., will take 30-60 days or longer) [or]{.underline} if
> the volume of affected claims is low (1,000 claims or less per week),
> the DME MACs shall allow for the release of their special provider
> notification letters to affected suppliers. Any DME MACs that wish to
> effectuate a repair of NCPDP\
> "production" claims whose error percentage falls below four (4)
> percent shall contact a member of the CMS COBA team before attempting
> that action. As a rule, CMS will grant approval for such a repair if
> the volume of errored claims justifies that action and if the time
> frame for repair is acceptable.
>
> While DME MACs will not be expected to initiate the repair of "test"
> NCPDP claims, they shall continue to: 1) monitor the BCRC Detailed
> Error Reports; and 2) notify their shared systems of errors returned
> so that necessary shared system changes to improve HIPAA compliance
> rates may be realized.
>
> **IMPORTANT:** The DME MAC shared system shall apply NCPDP non-SFR
> "skinny" logic to claim repair situations where they originally
> transmitted claims to the BCRC prior to January 1, 2012, in the NCPDP
> prior version claim format.

>
> Although most States have some type of penalty provisions regarding
> fraud and\
> misrepresentation in the sale of health insurance policies, Congress
> considered that many State laws either did not directly address the
> following types of abuses, or else the sanctions generally available
> under State laws were considered too limited. Therefore, in order to

> to provide stiff penalties (fines up to \$25,000 and/or imprisonment
> for up to five years) these provisions were included in Section 507 of
> P.L. 96-265.
>
> **A. Section** - This paragraph prohibits the making of a false
> representation with regard to the compliance of a policy with the
> Federal requirements contained in this law. Additionally, it prohibits
> the making of any false statement or misrepresentation
>
> with respect to the use of the emblem that signifies the Secretary's

> Policies submitted under this Voluntary Certification Program were
> accepted for review by the Medigap Operations Staff beginning January

> received the Secretary's certification, or that its policy has
> received or is eligible for the Secretary's emblem, when, in fact, it
> has not received such certification or emblem, can be prosecuted under
> this paragraph. This paragraph became effective June 9, 1980.
>
> **B. Section** - This paragraph prohibits the false representation of
> an\
> association or agency relationship with the Medicare program or any
> Federal agency for the purpose of selling insurance. Of the complaints
> received by CMS, the majority involves alleged violations of this
> paragraph. These complaints indicate that agents gained entry and, in
> some cases, sold policies by misrepresenting, either by direct
> statement or by implication, that they were associated with Medicare,
> CMS, or the Social Security Administration. This paragraph became
> effective June 9, 1980.
>
> **C. Section** - This paragraph provides penalties for knowingly
> selling duplicative coverage (sometimes referred to as "stacking" or
> "loading)." This occurs when an agent sells insurance to an individual
> knowing that it duplicates coverage that he/she already has without
> duplicating benefits. This paragraph became effective June 9, 1980.
>
> Although many States have statutes that specifically prohibit

> (misrepresentations made by an agent for the purpose of inducing the

> health insurance policies by mail into a State if these policies have
> not been approved by the Commissioner of Insurance for sale within the

>
> Representatives of CMS, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and
> the Department of Justice (DOJ) have consulted to develop a
> coordinated procedure for the screening, investigation, and
> prosecution of cases arising under these penalty provisions.
>
> The Fraud Section, DOJ, has expressed great interest in the

> U.S. Attorneys addressing the existence and
>
> importance of the Medigap law and alerting them to the probability of
> referrals of cases developed jointly by CMS, OIG, and by State
> Insurance Departments.
>
> **A. CMS/OIG Agreement**
>
> The CMS and OIG have reached the following agreement as to the
> division of functional responsibilities with regard to the screening
> and investigation of alleged violations of §1882(d):
>
> 1.CMS, through its regional offices, is responsible for the
> preliminary screening of complaints and for providing information
> regarding the complaints to the appropriate State Insurance
> Department.
>
> 2.The OIG is responsible for the investigation of cases referred by
> the CMS RO and for coordinating investigatory activities with the
> State Insurance\
> Departments if requested and warranted. Further, OIG will provide any
> necessary liaison between State Insurance Departments and the U.S.\
> Attorneys.
>
> **B. CMS RO Responsibilities**
>
> Upon receipt of a complaint, the RO sends an informational copy of the
> complaint and any supporting documentation to the Regional Office of
> the Inspector General. The Special Agents in Charge will serve as the
> OIG contact point for CMS referrals.
>
> Additionally, the RO sends a copy of the original complaint and any
> supporting\
> documentation to the appropriate State Insurance Department. This is
> to be accompanied by a request for information as to the status of any
> State investigation regarding the same agent or company or the
> specific case in question.
>
> 1.If the State indicates that it is currently investigating, or
> intends to investigate the agent or company, the RO provides any
> information which may be helpful to the State and advise the State of
> the existence of the Federal penalty provisions and the availability
> of investigatory advice and/or assistance from the Regional Office of
> the Inspector General.
>
> If the facts also indicate that a Federal violation may exist, the RO
> should keep the file open and request that the State advise them as to
> the status and, eventually, the disposition of the case.
>
> If the facts indicate a possible State violation but no Federal
> violation, the RO out the case after referring it to the appropriate
> State Insurance Department.
>
> In either event, the RO should respond to the complainant that the
> case has been referred to the State Insurance Department for
> investigation. The RO sends a copy
>
> of this response to the State, Regional OIG, and to the Medigap
> Operations Staff (MOS).
>
> 2.Where the State indicates that it does not plan to take action on
> the case, or where no response is received from the State within a
> reasonable period of time, i.e., not more than 30 days, the RO should
> proceed to screen the case. This activity consists of:
>
> ● Verifying the facts alleged in the complaint; and
>
> ● Determining whether the facts appear to constitute prohibited
> activity.
>
> 3.Where preliminary screening indicates that a mistake of fact exists,
> or that the facts do not indicate a Federal violation, the RO should
> respond to the\
> complainant and attempt to clarify the misunderstanding. The RO sends
> a copy of the RO response to the complainant to MOS, the Special Agent
> in Charge, and the appropriate State Insurance Department.
>
> **Verification of Facts -** The A/B MAC (A, B, HH) or DME MAC logs in
> complaints as they are received and establishes appropriate procedures
> to ensure that follow-up action is taken on any request for additional
> information. Verification of facts may include interviewing the
> complainant (either by phone or in person, as appropriate) to:
>
> ● Determine whether the facts, as originally reported, are accurate
> and precise;
>
> ● Clarify statements that are confusing or contradictory as originally
> recorded.
>
> ● Secure any missing or additional information; and
>
> ● Determine whether any similar complaints or additional information
> may be derived from others (e.g., relatives or neighbors).
>
> In interviewing the complainant and others, keep in mind the
> substantive facts that may lead to prosecution. The MAC uses the
> suggested format for referral to the Regional OIG as a checklist for
> the interview. As far as possible, the RO should keep the complainant
> informed of the status of the action taken on the complaint. So as to
> maintain a high level of cooperation; inform the complainant when he
> can expect to be contacted again, who will contact him, etc.
>
> It is important that the RO **not** directly contact either the agent
> or the insurance company involved since this falls within the purview
> of investigation and is the function of the OIG.
>
> **Referral to the Regional Office of the Inspector General -** When
> the preliminary screening process reveals an indication that the
> Federal law has been violated, refer the case to the Regional OIG for
> additional development. The OIG performs the necessary
>
> investigation and coordinates with the appropriate U.S. Attorney for
> prosecution. At this point, CMS will cooperate with any request by the
> U.S. Attorney, State Insurance Department, and OIG to promote timely
> and successful prosecution.
