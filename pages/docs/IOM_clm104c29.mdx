***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:
10- 01-19)***\
**Adjudicator** -- The entity responsible for making the decision at any
level of the Medicare claim decision making process, from initial
determination to the final level of appeal, on a specific claim.

**Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)** -- Adjudicator employed by the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Medicare
Hearings and Appeals (OMHA) that holds hearings and issues decisions
related to level 3 of the appeals process.

**Affirmation** - A term used to denote that a prior claims
determination has been upheld by the current claims adjudicator.
Although appeals through the OMHA level are de novo, CMS and its
contractors often use this term when an adjudicator reaches the same
conclusion as that in the prior determination, even though he/she is not
bound by the prior determination.

**Amount in Controversy** (AIC) - The dollar amount required to be in
dispute to establish the right to a particular level of appeal. Congress
establishes the amount in controversy requirements.

**Appeals Council** -- The Medicare Appeals Council (herein Appeals
Council), a division within the Departmental Appeals Board, provides the
final level of administrative review of claims for entitlement to
Medicare and individual claims for Medicare coverage and payment. (See
also Departmental Appeals Board.)\
**Appellant** - The term used to designate the party (i.e., the
beneficiary, provider, supplier, or other person showing an interest in
the claim determination) or the representative of the party that has
filed an appeal.

The adjudicator determines if a particular appellant is a proper party
or representative of a proper party. **Applicable plan** -- Applicable
plan means liability insurance (including self-insurance), no-fault
insurance, or a workers\' compensation law or plan.

**Appointed representative** -- The individual appointed by a party to
represent the party in a Medicare claim or claim appeal.

**Assignee** -- (1) With respect to the assignment of a claim for items
or services, the assignee is the supplier who has furnished items or
services to a beneficiary and has accepted a valid assignment of a
claim; OR\
(2) With respect to an assignment of appeal rights, an assignee is a
provider or supplier who is not already a party to an appeal, who has
furnished items or services to a beneficiary, and has accepted a valid
assignment of the right to appeal a claim executed by the beneficiary.

**Assignment of appeal rights** -- The transfer by a beneficiary of his
or her right to appeal under the claims appeal process to a provider or
supplier who is not already a party, and who provided the items or
services to the beneficiary.

**Assignor** -- A beneficiary whose provider of service or supplier has
taken assignment of a claim, or assignment of an appeal of a claim.

***Attorney Adjudicator -***A licensed attorney employed by OMHA with
knowledge of Medicare coverage and payment laws and guidance, authorized
to take the actions provided for in 42 CFR 405 subpart I on requests for
ALJ hearing and requests for reviews of QIC dismissals.

**Authorized representative** -- An individual authorized under State or
other applicable law to act on behalf of a beneficiary or other party
involved in the appeal. The authorized representative will have all of
the rights and responsibilities of a beneficiary or party, as
applicable, throughout the appeals process.

**Beneficiary** -- Individual who is enrolled to receive benefits under
Medicare Part A and/or Part B.

**Contractor -** An entity that contracts with the Federal government to
review and/or adjudicate claims, determinations and/or decisions.

**Date of Receipt --** A determination, decision or notice is presumed
to have been received by the party five days from the date included on
the determination or decision, unless there is evidence to the contrary.

**NOTE:** Throughout Chapter 29, reference to day or days means calendar
days unless otherwise specified.

**Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) Review** - The DAB provides
impartial, independent review of disputed decisions in a wide range of
Department of Health and Human Services programs under more than 60
statutory provisions. The Medicare Appeals Council (herein Appeals
Council), a division within the Departmental Appeals Board, provides the
final level of administrative review of claims for entitlement to
Medicare and individual claims for Medicare coverage and payment. (See
section 340 in this chapter.)

**De Novo** - Latin phrase meaning "anew" or "afresh," used to denote
the manner in which claims are adjudicated in the administrative appeals
process. Adjudicators at each level of appeal make a new, independent
and thorough evaluation of the claim(s) at issue, and are not bound by
the findings and decision made by an adjudicator in a prior
determination or decision.

**Decisions and Determinations** -If a Medicare appeal request does not
result in a dismissal, adjudication of the appeal results in either a
"determination" or "decision." There is no apparent practical
distinction between these two terms although applicable regulations use
the terms in distinct contexts.

A decision that is reopened and thereafter revised is called a "revised
determination."

**Dismissal** - An action taken by an adjudicator when an appeal will
not be conducted as requested. A request for appeal may be dismissed for
any number of reasons, including:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| > 1.\                             | > Abandonment of the appeal by    |

+===================================+===================================+
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

**Limitation on Liability Determination**- Section of the Social
Security Act (the Act) provides financial relief to beneficiaries,
providers and sup by permitting Medicare payment to be made, or
requiring refunds to be made, for certain services and items for which
Medicare coverage and payment would otherwise be denied. This section of
the Act is referred to as "the limitation on liability provision." Both
the underlying coverage determination and the limitation on liability
determination may be challenged. For more detailed information see
chapter 30 of this manual.

***Medicare number and/orMedicare beneficiary identifier (Mbi)***- are
general terms describing a beneficiary's Medicare identification number.
Medicare beneficiary identifier references both the Health Insurance
Claim Number (HICN) and the Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) during
the new Medicare card transition period and after for certain business
areas that will continue to use the HICN as part of their processes. For
the beneficiary population, the term Medicare number is used to describe
the Medicare beneficiary identifier (Mbi).

**Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals (OMHA) -** The Office of
Medicare Hearings and Appeals is responsible for level 3 of the Medicare
claims appeal process and certain Medicare entitlement appeals and Part
B premium appeals. At level 3 of the appeals process, an appellant may
have a hearing before an OMHA ALJ, or review by an attorney adjudicator.

**Party** - A person and/or entity normally understood to have standing
to appeal an initial determination and/or a subsequent administrative
appeal determination or decision. (See section 210 in this chapter.)

**Provider of services (herein provider)** -- As used in this section,
the definition in for provider applies. Provider means a hospital, a
critical access hospital (CAH), a skity, a comprehensive outpatient
rehabilitation facility, a home health agency, or a hospice that has in
effect an agreement to participate in Medicare, or a clinic, a
rehabilitation agency, or a public health agency that has in effect a
similar agreement but only to furnish outpatient physical therapy or
speech pathology services, or a community mental health center that has
in effect a similar agreement but only to furnish partial
hospitalization services. NOTE: A non-participating provider, that is,
an entity eligible to enter into a provider agreement to participate in
Medicare but has not entered into such an agreement, is not considered a
provider of services and does not have party status for an initial
determination or appeal.

**Qualified Independent Contractor (QIC)** -- Entity that contracts with
the Secretary in accordance with the Act to perform level 2 appeals,
which are called reconsiderations, and expedited reconsiderations.

**Remand** -- An action taken by an adjudicator to vacate a lower level
appeal decision, or a portion of the decision, and return the case, or a
portion of the case, to that level for a new decision.

**Reopening -** See IOM 100-04 Chapter 34.

**Reversal** - Although appeals in the administrative appeals processare
de novo proceedings (i.e., a new determination/decision is made at each
level), Medicare uses this term where the new determination/decision is
more favorable to the appellant than the prior determination/decision,
even if some aspects of the prior determination/decision remain the
same.

**NOTE:** The term reversal describes the coverage determination, not
the liability determination. For example, an itay be determined to be
non-covered as not medically reasonable and necessary (under section of
the Act), but Medicare may, nevertheless, make payment for the item or e
if the pt financially liable after applying the limitation on liability
provision (section of the Act). Thus, the coverage determination is
affirmed, but Medicare makes payment as required by .

**Revised Determination or Decision** - An initial determination or
decision that is reopened and which results in the issuance of a revised
determination or decision. A revised determination or decision is
considered a separate and distinct determination or decision and may be
appealed. For example, a post-payment review of an initial determination
that results in a reversal of a previously covered/paid claim (and,
potentially, a subsequent overpayment determination) constitutes a
reopening and a revised initial determination. The first level of appeal
following a revised initial determini

**Spo**word "spouse" as used in this chapter, and as used in sections
and of title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
regardinmaincl-sex spouses as well as opposite-sex spouses. The
relationship of two individuals of the same sex will be recognized as a
marriage if either (1) the state or territory in which the individuals
live\
recognizes their relationship as a marriage, or (2) the individuals
entered into a legally valid marriage under the law of any state,
territory, or foreign jurisdiction. Because civil unions and domestic
partnerships are not marriages, civil union and domestic partners are
not regarded as spouses by CMS.

**Supplier** --Unless the context otherwise requires, a physician or
other practitioner, a facility, or entity (other than a provider of
services) that furnishes items or services under Medicare.

**Vacate** -- To set aside a previous action.

**A.Entitlement Determinations**

In accordance with a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary, the
Social Security Administration (SSA) makes initial Part A and Part B
entitlement determinations and initial determinations on applications
for entitlement. Individuals should contact the SSA for administrative
appeals involving entitlement 1-800-325-0778 or access the SSA's website
at:\
.This would include issues that involve the question of whether the

>
> • Met the deemed insured provisions; and

> insurance (HI) obtained by premium payment.

If a beneficiary is dissatisfied with the SSA's initial determination on
entitlement, he or she may request a recohe SSA performs a
reconsideration of its initial determination in accordance with
Following the reconsideration, the beneficiary may request a hearing
befo[w]{.underline} Judge (ALJ). If the beneficiary obtains a hearing
before an ALJ and is dissatisfied with the decision of the ALJ, he or
she may request the Appeals Council to review the case.

Following the action of the Appeals Council, the beneficiary may be
entitled to file suit in Federal district court.

**B. Initial Determinations**

The Medicare contractor makes initial determinations regarding claims
for benefits under Medicare Part A and Part B. A finding that a request
for payment does not meet the requirements for a Medicare claim shall
not be considered an initial determination. An initial determination for
purposes of this chapter includes, but is not limited to, determinations
with respect to:

> \(1\) Whether the items and/or services furnished are covered under
> title XVIII of the Act;
>
> \(2\) In the case of determinations on the basis of section e Act,

**C. Actions That Are Not Initial Determinations**

Actions that are not initial determinations and are not appealable under
this chapter include, but are not limited to---

> (1)Any determination for which CMS has sole responsibility, for
> example: whether an entity meets the conditions for participation in
> the program; whether an independent laboratory meets the conditions

**NOTE:** For example, section of the Act prohibits administrative and
judicial review of the individual components used tMedicare physician
fee schedule payment amounts. However, a payment amount determination
with respect to a particular item or service on a claim is an initial
determination that is appealable.

> or do not meet the requirements of a Medicare claim and returned or
> rejected to the provider or supplier.

**NOTE:** Duplicate items and services are not afforded appeal rights,
unless the supplier is appealing whether or not the service was, in
fact, a duplicate.

**D. Initial Determinations Subject to Reopening**

Minor errors or omissions in an initial determination may be corrected
only through the contractor's reopening process. Since it is neither
cost efficient or necessary for contractors to correct clerical errors
through the appeals process, requests for adjustments to claims
resulting from clerical errors must be handled and processed as
reopenings. In situations where a provider, supplier, or beneficiary
requests an appeal and the issue involves a minor error or omission,
irrespective of the request for an appeal, contractors shall treat the
request as a request for reopening. A contractor must transfer the
appeal request to the reopenings unit or other designated unit for
processing. See Chapter 34 Section 10.1 Authority to Conduct a Reopening
of the Medicare Claims Processing Manual for information specific to
conducting a reopening when a redetermination was requested.

**210 - Who May Appeal**\
***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:
10- 01-19)***

Parties to the redetermination and subsequent appeal levels include:

> • The parties to the initial determination, above*;*

**NOTE:** In addition to his/her own right to appeal Medicare's decision
regarding an initial determination, a beneficiary is a party to any
request for redetermination filed by a provider or supplier. The
beneficiary is always a party to an appeal of services rendered on their
behalf, at any level (except when the beneficiary has assigned his/her
appeal rights to a provider or supplier).

Neither the contractor nor CMS is considered a party to an appeal at the
redetermination or reconsideration levels, and therefore does not have
the right to appeal or to participate as a party at this stage in the
administrative appeals process. CMS or a contractor may choose to
participate in an ALJ hearing, become a party to an ALJ hearing (with
CMS' approval), or may recommend that the Administrative QIC (AdQIC)
refer an ALJ decision or dismissal to the Appeals Council for review
under its own motion review authority.

At times, an ALJ may ask for a contractor's or QIC's input to a hearing.
This does not change the contractor's party status.

**NOTE:** While a representative may request an appeal on behalf of the
party that he/sherepresents, the representative is not a party to the
appeal solely by virtue of being a representative. (See §270 for the
rights

and responsibilities of a representative.) The provider of the item or
service denied may represent the individual, but may not impose any
financial liability on the individual in connection with such\
representation. If limitation on liability is involved, the provider of
the item or service may represent the individual only if the provider
waives any rights for payment from the individual with respect to the
services or items involved in the appeal.

**210.1 - Provider or Supplier Appeals When the Beneficiary is Deceased
(Rev. 695, Issued: 10-07-05; Effective: 05-01-05; Implementation:
01-09-06)**

When a provider or supplier appeals on behalf of a deceased beneficiary
and the provider or supplier otherwise does not have the right to
appeal, the MAC must determine whether another party is available to
appeal by taking either of the following actions:

• The MAC may send a letter to the last known address of the
beneficiary, or to the beneficiary\'s estate, if known. The letter
should advise the beneficiary\'s estate (or anyone taking responsibility
for the deceased\'s bills for medical or other health services) of the
right to appeal the claim denial. The letter also should provide
information that the provider or supplier wishes to appeal. The letter
should provide the beneficiary\'s estate with the following three
options:

> oOption 1: I wish to appeal this claim.

oOption 2: I am not available to appeal, please process the provider\'s
appeal and let me know of the result.

> oOption 3: I am available to appeal, but do not wish to exercise my
> right to appeal.

The MAC should allow the estate at least 10 days to respond, or the
remainder of the time frame for requesting an appeal \-- whichever is
greater. If the estate does not respond in the allotted time frame, the
MAC should annotate the file that no other party is available to appeal
and continue to process the provider\'s or supplier\'s appeal. If the
estate responds that it is available and wishes to appeal, the MAC
should continue with the appeal and notify the provider or supplier of
the results. If the estate indicates that it is not available to appeal,
then the MAC should continue to process the appeal and notify the
beneficiary\'s estate of the decision. If the estate indicates that it
is available, but does not want to appeal, the MAC should dismiss the
provider or supplier\'s request on the basis that there is another party
available, even though the party does not intend to pursue the appeal;
or

The MAC may send a letter to the provider or supplier to request written
confirmation that they are not aware of any other party available to
appeal. The MAC should allow the provider or supplier 10 days to provide
confirmation. If the MAC does not receive written confirmation within 15
days, it should dismiss the appeal on the basis that the provider or
supplier did not confirm that there was no other party available to
appeal.

**220 - Steps in the Appeals Process: Overview**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

Regulations at provide that a party to a redetermination that is
dissatisfied with an initial determicontractor make a redetermination.
The request for redetermination must be filed within 120 days after the
date of receipt of the notice of the initial determination (the notice
of initial determination is presumed to be received 5 days after the
date of the notice unless there is evidence to the contrary).
Contractors cannot accept an appeal for which no initial determination
has been made. The parties specified in §210 who are dissatisfied with a
determination on their Part A or B claim have appeal rights.

The appeals process consists of five levels. The appellant must begin
the appeal at the first level after receiving an initial determination.
Each level, after the initial determination, has procedural steps the

appellant must take before appealing to the next level. Each level is
discussed in detail in subsequent sections. If the appellant meets the
procedural steps at a specific level (including the amount in
controversy (AIC) requirement if applicable), the appellant (and all
other parties to the appeal decision) is then afforded the right to
appeal any determination or decision to the next level in the process.
The appellant may exercise the right to appeal any determination or
decision to the next higher level, until appeal rights are exhausted.
Although there are five distinct levels in the Medicare appeals process,
the redetermination, level 1, is the only level in the appeals process
that the contractor performs.

When an appellant requests a reconsideration with a QIC (level 2), the
contractor must prepare and forward the case file to the QIC. Further,
the contractor may have effectuation responsibilities for decisions made
by the QIC. The contractor, however, does [not]{.underline} have
responsibility for reviewing the QIC's decision for accuracy. When an
appellant requests an [Ad]{.underline}ministrative Law Judge (ALJ)
hearing or review by an attorney adjudicator (level 3), the QIC must
prepare and forward the case file to the OMHA. Further, the contractor
may have effectuation responsibilities for decisions made at OMHA,
Departmental Appeals Board (DAB)/Appeals Council, and Federal Court
levels.

In the chart below, levels 1 -- 4 are part of the Administrative Appeals
Process. If an appellant has completed all the first 4 steps of the
administrative appeals process and is still dissatisfied, the appellant
may appeal to the Federal courts, provided the appellant satisfies the
requirements for obtaining judicial review.

**240 - Time Limits for Filing Appeals & Good Cause for Extension of the
Time Limit for Filing Appeals**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

**A. Time Limits for Each Level of Appeal**\
The time limits for filing appeals vary according to the type of appeal:

> • **Redetermination** - The time limit for filing a request for
> redetermination is 120 days from the date of receipt of the Medicare
> Summary Notice (MSN) or Remittance Advice (RA). See §240.1-240.5 for
> clarifications and exceptions to this rule.)
>
> • **QIC Reconsideration** - The time limit for filing a request for
> reconsideration is 180 days from the date of receipt of the notice of
> the redetermination. If a party requests QIC review of a MAC's
> dismissal of a request for redetermination, the time limit for filing
> is 60 days from the date of receipt of the MAC's dismissal notice.
>
> • **ALJ Hearing** - The time limit for filing a request for an ALJ
> hearing is 60 days from the date of receipt of the reconsideration
> notice.
>
> • **Appeals Council Review** - The time limit for filing a request for
> review by the Appeals Council is 60 days from the date of receipt of
> the ALJ's or attorney adjudicator's decision.
>
> • **Judicial Review** - The time limit for filing for judicial review
> is 60 days from the date of the Appeals Council\'s decision.

A request filed with the A/B MAC (A), (B), (HHH), or DME MAC is
considered to have been filed as of the date the MAC received it. The
MAC computes the time limit for requesting a redetermination by allowing
5 additional days beyond the time limit (120 days for a redetermination)
from the date of the previous notice. This allows a 5-day period for
mail delivery. The MAC allows for additional time if there is evidence
that the mail delivery was longer than 5 days.

**[NOTE:]{.underline}** When the beneficiary preference is to have all
documents converted into an accessible format, [MACs s]{.underline}hall
make allowances for additional delivery time of the accessible format.
The MAC shall also provide allowance for a delayed response as a result
of a beneficiary having sought and received help from an auxiliary
resource (such as a SHIP or senior center), on account of his or her
disability, in order to be able to file an appeal (also see §240.2).

When the filing deadline for a redetermination ends on a Saturday,
Sunday, legal holiday, or any other nonwork day, the MAC shall apply a
rollover period that extends the filing deadline to the first working
day

after the Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or other nonwork day. For
example, if the filing deadline for a redetermination falls on the
Saturday before Columbus Day, the filing deadline is extended to the
first working day after the Columbus Day holiday.

These time limits may be extended if good cause for late filing is
shown. (See §240.1-240.5.) When a redetermination request appears to be
filed late, the MAC makes a finding of good cause using the guidelines
in §240.2 through §240.4 before taking any other action on the appeal.

**B. Extension of Time Limit for Filing a Request for Redetermination**

The time limit for filing a request for redetermination may be extended
in certain situations. Generally, providers, physicians or other
suppliers are expected to file appeal requests on a timely basis. A
request from a provider, physician, or other supplier to extend the
period for filing the request for redetermination should not be
routinely granted and such requests warrant careful examination. For a
beneficiary request, more lenience should be given.

Upon request by the party that has missed the filing deadline, the A/B
MAC (A), (B), (HHH), or DME MAC may extend the period for filing the
request for redetermination. The procedures for finding good cause to
excuse late filing are discussed below.

**240.1 - Good Cause**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

If an appeal request is filed late, the applicable MAC may extend the
time limit for filing an appeal if good cause is shown. The MAC resolves
the issue of whether good cause exists before taking any other action on
the appeal. Whenever a MAC makes a finding for good cause for late
filing, the MAC shall document the reason for that finding in the
redetermination decision letter. If no decision letter is issued (i.e.,
a decision fully favorable to the appellant is made, which currently
does not require issuance of a redetermination decision letter), then
the reason the MAC found that good cause exists for late filing shall be
documented in the redetermination case file.

**NOTE:** A finding by the MAC that good cause exists for late filing
for the redetermination does not mean that the party is then excused
from the timely filing rules for the reconsideration.

**240.2 - Conditions and Examples That May Establish Good Cause for Late
Filing by Beneficiaries**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

**A. Conditions**

Good cause may be found when the record clearly shows, or the
beneficiary alleges, that the delay in filing was due to one of the
following:

> • Circumstances beyond the beneficiary's control, including mental or
> physical impairment (e.g., disability, extended illness) or
> significant communication difficulties;
>
> • Incorrect or incomplete information about the subject claim and/or
> appeal was furnished by official sources (CMS, the contractor, or the
> Social Security Administration) to the beneficiary (e.g., a party is
> not notified of her appeal rights or a party receives inaccurate
> information regarding a filing deadline);
>
> **NOTE**: Whenever a beneficiary is not notified of his/her appeal
> rights or of the time limits for filing, good cause must be found.
>
> • Delay resulting from efforts by the beneficiary to secure supporting
> evidence, where the beneficiary did not realize that the evidence
> could be submitted after filing the request;
>
> • When destruction of or other damage to the beneficiary's records was
> responsible for the delay in filing (e.g., a fire, natural disaster);
>
> • Unusual or unavoidable circumstances, the nature of which
> demonstrates that the beneficiary could not reasonably be expected to
> have been aware of the need to file timely;
>
> • Serious illness which prevented the party from contacting the
> contractor in person, in writing, or through a friend, relative, or
> other person;
>
> • A death or serious illness in his or her immediate family;
>
> • A request was sent to a Government agency in good faith within the
> time limit, and the request did not reach the appropriate contractor
> until after the time period to file a request expired; or
>
> •Delay due to additional time required to produce the beneficiary's
> Medicare documents (such as an MSN) in an accessible format (e.g.,
> large print, Braille, etc.);
>
> •Delay as the result of an individual having sought and received help
> from an auxiliary resource (such as a SHIP or senior center), due to
> his or her disability, in order to be able to file the appeal.

**B. Examples**

Following are examples of cases where good cause for late filing is
found. This list is illustrative only and not all-inclusive:

> • Beneficiary was hospitalized and extremely ill, causing a delay in
> filing;
>
> • Beneficiary is deceased. Her husband, as representative of the
> beneficiary's estate, died during the appeals filing period. Request
> was then filed late by the deceased husband's executor;
>
> • The denial notice sent to the beneficiary did not specify the time
> limit for filing for the redetermination; and
>
> • The request was received after, but close to, the last day to file,
> and the beneficiary claims that the request was submitted timely.
>
> **240.3 - Conditions and Examples That May Establish Good Cause for
> Late Filing by Providers, Physicians, or Other Suppliers**\
> **(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
> 06-13-19)**
>
> In general, A/B MACs (A), (B), (HHH), and DME MACs should not
> routinely find good cause when a provider, physician or other supplier
> submits an untimely appeal request. However, good cause may be found
> when the record clearly shows, or the provider, physician or other
> supplier alleges and the record does not negate, that the delay in
> filing was due to one of the following:
>
> • Incorrect or incomplete information about the subject claim and/or
> appeal was furnished by official sources (CMS, the MACs, or the Social
> Security Administration) to the provider, physician, or other
> supplier; or
>
> • Unavoidable circumstances that prevented the provider, physician, or
> other supplier from timely filing a request for redetermination.
> Unavoidable circumstances encompass situations that are
>
> beyond the provider, physician or supplier's control, such as major
> floods, fires, tornados, and other natural catastrophes.

**NOTE:** Failure of a billing company or other consultant (that the
provider, physician, or other supplier has retained) to timely submit
appeals or other information is NOT grounds for finding good cause for
late filing. The MAC does not find good cause where the provider,
physician, or other supplier claims that lack of business office
management skills or expertise caused the late filing.

**240.4 -- Good Cause - Administrative Relief Following a Disaster
*(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation: 10-
01-19)***

When a disaster occurs, whether natural or man-made, MACs shall
anticipate both an increased demand for emergency and other health care
services, and a corresponding disruption to normal health care delivery
systems and networks. For appeals purposes, as defined in this IOM, a
'disaster area' is declared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA). In disaster situations, MACs that process appeals for
beneficiaries, providers, and suppliers affected by a disaster shall
exercise good cause in accordance with the regulations and follow the
guidance below regarding how to process Fee-for-Service appeal requests
in an area(s) declared by FEMA as a disaster area.

When a Presidential declaration occurs, the HHS Secretary may, under
section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, declare that a Public
Health Emergency (PHE) exists in the affected State. Once a PHE is
declared, section 1135 of the Social Security Act authorizes the
Secretary, among other things, to temporarily modify or waive certain
Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and HIPAA requirements as determined necessary
by CMS.

**A.Definition of Disaster**

A disaster is defined as any natural or man-made catastrophe (such as
hurricane, tornado, earthquake, volcanic eruption, mudslide, snowstorm,
tsunami, terrorist attack, bombing, fire, flood, or explosion) which
causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to partially or
completely destroy medical records and associated documentation that
could be needed and/or requested by the MACs in the course of the
adjudication process, interrupts normal mail service (including US
Postal delivery, overnight parcel delivery services, etc.), impacts
ability to file appeals in a timely manner, and/or otherwise
significantly limit the provider's/supplier\'s daily operations.

A disaster may be widespread and impact multiple structures (e.g., a
regional flood) or isolated and impact a single site only (e.g., water
main failure). The fact that a provider/supplier is located in a
presidentially declared disaster area under the power of the Stafford
Act is not sufficient in itself to justify administrative relief, as not
all structures in the disaster area may have been subject to the same
amount of damage.

Damage must be of sufficient severity and extent to compromise retrieval
of medical records. The provider/supplier needs to state that they were
impacted by the disaster.

**B.Basis for Providing Administrative Relief**\
In the event of a disaster, MACs shall grant temporary administrative
relief to any affected providers and suppliers for up to 6 months (or
longer with good cause). Administrative relief is to be granted to
providers/suppliers/beneficiaries on a case-by-case basis in accordance
with the following guidelines:

> 1.**Situation:** A provider/supplier/beneficiary in the affected area
> needs an extension to file a request for an appeal.
>
> **Action:** The MAC shall grant an extension to request an appeal
> under the good cause exception. Please see 42 CFR § 405.942. If the
> request is related to an overpayment, the MAC shall accept the request
> and stop recoupment immediately.
>
> 2.**Situation:** The MAC has requested or needs to request additional
> documentation for a pending appeal, but the
> provider/supplier/beneficiary has been impacted by a disaster.
>
> **Action:** The MAC shall hold the request until the documentation can
> be obtained or submitted. However, to the extent that the contractor
> can use other data sources that are available to substantiate payment
> for the claim, it should do so. The CMS will waive the timeliness
> requirements for processing these appeals.
>
> 3.**Situation:** A request for an appeal filed by an appointed
> representative on behalf of a party contains a missing or defective
> appointment instrument and the party is in the affected area.
>
> **Action:** The contractor shall process the request and attempt to
> obtain the corrected appointment instrument. If the corrected
> appointment instrument is not received by the end of the appeals
> adjudication period, contractors shall send the redetermination
> decision letter to the appellant party and any other party to the
> appeal, but not to the individual attempting to act as the
> representative.
>
> 4.**Situation:** A MAC receives a request for redetermination from a\
> provider/supplier/beneficiary in the affected area and the request is
> missing some of the required elements to make it a valid request.
> However, the MAC has information in the shared systems that would
> allow it to identify the missing element(s).
>
> **Action:** The MAC shall accept and process the request, using
> information already available to it via the shared system.

**C.Verification**\
In the case of complete destruction of medical records where no backup
records exist, MAC Appeal Units and QICs shall accept an attestation
that no medical records exist and consider the services covered and
correctly coded.

**240.5 - Procedures to Follow When a Party Fails to Establish Good
Cause (Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

If a party files an untimely request for redetermination and there is
insufficient or no explanation for the delay or no other evidence that
establishes the reason for late filing, the MAC dismisses the
redetermination request. The MAC explains in the dismissal letter that
the party can: 1) request that the MAC vacate the dismissal by providing
an explanation for the late filing to the MAC within 6 months of the
dismissal of the redetermination request; and 2) request that the QIC
review the MAC's dismissal action by filing a request with the QIC
within 60 days of the date of receipt of the dismissal notice.

If an explanation or other evidence is submitted within 6 months from
the dismissal that contains sufficient evidence or other documentation
that supports a finding of good cause for late filing, the MAC (as
applicable) makes a favorable good cause determination. Once it makes a
favorable good cause\
determination, it considers the appeal to be timely filed and proceeds
to vacate its prior dismissal and performs a redetermination (see
§310.6.3 Processing Requests to Vacate Dismissals).

The closed date is the date of the dismissal, and the dismissal is
reported on the Contractor Reporting of Operational Workload Data
(CROWD) in the appropriate appeals report forms (Carriers Appeals Report
Form CMS-2590, Monthly Intermediary Part A and Part B Appeals Report
Form CMS-2591, or Monthly Statistical Report on Intermediary and Carrier
Part A and Part B Appeals Activity Form CMS-2592). The closed date and
date of dismissal are also captured in the Medicare Appeals System (MAS)
and can be appropriately reported on by the Part A MACs.

**250 - Amount in Controversy (AIC) Requirements**\
**(Rev. 2729, Issued: 06-21-13, Effective: 07-23-13,
Implementation:07-23-13)**

This section is informational only since the amount in controversy
requirements only apply to the ALJ and Federal court levels.

Section 1869 (b)(1)(E) of the Act established amount in controversy
threshold amounts for ALJ hearing requests and judicial review at \$100
and \$1,000, respectively. As amended by section 940 of the MMA, this
amount will be adjusted annually. In order to continue an appeal
following the QIC reconsideration level, a party must have an amount
remaining in controversy that meets the threshold requirements.

**250.1 - Amount in Controversy General Requirements**\
***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:
10- 01-19)***

Each calendar year, the dollar threshold for the AIC requirement for ALJ
hearing requests or judicial review will be recalculated to reflect the
percentage increase in the medical care component of the consumer price
index for all urban consumers (U.S. city average) for July 2003 to the
July preceding the year involved. Any amount that is not a multiple of
\$10 will be rounded to the nearest multiple of \$10. Chin controversy
threshold amounts are published annually in the Federal Register as per

Current AIC amounts*, along with a link to the current Federal Register
AIC Notice,* caCMS.gov website
at:[https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Appeals-and-]{.underline}\

**250.2 - Principles for Determining Amount in Controversy (Rev. 4278,
Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation: 06-13-19)**

As part of the reqring or review before OMHA, a party to a proceeding
must meet including the threshold amount, as adjusted, in accordance
with

The AIC is computed as the actual amount charged the individual for the
items and services in question, reduced by

> (a)Any Medicare payments already made or awarded for the items or
> services; and
>
> (b)Any deductible and coinsurance amounts that may be collected for
> the items or services.

ases where payment is made for items or service of the Act or under or
the liability of the beneficiary is limited under AIC is computed ahat
the bene been charged for [i]{.underline}ces e expenses were not paid
under or that the liability was not limited under reduced by any
deductible and cts that may be collected for the items or

When a matter involves a provider or supplier termination of
Medicare-covered items or services that is disputed by a beneficiary,
and the beneficiary did not e the items or services, the amount in
controversy is calculated in accordance with except that the amount
charged to the individual and any deductible and coinsuted for the items
or services are calculated using the amount the beneficiary would have
been charged if the beneficiary had received the items or services the
beneficiary asserts should have been covered based on the beneficiary\'s
current condition, and Medicare payment were not made for the items or
services.

When an appeal involves an identified overpayment, the amount in
controversy is the amount of the overpayment specified in the demand
letter for the items or services in the disputed claim. When an appeal
involves an estimated overpayment amount determined through the use of
statistical sampling and

extrapolation, the amount in controversy is the total amount of the
estimated overpayment determined through extrapolation, as specified in
the demand letter.

For appeals filed by beneficiaries challenging only the computation of a
coinsurance amount or the amount of a remaining deductible, the amount
in controversy is the difference between the amount of the coinsurance
or remaining deductible, as determined by the contractor, and the amount
of the coinsurance or remaining deductible the beneficiary believes is
correct.

For appeals of claims where the allowable amount has been paid in full
and the appellant is challenging only the validity of the allowable
amount, as reflected on the published fee schedule or in the published
contractor-priced amount applicable to the items or services in the
disputed claim, the amount in controversy is the difference between the
amount the appellant argues should have been the allowable amount for
the items or services in the disputed claim in the applicable
jurisdiction and place of service, and the published allowable amount
for the items or services.

After processing the reconsideration, the QIC shall send written
notification to all parties. This notice shall include any information
concerning the parties' rights to an ALJ hearing, including the
applicable AIC requirements and aggregation provisions.

**250.3 - Aggregation of Claims to Meet the Amount in Controversy (Rev.
4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation: 06-13-19)**

A party appealing a QIC reconsideration to the ALJ level that does not
meet the AIC thrs may, under certain circumstances, aggregate claims to
meet the requirements set forth in

Either an individual appellant or multiple appellants may aggregate two
or more claims trequirements for an ALJ hearing if -

> *a)*The claims were previously reconsidered by a QIC;
>
> *b)*The request for ALJ hearing lists all of the claims to be
> aggregated and is filed within 60 days after receipt of all the
> reconsiderations being appealed; and
>
> c\) The ALJ determines that the claims that a single appellant seeks
> to aggregate involve the delivery of similar or related services, or
> the claims that multiple appellants seek to aggregate involve common
> issues of law and fact. Part A and Part B claims may be combined to
> meet the AIC requirements.

In cases where claims are escalated from the QIC level to the ALJ level
(if parties have met all other requirements), aggregating claims may
proceed under certain circumstances. Either an individual appellant or
multiple appellants may aggregate two or more claims to meet the AIC for
an ALJ hearing if -

> \(a\) The claims were pending before the QIC in conjunction with the
> same request for reconsideration;
>
> \(b\) The appellant(s) requests aggregation of the claims to the ALJ
> level in the same request for escalation; and
>
> \(c\) The ALJ determines that the claims that a single appellant seeks
> to aggregate involve the delivery of similar or related services, or
> the claims that multiple appellants seek to aggregate involve common
> issues of law and fact. Part A and Part B claims may be combined to
> meet the AIC requirements.

When the appellant(s) seeks to aggregate claims in a request for an ALJ
hearing, the appellant(s) must-

> \(a\) Specify all of the claims the appellant(s) seeks to aggregate;
> and
>
> \(b\) State why the appellant(s) believes that the claims involve
> common issues of law and fact or delivery of similar or related
> services.

**260 - Parties to an Appeal**\
**(Rev. 3549, Issued: 06-24-16, Effective: 07-26-16, Implementation:
07-26-16)**

Any of the persons/entities referenced in §210 are parties to an appeal
of a claim for items or services payable under Part A or Part B and,
therefore, may appeal the initial claim determination and any subsequent
administrative appeal determinations or decisions made on all claims for
items or services (assuming other requirements, such as filing within
prescribed time limits are met).

**270 - Appointment of Representative**\
**(Rev. 2729, Issued: 06-21-13, Effective: 07-23-13, Implementation:
07-23-13)**

**NOTE:** See also Section 270.3, "Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP)
Specific Limitations or Additional Requirements with Respect to the
Appointment of Representatives."

**270.1 - Appointment of Representative - Introduction**\
***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:
10- 01-19)***

A party may appoint any individual, including an attorney, to act as
his/her representative in dealings with the MAC. Although some parties
may pursue a claim or an appeal on their own, others will rely upon the
assistance and expertise of others. A representative may help the party
during the processing of a claim or claims, and/or any subsequent
appeal. (See §270.1.8 for details regarding disclosure of individually
identifiable beneficiary information.) The appointment of a
representative is valid for one year from the date signed by both the
party and the appointed representative (see §270.1.5 below).

**NOTE:**

> • The appointment remains valid for any subsequent levels of appeal on
> the item/service in question unless the beneficiary specifically
> withdraws the representative's authority.
>
> • New appeals may be initiated in writing by the representative within
> the one year timeframe unless the beneficiary provides a written
> statement of revocation of the representative's authority.

Appeals for other claims may be initiated utilizing an existing
appointment instrument within one year of the effective date of the
appointment (i.e., the date the appointment instrument is signed by the
party and the representative). To initiate a new appeal within the one
year timeframe, the representative must file a copy of the completed
appointment instrument with the appeal request.

**270.1.1 - Who May Be an Appointed or Authorized Representative (Rev.
4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation: 06-13-19)**

Any individual may be appointed to act as a representative unless he/she
is disqualified, suspended, or otherwise prohibited by law from acting
as a representative in proceedings before HHS, or in entitlement
appeals, before SSA.

A MAC should not accept an appointment of representative if it has
evidence that the appointment of representative should not be honored.
It should notify the party attempting to be represented and the
individual attempting to represent the party that the appointment will
not be honored. A specific individual must be named as the
representative. An organization or entity may not be named as a
representative, but rather a specific member of that organization or
entity must be named. This ensures that confidential beneficiary
information is released only to the individual so named.

A provider or supplier who files an appeal request on behalf of a
beneficiary is not, by virtue of filing the appeal, a representative of
the beneficiary. To act as the beneficiary's representative, the
provider or supplier must execute a valid appointment as described in
this section.

If the requestor is the beneficiary's legal guardian, surrogate
decision-maker for an incapacitated beneficiary, an SSA-appointed
representative payee (See IOM Pub. 100-01, Chapter 6, §10.K. for
information regarding SSA rep payees), or is otherwise authorized under
State law, no appointment is necessary, and the requestor is considered
an **authorized** representative. All MACs shall document the
representative's authority to act on behalf of the beneficiary in the
case file. (See §270.1.7 for information on power of attorney.)

**NOTE:** Billing clerks or billing services employed by the provider or
supplier to prepare and/or bill the initial claim, process the payments,
and/or pursue appeals act as the agent of the provider or supplier and
do not need to be appointed as representative of the provider/supplier.
Include evidence in the case file if the physician or other supplier
employs a billing clerk or billing service (a screen print showing that
payment is made to the billing clerk or billing service is sufficient.)
If the billing clerk/billing service is not authorized to receive
payment, but is authorized to process payments and/or pursue appeals,
include evidence in the case file. If the agreement is on file, make a
notation in the case file where the agreement can be located. (See the
Medicare General Information, Eligibility, and Entitlement Manual, which
allows payment to be made to an agent who furnishes billing or
collection services.)

The following is a list of the types of individuals who could be
appointed to act as representative for a party to an appeal. This list
is not exhaustive, and is meant for illustrative purposes only:

> • Congressional staff members;
>
> • Family members of a beneficiary;
>
> • Friends or neighbors of a beneficiary;
>
> • Member of a beneficiary advocacy group;
>
> • Member of a provider or supplier advocacy group;
>
> • Attorneys; and
>
> • Physicians or suppliers.

**270.1.2 - How to Make and Revoke an Appointment**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

The party making the appointment and the individual accepting the
appointment must either complete an appointment of representative form
(CMS-1696) or use a conforming written instrument (see subsection B
below, for required elements of written instruments). A party may
appoint a representative to assist with filing a claim, or at any time
during the course of an appeal. In order to constitute a valid
appointment, the CMS-1696 or other conforming written instrument must
contain signatures of the representative and the party. By signing the
appointment, the representativeound at:

All signatures may be handwritten or electronic, digital, and/or
digitized. Electronic, digital, and/or digitized signatures are
acceptable for appointment of representative instruments submitted via
mail, facsimile, or a CMS-approved secure Internet portal/application.

CMS permits the use of a rubber stamp in lieu of a handwritten signature
in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in the case of an
author with a physical disability that can provide proof to a CMS
contractor of his or her inability to sign their signature due to their
disability. By affixing the rubber stamp, the person is certifying that
they have reviewed the document.

**A. Completing a Valid Appointment of Representative (Form CMS-1696)**

The CMS-1696 is available for the convenience of the beneficiary or any
other party to use when appointing a representative. Following are
instructions for completing the form.

> 1\. The name of the party making the appointment must be clearly
> legible. If the party being represented is the beneficiary, the
> Medicare number must be provided. If the party being represented is a
> provider or supplier, the National Provider Identified. If the party
> being represented is an applicable plan in an appeal under the space
> may be left blank. A Medicare number is required only when
> thappointing a\
> representative.
>
> 2\. **Completing Section I** -- "Appointment of Representative"- The
> party making the appointment includes their signature, address, and
> phone number. If the party that wishes to appoint a\
> representative is a beneficiary, then only the beneficiary or the
> beneficiary's legal guardian may sign.
>
> If the party making the appointment is the provider or supplier, the
> provider or supplier (or person authorized to act on behalf of the
> provider or supplier) must sign the form and complete this section.
> The date the party signs the form must be included.
>
> 3\. **Completing Section II** -- "Acceptance of Appointment"- A
> specific individual must be named to act as representative in the
> first line of this section; a party may not appoint an organization or
> group to act as representative. The name of the individual appointed
> as representative must always be completed, and his/her relationship
> to the party entered. The individual being appointed signs the form
> with a signature, dates and completes the rest of this section.
>
> 4\. **Completing Section III** -- "Waiver of Fee for Representation"-
> This section must be completed when the beneficiary is appointing a
> provider or supplier as representative, and the provider or supplier
> being appointed has furnished the items or services that are the
> subject of the appeal.
>
> 5\. **Completing Section IV --** "Waiver of Payment for Items or
> Services at Issue" -- This section must be completed when the
> beneficiary is appointing a provider or supplier who furnished
> theservices that are the subject of the appeal and the appeal involves
> issues described in [§]{.underline} of the Act (limitation on
> liability).

If any of the required elements listed above are missing from the
appointment, or are determined to be invalid (e.g., the signatures do
not meet the requirements of this section), the appointment is
considered defective. See §270.1.6 for additional information on
processing appeals with an incomplete or invalid appointment.

Prohibition Against Charging a Fee for Representation

A provider or supplier that furnished items or services to a beneficiary
may represent that beneficiary on the beneficiary's claim or appeal
involving those items or services. However, the provider or supplier may
not charge the beneficiary a fee for representation in this situation.
Further, the provider or supplier\
representative being appointed as representative must waive any fee for
such representation. The provider or supplier representative does this
by completing section III of the CMS-1696. Alternatively, the provider
or supplier must include a statement to this effect on any other
conforming written instrument being used, and must sign and date the
statement.

Waiver of Right to Payment for the Items or Services at Issue

For beneficiary appeals involving a liability determination under of the
Act where the provider or supplier that furnished the items or services
at issue is also servine beneficiary's representative, the provider or
supplier must waive, in writing, any right to payment from the
beneficiary for the items or services at issue (including coinsurance
and deductibles). The provider or supplier representative does this by
completing section IV of the CMS-1696 or other conforming written
instrument, and must sign and date the statement.

The prohibition against charging a fee for representation, and the
waiver of right to payment from the beneficiary for the items or
services at issue, do not apply in those situations in which the
provider or supplier merely submits the appeal request on behalf of the
beneficiary or at the beneficiary's request (i.e., where the provider or
supplier is not also acting as representative for the beneficiary), or
where the items or services at issue were not provided by the provider
or supplier when the provider or supplier has been appointed as the
beneficiary's representative.

**B. Required Elements for Written Request (if not using the CMS-1696
form)**

As set forth in a written request for an appointment of representation
must:

> *1.*Be in writing and be signed and dated by both the party and the
> individual agreeing to be the representative;
>
> *2.*Provide a statement appointing the representative to act on behalf
> of the party, and authorizing the adjudicator to release identifiable
> health information to the appointed representative;
>
> *3.*Include a written explanation of the purpose and scope of the
> representation;
>
> *4.*Contain both the party's and appointed representative's name,
> phone number, and address;
>
> *5.*Contain a unique identifier of the party being represented. If the
> party being represented is the beneficiary, the Medicare number must
> be provided. If the party being represented is a provider or supplier,
> the National Provider Identifier numbeption: An applicable plan
> appointing a representative in an appeal under is not required to
> include a unique identifier);
>
> *6.*Include the appointed representative's professional status or
> relationship to the party; and
>
> *7.*Be filed with the entity processing the party's initial
> determination or appeal.

Providers or suppliers that are representing a beneficiary and that
furnished the items or services at issue must complete a "Wf Fee for
Representation". In addition, if the appeal involves a liability
determination under of the Act, the provider or supplier must also
complete a "Waiver of Payment for Items or Services at See §270.1.2.A.4
and 5.

**C. Revoking an Appointment**

The party appointing a representative may revoke the appointment at any
time by providing a written statement of revocation to the contractor.

**270.1.3 - When and Where to Submit the Appointment**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

A representative, beneficiary, or other party may submit the completed
appointment to the contractor at the time such person files a claim or
request for appeal or at any time during the processing of the appeal.
Appointed representatives are responsible for submitting a valid
appointment instrument with each new

appeal request. A valid appointment instrument submitted with an appeal
request will be included in the appeal case file and is valid for
subsequent levels of appeal for the item(s)/service(s)/claims(s) at
issue.

With each new appeal request, an appointed representative may choose to
send either an original appointment instrument, or a photocopy of the
original. Should a photocopy of the original appointment instrument be
submitted with an appeal request, the original appointment instrument
must be maintained by the representative or the party, and produced upon
request. If an appeal or other motion is filed by a representative on
behalf of a party to the appeal, but does not include an appointment,
the contractor takes the actions specified below in §270.1.6 to secure
the written appointment.

If a valid CMS-1696, or other conforming written instrument, has
previously been filed with the contractor, the representative is
encouraged, but not required, to submit a copy at subsequent levels of
appeal. A valid appointment instrument will be included in the case file
for subsequent levels of the appeal of the item(s)/service(s)/claim(s)
at issue. However, if a new appeal for different items/services/claims
is initiated during the one year timeframe of the appointment, a copy of
the appointment must be filed with the new appeal request.

If a contractor has received CMS approval for, and is accepting appeals
through, the use of a secure Internet portal/application (See
310.1.B.2.c), contractors should provide instructions to appellants
using the Internet portal/application on how to submit the appointment
instrument when submitting an appeal.

**270.1.4 - Rights and Responsibilities of a Representative**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

In representing an appellant before a MAC, the representative has
certain rights and responsibilities.

**A. Authority of an Appointed Representative**

A representative may represent a party in an appeal of a claim. An
appointed representative may, on behalf of the party; obtain appeal
information about the claim to the same extent as the party, submit
evidence, make statements about facts and law, and make any request, or
give or receive, any notice about the appeal proceedings.

When a MAC takes action or issues a redetermination, it shall send
notice to only the appointed representative. Notice shall not be sent to
the party if there is an appointed representative.

The MAC shall send any requests for information or evidence regarding an
appeal only to the appointed representative.

See also, §270.3 for MSP specific requirements.

**B. Responsibilities of an Appointed Representative**

An appointed representative must-

> • Inform the party of the scope and responsibilities of the
> representation;
>
> • Inform the party of the status of the appeal and the results of
> actions taken on behalf of the party such as notification of appeal
> determinations, decisions, and further appeal rights;
>
> • Disclose to a beneficiary any financial risk and liability of a
> non-assigned claim that the beneficiary may have;
>
> • Not act contrary to the interest of the party; and
>
> • Comply with all laws and CMS regulations, CMS Rulings, and
> instructions.

The appointment of a representative by a party must be made freely and
without coercion. The MAC should assume that a representative is not
making false or misleading statements, representations, or claims about
any material fact affecting any person's rights. However, if the MAC has
reason to believe that the representative is making false or misleading
statements, representations or claims about any material fact affecting
any person's rights, it should refer the matter to the Unified Program
Integrity Contractor (UPIC), which were formerly known as Zone Program
Integrity Contractors. A representative will have access to personal and
confidential medical and other information about a beneficiary. The MAC
may assume that the representative will not disclose personal or
confidential information about a beneficiary except as necessary to
pursue an appeal on behalf of the party represented. Further, it may
assume that a representative is not disclosing any personal or
confidential medical or other information about a beneficiary(ies)
outside of the appeals process.

Unless otherwise directed by the party making the appointment, the MAC
need not keep the represented party informed of the purpose of the
appointment, the scope of the appointment, and exactly when/under what
circumstances the appointment will be exercised, since it may assume the
representative has taken on this responsibility. It is the
responsibility of the representative to keep the party informed on the
progress of an appeal.

**C. Delegation of Appointment by Appointed Representative**

An appointed representative may delegate the appointment if the
following conditions are met;

> • The appointed representative provides written notice to the party of
> the appointed representative's intent to delegate to another
> individual. The notice must include the name of the designee and the
> designee's acceptance to be obligated and comply with the requirements
> or representation under this subpart.
>
> • The party accepts the designation by signing a written statement to
> that effect. This signed statement is not required when the appointed
> representative and designee are attorneys in the same law firm or
> organization.

**270.1.5 - Duration of Appointment**\
**(Rev. 2926, Issued: 04-11-14, Effective: 07-14-14, Implementation:
07-14-14)**

An appointment is considered valid for 1 year from the date that the
CMS-1696 or other conforming written instrument contains the signatures
of both the party and appointed representative. Requiring that a new
appointment be executed on a yearly basis will help ensure that there is
an ongoing relationship between the party and his/her representative.

Appeals for other claims may be initiated utilizing an existing
appointment instrument within one year of the effective date of the
appointment (i.e. the date a completed appointment instrument is signed
by the party and the appointed representative). When initiating a new
appeal within the one year timeframe, the representative must file a
copy of the completed appointment instrument with the appeal request.
Allowing the representative to use the same appointment for up to one
year will help reduce the paperwork involved in representing parties.
The MAC may also place information about appointment validity in
provider newsletters, bulletins, educational materials, etc.

The appointment remains valid throughout any and all subsequent levels
of administrative appeal on the claim or claims at issue. Therefore, the
representative need not secure a new appointment when proceeding to the
next level of appeal on the same items, services or claim(s). This holds
true regardless of the length of time it may take to resolve the appeal.

**270.1.6 - Curing a Defective Appointment of Representative *(Rev.
4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation: 10-
01-19)***

If any of the required elements listed in §270.1.2 are missing, the
appointment of representative form is considered defective.

How a MAC handles these situations depends on the party attempting to
make an appointment. When the beneficiary attempts to make the
appointment, the MAC provides assistance to the beneficiary and
representative in securing the appointment, based on the time frames set
forth below. When a provider or physician or other supplier attempts to
make the appointment, the MAC provides instruction on the proper and
timely completion of the appointment. Where an adjudication time frame
applies, the time from the later of the date that a defective
appointment of representative was filed or the current appeal request
was filed by the prospective appointed representative, to the date when
the defect was cured, the party notifies the adjudicator that he or she
will proceed with the appeal without a representative, or the 30-day
deadline for curing the defect has elapsed with no response, does not
count towards the adjudication time frame.The following provides
guidance on properly responding to a representative's attempt to submit
a request for appeal.

**A. Missing or Defective Appointment When a Beneficiary is the
Represented Party**

> **1.Defective Appointment of Representative**
>
> When an individual is attempting to act as a beneficiary's
> representative, but submits an incomplete or defective appointment
> instrument, the MAC shall advise the individual of how to complete the
> appointment, and shall notify the individual to submit the completed
> appointment to the MAC within 30 calendar days. The MAC shall advise
> the individual of what corrections are required to execute a valid
> appointment and that a decision letter will not be sent to the
> individual unless a valid appointment is executed. Should the
> appointment instrument not be corrected within 30 calendar days, the
> MAC proceeds with processing and rendering a decision on the appeal,
> unless there is evidence or information to indicate the appeal was not
> submitted at the request of the beneficiary. It sends the appeal
> decision to the beneficiary and any other party to the appeal, but not
> to the individual attempting to act as the beneficiary's
> representative.
>
> This will ensure that the beneficiary receives an appeal decision when
> it appears that the appeal originated with the beneficiary or was
> submitted with the beneficiary's knowledge and consent.
>
> When there is information or evidence that the appeal request and/or
> the appointment of representative instrument was not submitted at the
> request of the beneficiary, the MAC shall verify the beneficiary's
> wishes with regard to the appeal (e.g., where more than one member of
> the beneficiary's family has submitted an appeal or is attempting to
> act as representative for the beneficiary). In order to verify the
> wishes of the beneficiary, the MAC sends a letter to the beneficiary
> explaining the situation. The letter shall advise the beneficiary that
> in order to proceed with an appeal, a valid appointment instrument
> must be submitted within 30 calendar days. If no response is received
> within 30 calendar days then the appointment of representative will
> not be honored, and no redetermination will be performed. The MAC
> shall handle this as an inquiry.
>
> **2.Missing Appointment of Representative**
>
> In cases of appeals filed on behalf of the beneficiary, the MAC need
> not develop an absent appointment of representative if the request for
> redetermination clearly shows the beneficiary knew of or approved the
> submission of the request for redetermination. It sends the appeal
> decision to the beneficiary and any other party to the appeal, but not
> to the individual attempting to act as the beneficiary's
> representative.
>
> This will ensure that the beneficiary receives an appeal decision when
> it appears that the appeal was submitted with the beneficiary's
> knowledge and consent.
>
> When there is information or evidence that the appeal request filed on
> behalf of the beneficiary was not submitted at the request of the
> beneficiary, the MAC shall verify the beneficiary's wishes with regard
> to the appeal (e.g., where more than one member of the beneficiary's
> family has submitted an appeal or is attempting to act as
> representative for the beneficiary but does not include an appointment
> instrument). In order to verify the wishes of the beneficiary, the MAC
> sends a letter to the beneficiary explaining the situation. The letter
> shall advise the beneficiary that a valid appointment instrument must
> be submitted within 30 calendar days in order to process the appeal.
> If no response is received within 30 calendar days, then the MAC does
> not conduct a redetermination. The MAC shall handle this as an
> inquiry.

**B. Defective or Missing Appointment When a Provider or Physician,
Other Supplier, or Nonbeneficiary is the Represented Party**

> **1.Defective Appointment of Representative**
>
> In cases where the represented party is **not** a beneficiary, the MAC
> notifies both the individual attempting to be the representative and
> the party of the incomplete or defective appointment. The MAC explains
> why the appointment is defective, and describes the documentation or
> missing information that is required to complete the appointment. This
> may be done by telephone or written notification, and the method, time
> and date of any notification shall be documented in the case file. A
> corrected/completed appointment may be submitted to the MAC by mail,
> or at the MAC's discretion by facsimile or (if available) secure
> Internet portal. The MAC allows 30 calendar days for the corrected
> appointment instrument to be submitted. Should the party fail to
> notify the MAC to proceed with the appeal without a representative, or
> the appointment instrument is **not** corrected within the time limit,
> the MAC **dismisses** the appeal request and sends a dismissal notice
> to the party (See §310.6.A.4).
>
> **2.Missing Appointment of Representative**
>
> If an individual is attempting to act as a representative of a party
> that is **not** the beneficiary and fails to include an appointment
> instrument with the appeal request, the individual lacks the authority
> to act on behalf of the party, and is not entitled to obtain or
> receive any information related to the appeal. The MAC shall notify
> the individual that no redetermination will be performed until a valid
> request is received from the party or a valid appointment instrument
> is resubmitted with the redetermination request. The MAC shall handle
> this as an inquiry (see §310.1.B.*5*).

**C. Untimely Appeal Request Submitted With an Incomplete or Defective
Appointment**

If an untimely-filed appeal request is submitted with an incomplete or
defective appointment instrument, the MAC first determines if good cause
for late filing exists (See §240). If the MAC finds that good cause for
late filing exists, it follows the instructions contained in §270.1.6,
above, prior to proceeding with the appeal request. If the MAC does not
find good cause to extend the filing time limit, it dismisses the
redetermination request. See §310.6.3 and §310.6.A.3.

**D. Untimely Appeal Request Submitted With a Missing Appointment**

> **1.Missing Appointment when the Beneficiary is the Party**
>
> If an untimely-filed appeal request is submitted by an individual
> attempting to represent a beneficiary and the request does not include
> an appointment instrument, the MAC first determines if good cause for
> late filing exists (See §240). If the MAC finds that good cause for

> §270.1.6.A.2. prior to proceeding with the appeal request. If the MAC

> Nonbeneficiary is the** **Represented Party**
>
> As explained in §270.1.6.B.2 above, if the individual lacks the
> authority to act on behalf of the party and is not entitled to obtain
> or receive any information related to the appeal, do not make a good
> cause determination; follow the instructions in §270.1.6.B.2. above.

**270.1.7 - Incapacitation or Death of Beneficiary**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

If at any time after the execution of a valid appointment or
**nondurable** power of attorney the beneficiary becomes incapacitated
and is unable to manage his/her affairs, the appointment becomes
invalid. The MAC shall resolve who has legal authority to act on behalf
of the beneficiary before disclosing any further information pursuant to
the appointment or nondurable power of attorney.

If the beneficiary has executed a **durable** power of attorney that
authorizes the designated person to conduct the beneficiary's affairs,
or to make financial decisions on behalf of the beneficiary, the
representation does not become invalid upon the beneficiary's subsequent
incapacitation.

**NOTE:** Some durable powers of attorney do not become effective until
and unless such an incapacitation occurs.

The death of a party terminates the authority of the appointed
representative. However, if an appeal is in progress and another
individual or entity may be entitled to receive or obligated to make
payment for the items or services that are the subject of the appeal,
the appointment remains in effect for the duration of the appeal. See
also, §270.3 for MSP specific limitations or additional requirements.

If the beneficiary is deceased, the legal representative of the estate
may file an appeal. In the absence of a legal representative, any person
who has assumed responsibility for settling the decedent's estate may
file the appeal. In these situations, the MAC shall obtain proof that
the person has assumed responsibility for settling the decedent's estate
(e.g., a will or probate court document). What is acceptable as legal
documentation may vary according to State law. The MAC shall notify the
person filing the appeal about the documentation needed to s how the
person is either the legal representative of the estate or the person
who has assumed responsibility for settling the decedent\'s estate and
describe the types of documentation needed. Allow at least 14 calendar
days for the documentation to be submitted. If, at the end of the time
allowed, the documentation needed is not submitted, dismiss the request.
If the appellant submits the documentation after the allotted time, the
MAC considers good cause for late filing. In such instances, the MAC
documents the file to show the basis for that person's filing the
appeal.

MACs shall follow state law when determining proper parties to initial
determinations and appeals. Legal representatives of deceased
beneficiaries can be proper parties to initial determinations and
appeals. In order to verify that the requester is the proper
representative, MACs shall be aware of the current state laws in their
jurisdictions and shall accept any documentation acceptable by the
appropriate state. The\
documentation must be sufficient to verify that the individual making
the request is a proper and valid representative for purposes of initial
determinations and appeals under 42 CFR Part 405. Examples of proper
documentation based on state law include, but are not necessarily
limited to:

> •Probate court documents (such as, letters of administration or
> letters of testamentary to an executor named in the deceased
> beneficiary's will).
>
> •The deceased beneficiary's will naming the executor.
>
> •Appointment of Representative document (CMS-1696 form or other
> similar document).
>
> •An instrument executed by a beneficiary that confers representative
> authority in accordance with state law (for example, health care proxy
> appointment, Power of Attorney form, or Durable Power of Attorney
> form).
>
> •Representative appointment made by a court of law on behalf of a
> deceased beneficiary that has not named an executor to handle his or
> her estate.
>
> Examples of insufficient documentation include:\
> •Claims against the decedent's estate without an authorized
> representative listed.
>
> •Any unsigned writing conferring authority on the party to act as a
> legal representative.
>
> •The beneficiary's certificate of death.

4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation: 06-13-19)**

The beneficiary making the transfer (assignor) and the provider or
supplier accepting the transfer (assignee) must complete the CMS
standardized Transfer of Appeal Rights form (Form CMS-20031). This form
is entitled, "Transfer of Appeal Rights". **No alternative written
instrument may be used.** Signatures may be handwritten, electronic,
digital, and/or digitized. By signing the CMS-20031, the provider
indicates his/her acceptance of being the assignee. Page two of the form
provides information to the beneficiary about te at:

**A. Completing a valid Transfer of Appeal Rights Form CMS-20031**

Form CMS-20031, Transfer of Appeal Rights, is the required form that
beneficiaries must use to assign their appeal rights. Following are
instructions for completing form CMS-20031.

> 1.**Completing Section I -** The name of the beneficiary transferring
> appeal rights must be clearly legible. The beneficiary's Medicare
> number must be provided in this section. This section includes name,
> Medicare number, address and phone number, and the item or service
> that is at issue. The beneficiary must provide a signature on the
> transfer statement and include the date. Only the beneficiary may sign
> this section.
>
> 2\. **Completing Section II** - "Acceptance of Appeal Rights" - The
> provider or supplier accepting the appeal rights must complete this
> section. This section includes name, address, and phone number. The
> provider or supplier must sign this section to accept the transfer of
> appeal rights and agree not to collect payment (except for any
> applicable deductible or coinsurance) from the beneficiary for the
> item or service at issue, unless a valid Advance Beneficiary Notice of
> Noncoverage (ABN) is in effect.

If an incomplete form is submitted, the adjudicator should contact the
party and provide a description of the missing information. Unless the
defect is cured, the provider or supplier lacks the authority to accept
the appeal rights of the beneficiary, and is not entitled to take action
regarding the appeal or obtain or receive any information related to the
appeal, including the appeal decision. The adjudicator **should not**
dismiss the appeal request because the transfer of appeal rights is not
valid.

CMS permits the use of a rubber stamp in lieu of a handwritten signature
in accordance with the\
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in the case of an author with a physical
disability that can provide proof to a CMS MAC of his or her inability
to sign their signature due to their disability. By affixing the rubber
stamp, the person is certifying that they have reviewed the document.

**B. Waiver of Right to Payment for the Items or Services at Issue**

The provider or supplier who accepts the appeal rights must waive the
right to collect payment from the beneficiary for the item or service
that is the subject of the appeal. The provider or supplier may collect
any applicable deductible or coinsurance. The provider or supplier
agrees to this waiver by completing and signing Section II of the
Transfer of Appeal Rights form. The waiver to collect payment remains in
effect regardless of the outcome of the appeal decision.

This waiver remains valid unless the transfer is revoked **by the
beneficiary** as described in subsection D, below.

**C. Duration of a Valid Transfer of Appeal Rights**

Unless revoked, the transfer of appeal rights is valid for all levels of
the appeal process including judicial review, even in the event of the
death of the beneficiary.

**D. Revoking a Transfer of Appeal Rights**

The party assigning their appeal rights may revoke the transfer of
appeal rights by providing a written statement of revocation to the
adjudicator at any time. If revoked, the rights to appeal revert to the
beneficiary. The transfer may be revoked in the following ways:

> 1\. In writing by the beneficiary. The revocation must be delivered to
> the adjudicator and the provider or supplier and is effective on the
> date of receipt by the adjudicator.
>
> 2\. By abandonment if the assignee does not file an appeal of an
> unfavorable decision to the financial interests of the beneficiary.

**270.2.4 - When to Submit the Transfer of Appeal Rights**\
**(Rev. 1274, Issued: 06-29-07, Effective: 07-01-07, Implementation:
10-01-07)**

A provider or supplier may submit the completed transfer of appeal
rights form to the MAC at the time he or she submits an appeal request.
The provider or supplier may obtain the completed transfer of appeal
rights form from the beneficiary at the time that the services are
provided, and file the previously signed form with the appeal.

**270.2.5 - Where to Submit the Transfer of Appeal Rights**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

When the provider or supplier submits the original or a copy of the
signed transfer of appeal rights form, the MAC shall place it in the
case file. The provider or supplier should also give the beneficiary a
copy of the completed form.

If a contractor has received CMS approval for, and is accepting appeals
through, the use of a secure Internet portal/application (See
310.1.B.2.c), contractors should provide instructions to appellants
using the Internet portal/application on how to submit a copy of the
signed transfer of appeal rights form when submitting an appeal.

**270.2.6 - Rights of the Assignee of Appeal Rights**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

When a valid transfer of appeal rights is executed, the beneficiary
transfers all appeal rights involving the item or service at issue to
the provider or supplier.

The transfer of appeal rights by a beneficiary must be made freely and
without coercion. The MAC shall assume that a provider or supplier is
not making false or misleading statements, representations or claims
about any material fact affecting any person's rights. However, if the
MAC has reason to believe that the assignee is making false or
misleading statements, representations or claims about any material fact
affecting any person's rights, it shall refer the matter to the UPIC. A
provider or supplier accepting the transfer of appeal rights will have
access to personal and confidential medical and other information about
a beneficiary. The MAC shall assume that the provider or supplier will
not disclose personal or confidential information about a beneficiary
except as necessary to pursue an appeal on behalf of the party
represented. Further, it shall assume that a provider or supplier is not
disclosing any personal or confidential medical or other information
about a beneficiary outside of the appeals process.

A beneficiary transfers all appeal rights involving the item or service
at issue to the provider or supplier, these include, but are not limited
to:

> 1\. Obtaining information about the claim to the same extent as the
> beneficiary; 2. Submitting evidence;
>
> 3\. Making statements about facts or law; and\
> 4. Making any request, or giving, or receiving any notice about appeal
> proceedings.

When a MAC takes action or issues a redetermination, it shall send
notice to only the assignee. Notice shall not be sent to the beneficiary
if there is an assignee.

The MAC shall send any requests for information or evidence regarding an
appeal only to the assignee.

**270.2.7 - Duration of Transfer of Appeal Rights**\
**(Rev. 1274, Issued: 06-29-07, Effective: 07-01-07, Implementation:
10-01-07)**

Unless revoked the transfer of appeal rights is valid for all levels of
appeal including judicial review. This transfer remains in effect even
in the event of the death of the beneficiary.

**270.2.8 - Curing a Defective Transfer of Appeal Rights**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

If any one of the elements is missing from the CMS-20031, the MAC shall
contact the party and provide a description of the missing documentation
or information. If the defect is not cured, the prospective assignee of
appeal rights lacks the authority to act on behalf of the party, and is
not entitled to obtain or receive any information related to the appeal,
including the appeal decision.

The MAC shall provide help and assistance to the beneficiary and
provider or supplier in securing the transfer of appeal rights, based on
the time frames set forth below.

**A. Timely Filed Appeal Request with a Defective Transfer of Appeal
Rights**

When an incomplete or defective transfer of appeal rights form is
received, the MAC shall notify both the provider/supplier submitting the
CMS-20031 and the beneficiary. The MAC shall advise them why the
transfer is defective, and describe the missing information that is
required to complete the transfer. This may be done by telephone or
written notification. The method, time and date of any notification
shall be documented in the case file. A corrected/completed transfer may
be submitted to the MAC by mail, or at the MAC's discretion, by
facsimile or a secure Internet portal/application, within 14 days.
Should the CMS-20031 not be corrected within this time limit, the MAC
proceeds with processing and rendering a decision on the appeal. It
sends the appeal decision to the beneficiary and any other party to the
appeal, but not to the unauthorized assignee. This will ensure that the
beneficiary receives an appeal, as the presumption here is that the
appeal originated with the beneficiary and was submitted with the
beneficiary's knowledge and consent. However, if the MAC has information
or evidence that the transfer was not submitted at the request of the
beneficiary, it shall not conduct the appeal unless and/or until it
receives confirmation from the beneficiary that the request was
submitted with the beneficiary's approval.

**B. Untimely Appeal Request Submitted With an Incomplete or Defective
Transfer**

Because an untimely-filed appeal request is not always dismissed (e.g.,
there could be the finding of good cause for late filing, see §240.1),
an incomplete or defective CMS-20031 may, in some cases, need to be
corrected. If an incomplete or defective CMS-20031 needs to be
corrected, the MAC shall follow the instructions contained in Section A
above, prior to proceeding with the appeal request.

**C. Untimely Appeal Request Submitted With a Valid Transfer**

These cases should be resolved solely on the basis of whether there is

**270.2.9 - Disclosure of Individually Identifiable Beneficiary
Information to Assignees (Rev. 2729, Issued: 06-21-13, Effective:
07-23-13, Implementation: 07-23-13)**

In accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Act, before the MAC may
release beneficiary-specific information to an assignee, the beneficiary
must complete and sign a CMS-20031 naming that individual as his/her
assignee. The MAC shall use caution in releasing beneficiary-specific
information to assignees. The assignee is entitled to receive only
information that an appointed representative would be entitled to
receive (e.g., the determination letter) and that which is pertinent to
the case/claim for which appeal rights have been assigned.

A beneficiary must explicitly authorize the release of any information
that is not specific to the case/claim for which appeal rights have been
assigned. Any questions as to whether information needs authorization to
be released to an assignee can be directed to the appropriate CMS
regional office (RO).

For more information about the disclosure of identifiable information
about beneficiaries, see the Medicare General Information, Eligibility,
and Entitlement Manual, Pub. 100-01, Chapter 6.

**270.3 - Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) Specific Limitations or
Additional Requirements with Respect to the Appointment of
Representatives**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

The following instructions/rules apply with respect to MSP recovery
claims[,]{.underline} not withstanding any language to the contrary in
other subsections of "Section 270 Appointment of
Repres[e]{.underline}ntative."

For a MSP recovery claim involving a beneficiary debtor, the
representative relationship typically arises in the context of the
beneficiary's claim against a workers' compensation plan, liability
insurance (including self-insurance), or no-fault insurance. The
representative is not hired solely to represent the beneficiary with
respect to the recovery demand letter/debt at issue on appeal; the
representative is routinely hired in connection with an underlying
liability, no-fault or workers\' compensation claim.

For MSP recovery claims involving a debtor other than a beneficiary or a
provider/supplier, follow the instructions in the MSP IOM, Pub. 100-05,
Chapter 7, section 10, regarding authorization to represent a debtor.
For MSP recovery claims involving a provider/supplier debtor, follow the
instructions for non-MSP.

The instructions below contain exceptions or additions to the non-MSP
rules for MSP recovery claims **involving a beneficiary debtor**.

**A. Appointment of Representative**

For MSP recovery claims involving a beneficiary debtor, the
representative relationship may be established in the following ways
(the document must always include the beneficiary's Medicare number as
well as his/her name):

> 1.If the representative is an attorney, by:
>
> •A copy of the fee agreement between the beneficiary and the attorney,
> signed by the beneficiary and signed/countersigned by the attorney,
>
> •A statement on the attorney's letterhead accompanied by a release
> signed by the beneficiary, or
>
> •A document compliant with the non-MSP rules.
>
> 2.If the representative is a non-attorney, follow the non-MSP rules.
> However, note that information may be released to a non-representative
> regardless of whether or not there is a proper appointment of
> representative if the individual or entity has a proper HIPAA
> compliant release from the beneficiary.

**B. Duration of Appointment**

The duration of the appointment lasts until revoked by the beneficiary
absent specific language in the appointment document limiting the
duration of appointment. This is true regardless of whether or not an
appeal has been filed within 1 year of the date of the appointment.

**C. Correspondence**

Both the beneficiary and the representative shall receive copies of all
correspondence (including all appeals determinations).

**D. Death of a Beneficiary**

The death of the beneficiary terminates the authority of any
representative appointed by the beneficiary. The representative must
obtain a new appointment from the beneficiary's estate or the individual
assuming responsibility for the estate if there is no formally appointed
executor.

**280 - Fraud and Abuse**\
**(Rev. 1274, Issued: 06-29-07, Effective: 07-01-07, Implementation:
10-01-07)**

**280.1 - Fraud and Abuse - Authority**\
**(Rev. 2926, Issued: 04-11-14, Effective: 07-14-14, Implementation:
07-14-14)**

To protect tud ase, civil and criminal violation provisions have been
included in and of the Act.

**280.2 - Inclusion and Consideration of Evidence of Fraud and/or Abuse
(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

The MAC shall inquire fully into the matters at issue by receiving, in
evidence, the testimony of witnesses and any documents that are relevant
to the claims at issue. If the MAC believes that evidence has been
tampered with, it shall refer this documentation to either the medical
review or the UPIC's units for their follow-up.

The MAC may receive evidence obtained and provided by the UPIC
concerning fraud or potential fraud with respect to the claim(s) at
issue. If the UPIC provides such evidence, it becomes part of the case
file and must be made available for inspection by the appellant prior to
the reconsideration. Evidence of this nature is to be evaluated to
determine issues such as whether, in conjunction with other credible
evidence, the services in question were actually provided or were
provided as billed.

**NOTE:** See §300.3 for additional information regarding fraud and
abuse investigations.

**280.3 - Claims Where There is Evidence That Items or Services Were Not
Furnished or Were Not Furnished as Billed**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

Where there is a substantial basis for determining that an item or
service either was not furnished or was not furnished as billed, the MAC
may deny or down-code payment, as appropriate. The reviewer must ensure
that the case file clearly documents the evidence that formed the basis
for the determination. Appeal rights after such a determination remain
the same as they would for any other unfavorable decision. If the MAC
has reason to believe or evidence to support that items or services were
not furnished or were not furnished as billed, it shall send a copy of
the decision to its UPIC.

**280.4 - Responsibilities of Adjudicators**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

If, during the course of the redetermination, the reviewer suspects a
civil or criminal law violation, the reviewer shall render a decision
only on the coverage or payment issues raised by the redetermination
request. Although the reviewer cannot make a determination of civil or
criminal fraud, he/she may still deny or reduce payment if he/she
believes that the items or services at issue were not rendered, or were
not rendered as billed (as discussed above). In making this
determination, the reviewer may consider all available evidence that is
included in the case file, including witness testimony, medical records,
and evidence compiled through a fraud investigation, as discussed above.
(See §310.4.B below.) In addition to denying the claims because the
services were not rendered as billed, if the reviewer suspects fraud,
he/she shall forward information regarding the potential civil or
criminal violation to the UPIC. For further discussion on Medicare fraud
issues, refer to the Medicare Program Integrity Manual, IOM 100-08,
Chapter 4.

**280.5 - Requests to Suspend the Appeals Process**\
**(Rev. 2729, Issued: 06-21-13, Effective: 07-23-13, Implementation:
07-23-13)**

The MAC does not have the authority to suspend redeterminations at the
request of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) or the Department
of Justice (DOJ) without approval and direction from CMS central office
(CO). If the OIG or DOJ submits a request to suspend a redetermination,
the MAC shall first bring that request to the attention of CO through
the RO.

**280.6 - Continuing Appeals of Providers, Physicians, or Other
Suppliers Who are Under Fraud or Abuse Investigations**\
**(Rev. 1274, Issued: 06-29-07, Effective: 07-01-07, Implementation:
10-01-07)**

Reviewers shall continue adjudicating the appeals of Medicare claims
submitted by a provider, physician, or other supplier who is being or
has been investigated, indicted, or convicted for fraud or abuse on
other Medicare claims, or who is on Medicare payment suspension, unless
the MAC has been informed that the provider, physician, or other
supplier has agreed, as part of a settlement with the Government, or as
the result of a prosecution, to withdraw the appealed claims or to waive
the right to appeal the subject claim(s).

If it has received notice of such a settlement, the MAC shall dismiss
the appeal based on the fact that the appellant has waived his/her/its
right to an appeal, and/or agreed to withdraw appeal of these claims as
part of a settlement agreement with the Government. The MAC places a
copy of the settlement document or other evidence of a settlement in the
file. A reviewer shall remain neutral in the adjudication of claims that
involve a provider, physician, or other supplier who is being or has
been investigated, indicted or convicted of fraud or abuse.

**280.7 - Appeals of Claims Involving Excluded Providers, Physicians, or
Other Suppliers**\
**(Rev. 3549, Issued: 06-24-16, Effective: 07-26-16, Implementation:
07-26-16)**

The appeals process remains in effect for all claims with service dates
prior to the effective date of exclusion. An excluded provider,
physician, or supplier, or the beneficiary may appeal such claims. In
addition, if the billing privileges of a provider, physician, or
supplier are revoked retroactively, and the contractor reopens
previously paid claims to assess an overpayment against the excluded
party, the excluded party (or the beevised initial determination and
overpayment under the claims appeal process [.]{.underline}

**NOTE:** A provider or supplier\'s appeal of lingessed in accordance
with the procedures set forth in and (see also, IOM 100-08, Chapter 15,
§15.25). The contractoe renless billing privileges are reinstated under
the enrollment appeals process.

**290 - Guidelines for Writing Appeals Correspondence**\
**(Rev. 1274, Issued: 06-29-07, Effective: 07-01-07, Implementation:
10-01-07)**\
The guidelines in this section are to be used when preparing appeals
correspondence, which includes redeterminations decisions and inquiries
about the status of appeals. These shall be handled as expeditiously as
possible without lowering the quality of the response. General
instructions on responding to beneficiary and provider/supplier
communications are found in CMS Medicare Pub. 100-09. All other
CMS-issued instructions on correspondence guidelines apply as well,
including instructions on correspondence letterhead requirements.

**290.1 - General Guidelines**\
**(Rev. 2729, Issued: 06-21-13, Effective: 07-23-13, Implementation:
07-23-13)**\
MACs shall prepare appeals correspondence so the appellant can easily
understand both the reason why any of the services were not covered or
could not be fully reimbursed, and what action the appellant can take if
the appellant disagrees with that decision. In addition, the guidelines
listed here should be followed to the extent possible:\
• Keep the language as simple as possible;\
• Do not use abbreviations or jargon;\
• Choose a positive rather than a negative tone, whenever possible.
Avoid words or phrases that emphasize what cannot be done by the MAC or
the appellant;\
• If possible, avoid one sentence paragraphs, uneven spacing between
paragraphs, etc.;\
• Apologize when appropriate, e.g., if the response is late. However, do
not apologize for\
enforcing Medicare guidelines that may be adverse to the appellant's
claim;\
• Summarize the question before providing a response; and,\
• Use correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation.

**290.2 - Letter Format**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**\
Appeals correspondence shall follow the instructions issued by CMS for
MAC written correspondence letterhead requirements unless otherwise
instructed and/or agreed to by CMS. In addition, observe the following
information:\
• Numerical dates must not be used (i.e., instead of 6/16/13, use June
16, 2013), except when included in a table;\
• Type/font size must be 12 point or larger (all responses are to be
processed using a font size of 12 and a font style of Universal or Times
New Roman or similar style for the ease of reading by the beneficiary
and the provider);\
• When the subject matter is lengthy or complicated, bullet points
should be used to clarify, if possible;\
• For long letters, headings should be used to break it up (e.g.,
DECISION,\
BACKGROUND, RATIONALE);

> • If procedure codes are cited, the actual name of the procedure must
> be associated with the code;
>
> • Span dates may not be used for 1 day of service; and
>
> • The MAC should not use all capital letters. Letters that contain all
> capital letters appear impersonal and computer generated.

Refer to §300.5 for instructions on how to handle cases involving
multiple beneficiaries, including overpayment cases involving multiple
beneficiaries.

**290.3 - How to Establish Reading Level**\
**(Rev. 1274, Issued: 06-29-07, Effective: 07-01-07, Implementation:
10-01-07)**

The MMA requires that appeals correspondence be written in a manner
calculated to be understood by beneficiaries. MACs shall write appeals
correspondence that is understandable to beneficiaries. The purpose of
this section is to provide some guidance to MACs on writing letters that
are easy for beneficiaries to understand. To achieve this goal, MACs
shall:

\(1\) Write in plain English/plain language with a clear, simple,
conversational writing style with good communication of key points.

\(2\) Get reading levels of letters as low as you can without losing
important content or distorting the meaning and without sounding
condescending to the reader.

**NOTE:** This requirement does not apply to providers. MACs can use a
cover sheet for the beneficiary, when sending a copy of the decision.

**290.3.1 - Writing in Plain Language**\
**(Rev. 1274, Issued: 06-29-07, Effective: 07-01-07, Implementation:
10-01-07)**

The following are some tips to help MACs to write letters in plain
language:

> • Include definitions or explain terms you must use that are not
> familiar with your intended audience.

• Use heading, subheadings, or other devices to signal what\'s coming
next. Labels for sections, headings, and subheading should be clear and
informative to the intended audience.

• Write in an active voice and in a conversational style. For example,
conversational style uses contractions (I\'d instead of I would) and
informal vocabulary (find out instead of determine).

> • Use a friendly and positive tone.

• Use words that are familiar to your intended audience. Shorter words
tend to be more common, and they are generally preferable. For example,
use doctor instead of physician. Pay back instead of reimburse. Can get
instead of eligible. There are exceptions. For example, access is a
short word, but it is health care jargon that is hard for many consumers
to understand. Organization is a five-syllable word, but is probably
familiar to most readers.

• When a term is best known to your intended audience by its acronym,
use the acronym and spell out the word that it represents in parenthesis
with the letters that form the acronym in bold. For example: PCP
(**P**rimary **C**are **P**rovider).

• Be on alert for words that are abstract or vague, or that may mean
different things to different people. Replace these words with more
specific words to be sure your readers understand the key messages.

• Keep your sentences simple and direct. Most should be reasonably
short; about eight to ten words per sentence for most sentences. When
sentences are long, the main point gets lost in all the words. Active
voice makes the style more direct.

• Vary the length of your sentences. Somewhat longer, natural-sounding
sentences of about 12 to 15 words can effectively break up the choppy
effect of using many short sentences.

• Paragraphs should be relatively short. Short paragraphs are more
inviting to your reader and give the visual appearance of being easier
to read.

• Use simpler words rather than technical terms whenever you can without
losing the content or distorting the meaning. Sometimes it\'s important
to use a technical term, such as the words mammogram, or cholesterol.

• Appearance should be appealing at first glance. Pages should be
uncluttered with generous margins and plenty of white space.

• The graphic design should use contrast, indentation, bullets, and
other devices to signal the main points and make the text easier to
skim.

> • Use a large type and spacing between lines.

**290.4 - Required Elements in Appeals Correspondence**\
**(Rev. 2926, Issued: 04-11-14, Effective: 07-14-14, Implementation:
07-14-14)**

The following should be used in all appeals correspondence:

> • The name of the beneficiary/provider/physician/supplier to whom the
> letter is addressed rather than "Dear Sir/Madam;\"
>
> • Correspondence is identified by either the date on written
> correspondence or the date the written correspondence was received;
>
> • The name of the provider, physician or supplier as well as the
> date(s) of service;
>
> • When appropriate, an explanation in letters to beneficiaries,
> explaining why he/she is being sent a letter if the appeal came from
> the provider, physician or other supplier;
>
> • The appeal determination/decision is placed in the beginning of the
> letter;
>
> • Explicit rationale that describes why the items or services at issue
> do not meet Medicare guidelines. Merely stating that an item or
> service is "not medically reasonable and necessary under §1862(a)(1)"
> or "not medically reasonable and necessary under Medicare guidelines"
> does not provide any rationale. The rationale should include a
> description of the logic that led to the decision, references used to
> support the decision, and other information that is relevant to
> support the decision in the case;
>
> • When the appeals correspondence includes Medicare statutory
> citations, they must be related to the decision in layman's terms. The
> statutory cite is listed as a parenthetical at the end of the
> sentence. For example, instead of beginning a sentence with, "§1879 of
> the Social Security Act states that\...," the sentence should start
> with "Under Medicare law, suppliers must\...(§1879 of the Social
> Security Act)";
>
> • Whenever the person is to receive some further response, such as an
> MSN (if available), an estimated time frame as to when he/she will
> receive it is provided;
>
> • Telephone number on all correspondence for additional questions;
>
> • What, if anything, must be done next, and by whom;
>
> • As appropriate, the results of any consultations with professional
> medical staff;
>
> • When applicable, a statement advising the appellant that upon
> written request the MAC will provide them copies of regulations,
> statutes, and guidelines used in making the determination;
>
> • For appeals, if the redetermination is partially or wholly
> favorable, an explanation about why the new determination is different
> from the previous determination; and
>
> • The correspondence must be written in a clear manner and with a
> customer- friendly tone.

**300 - Disclosure of Information**\
**(Rev. 1274, Issued: 06-29-07, Effective: 07-01-07, Implementation:
10-01-07)**

**300.1 - General Information**\
**(Rev. 3549, Issued: 06-24-16, Effective: 07-26-16, Implementation:
07-26-16)**

T for policy governing the disclosure and confidentiality of information
collected by the contractor is of the Act, the Department's Public
Information regulations, as well as the Privacy Act, and the Fr of
Information Act. In general, all information relating to an individual
is confidential except as provided by regulation. In the interest of an
appellant's right to dues, there are situations wheosed. The CMS
regulations implementing of the Act can be found at (See the Medicare
General Information, Ety, and Entitlement Manua

In addition, in title XI of the Act provides penalties for violation of
the provisions concerning confidentialnformation. Activities prohibited
under the provisions of the Act include, but are not limited to, making
false and fraudulent statements, fraudulent concealment of evidence
affecting payment benefits, false impersonation of another individual,
misuse or conversion of payments for use of another, and improper
disclosure of confidential information. (See the Medicare Program
Integrity Manual 100-08.)

**300.2 - Disclosure of Information to Third Parties**\
**(Rev. 1274, Issued: 06-29-07, Effective: 07-01-07, Implementation:
10-01-07)**

If a beneficiary wishes to have his/her information disclosed to a third
party without appointing that individual as a representative, this can
be accomplished by the beneficiary or third party providing written
authorization to the MAC for the release of the information. The written
authorization must contain a signature of the beneficiary and an
explanation of the type of information the beneficiary agrees to release
to the individual. An example of this type of situation is where a
beneficiary has asked a Member of Congress for assistance with his/her
appeal. In this case, it may be necessary for the Member of Congress to
receive the decision; however the Member of Congress does not wish to
accept the responsibility associated with being the beneficiary\'s
appointed representative or the beneficiary does not wish to appoint the
Member of Congress as his/her representative. See §310.1 for more
information on requests for redetermination submitted by Members of
Congress. If the beneficiary wishes to appoint a representative, MACs
should refer to §270.

**300.3 - Fraud and Abuse Investigations**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

Any and all evidence used by the A/B MAC (A), (B), (HHH), or DME MAC to
arrive at a determination or decision shall be placed in the appeals
case file (copies are acceptable). Information in the case file shall be
made available to an appellant upon request. Therefore, the MAC shall be
aware that information placed in the case file is accessible to an
appellant. The UPIC shall also understand that the MAC may not consider
any evidence that has not been made a part of the case file. The UPIC
and the MAC shall therefore exercise discretion when deciding whether to
place any of the following information into the appeals case file:

> • The impetus behind a fraud and abuse investigation;
>
> • The name of the beneficiary or any other person lodging the
> complaint that triggers the fraud and abuse investigation;
>
> • Notes or transcripts of beneficiary interviews resulting from a
> fraud and abuse investigation;
>
> • Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes during
> a fraud and abuse investigation; or
>
> • The name of a confidential source(s) when confidentiality has been
> promised by CMS in return for cooperation in a fraud and abuse
> investigation.

Where the MAC relies upon any of the above information in order to deny
a claim or to render a less than fully favorable determination or
decision, then an appellant has a due process right to review this\
information. If information is kept out of an appeals case file for
confidentiality reasons, it may not be relied upon to make a coverage
decision or deny or reduce payment.

**300.4 - Medical Consultants Used**\
**(Rev. 1274, Issued: 06-29-07, Effective: 07-01-07, Implementation:
10-01-07)**

The parties are entitled to know the identity and qualifications of any
consultant whose evidence the MAC used to support the initial claim
determination or the redetermination. If the MAC uses a consultant, it
shall include the identity and qualifications of the consultant in the
file for possible use by the ALJ, and for the appellant's use upon
request. This applies to both external medical consultants and internal
staff used to review the claim. An example of this would be the name and
title of the medical consultant.

**300.5 - Appeal Decision Involving Multiple Beneficiaries**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

**A. Appeals of Overpayments Involving Multiple Beneficiaries with a
Single Account Receivable**

If an appellant submits a request for redetermination that involves an
overpayment with a single account receivable for claims involving
multiple beneficiaries, the MAC shall issue one decision letter to the
appellant that includes information specific to the claims for each
beneficiary. The summary of facts, coverage, payment and liability
decisions for each beneficiary's claim(s) may be included as a separate
attachment to the decision letter. Since each beneficiary is a party to
the appeal, subject to the exception in §300.5.C below, the MAC shall
send each beneficiary a copy of their own determination without
compromising the privacy of other beneficiaries in the appeal. (Refer to
IOM, 100-06, Medicare Financial Management Manual, Chapter 6, section
460.1, for instructions on how to count requests that involve multiple
beneficiaries).

**B. Appeals Involving Claims of Multiple Beneficiaries, Other than
Overpayments with a Single Account Receivable**

If a party files a request for redetermination that involves claims of
multiple beneficiaries that do not comprise an overpayment with a single
account receivable, the MAC may process the appeal by issuing a

separate decision letter for each beneficiary\'s claim(s) (i.e., as a
split appeal), or the MAC may issue a single letter with attachments for
each separate claim, whichever is more efficient.

Example: If a supplier submits a single appeal request involving
unrelated claims for various beneficiaries that were denied on
prepayment review or through prepayment edits, the MAC may process the
appeal as a split and issue separate letters to the supplier-appellant,
or the MAC may issue a single letter with attachments for each claim. In
either case, the beneficiary, as a party to the appeal, must receive a
copy of the decision letter that pertains to his or her claims.

Example: If a supplier submits a single appeal request involving claims
reviewed by a recovery auditor on a postpayment basis, resulting in
overpayments (not extrapolated) processed as separate accounts
receivable, the MAC may issue either a single decision letter to the
appellant with attachments for each claim, or separate decision letters,
whichever is more efficient. The beneficiary, as a party to the appeal,
must receive a copy of the decision letter that pertains to his or her
claims, subject to the exception noted in §300.5.C below.

**C. Exception to Sending Decision Letters to Beneficiaries in
Overpayment Cases**

In an overpayment case involving multiple beneficiaries who have no
financial liability prior to, and following the redetermination, the MAC
mails the decision letter to the appellant or their appointed
representative. In this situation, Mo send the decision letters to
beneficiaries who are parties to the redetermination (see . However, if
financial liability shifts from the provider or supplier to the benefic
separate decision letter to the beneficiary that explains why he/she is
liable, and explains the subsequent appeal rights available.

Example: During a postpayment review, claims for multiple beneficiaries
are initialled as being not medically reasonable and necessary, and the
determination of liability under section of the Act finds the physician
financially responsible for the denied services. If during the appeal,
thician demonstrates that a valid ABN was issued for some of the
services provided to certain beneficiaries and financial responsibility
shifts from the physician to those beneficiaries, the MAC must issue
separate decision letters to the affected beneficiaries, but is not
required to issue separate decision letters to those beneficiaries whose
liability has not changed (i.e., liability remains with the physician).

**310 - Redetermination - The First Level of Appeal**\
**(Rev. 2729, Issued: 06-21-13, Effective: 07-23-13, Implementation:
07-23-13)**

A party dissatisfied with an initial determination may request that the
MAC review its determination. A redetermination is the first level of
appeal after the initial determination on Part A and Part B claims. It
is a second look at the claim and supporting documentation and is made
by an employee that did not take part in the initial determination. If
an initial determination is not made, there are no appeal rights on that
claim (see §200.C for a list of actions that are not initial
determinations and therefore do not have appeal rights).

The reviewer must comply with, and is bound by, all applicable statutory
and regulatory provisions. The reviewer may not overrule the provisions
of the law or interpret them in a way different than CMS; nor may the
reviewer comment upon the legality, constitutional or otherwise, of any
provision of the Act, regulations, or CMS policy in the review
determination. The reviewer is also bound by all CMS-issued policies and
procedures, including CMS rulings, Medicare manual instructions, change
requests, national coverage determinations, and local coverage
determinations. The reviewer must consider the applicability of all
CMS-issued policies and procedures to the facts of a given claim. The
reviewer may not change the amount required to be paid under the
Physician Fee Schedule.

**310.1 - Filing a Request for Redetermination**\
***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:
10- 01-19)***

A request for redetermination must be filed with the contractor in
writing. The request may be made by a party to the appeal as defined in
§260 and/or the party's representative as defined in §270. Appeal
requests submitted electronically via a facsimile or secure Internet
portal/application shall be considered to have been received in writing.

**NOTE**: Contractors are not required to utilize a facsimile and/or a
secure Internet portal/application for performing appeals activities.
Contractors may not require an appellant to file an appeal
electronically (e.g., via facsimile and/or a secure Internet
portal/application). Submission of appeal requests via facsimile or a
portal/application shall be at the discretion of the appellant.
Contractors shall continue to accept appeal requests in hardcopy via
mail.

**A. Written Redetermination Requests Filed on Behalf of the
Beneficiary**

Someone other than an appointed representative may submit a written
request for redetermination on behalf of a beneficiary. Persons who
often act on behalf of a beneficiary in filing a redetermination request
include: the spouse, parent, child, sibling, neighbor or friend.
Beneficiary advocacy groups and Members of Congress may also submit a
request for redetermination on behalf of a beneficiary (see §310.1.A.1
for further discussion on requests submitted by Members of Congress).

The contractor honors the request for redetermination if the request
clearly shows the beneficiary knew of or approved the submission of the
request for redetermination (e.g., the request is submitted with a
written authorization from the beneficiary or with the beneficiary's
MSN). However, if the contractor has information that the
redetermination request was not submitted at the request of the
beneficiary, the contractor does not conduct the redetermination unless
and/or until it receives confirmation from the beneficiary that the
request was submitted with the beneficiary's approval.

If a redetermination request is submitted by an individual who is not
the beneficiary's appointed\
representative, all written notices related to the appeal are sent only
to the beneficiary, not the individual making the request for
redetermination. In addition, if the contractor honors a request for
redetermination filed by someone other than the beneficiary or the
beneficiary's appointed representative, the contractor should contact
the beneficiary (or an appointed/authorized representative if
applicable) if further information is needed to process the
redetermination.

**NOTE:** An authorized representative is an individual authorized under
State or other applicable law to act on behalf of a beneficiary in an
appeal, and has all of the rights and responsibilities of a beneficiary
with respect to the appeal. An authorized representative does not need
to secure an appointment of representative from the beneficiary in order
to file an appeal or obtain/receive information related to the appeal.
See §270.1.1 for additional information regarding authorized
representatives.

The person submitting the request does not automatically become the
representative until and unless an appointment of representative form or
other written statement is completed (see §270 for instructions on
developing an incomplete or absent appointment of representative).

There will be circumstances where the mental and/or physical incapacity
of the beneficiary becomes an issue. Based on all the documented medical
information available, the contractor may decide to allow the person
submitting the request for redetermination to act on behalf of a
beneficiary who is mentally or physically incapacitated. The
contractor's decision, as well as the beneficiary's incapacitation,
should be documented in the file and supported by relevant medical
documentation.

**1. Requests for Redetermination Submitted by Members of Congress**

When the contractor has honored a request for redetermination filed by a
Member of Congress pursuant to a Congressional inquiry made on behalf of
a beneficiary or provider, physician or other supplier, the contractor
may continue to provide theMember of Congress with status information on
the appeal at issue.

Status information includes the progression of the appeal through the
administrative appeals process, including information on whether or when
an appeal determination or decision has been issued and what the
decision was (e.g., favorable, unfavorable, partially favorable), but
does not include release of personal information about a beneficiary
that the Member of Congress did not already have in his/her possession.
A beneficiary may want a Member of Congress to obtain more detailed
information about his/her appeal without appointing the Member of
Congress as a representative. In this case, it would be necessary for
the beneficiary to sign a release of information. The contractor must
accept any of the following as releases of information:

> •A signed copy of correspondence from the beneficiary expressing a
> desire for the congressional office to obtain information on his/her
> behalf;
>
> •A release of information form developed by the congressional office;
> or
>
> •A release of information form developed by the contractor for this
> purpose.

If the Member of Congress expresses an interest in acting as the
representative of a beneficiary or of a provider, physician, or other
supplier, the party must complete an appointment of representative form
or written statement.

**B. What Constitutes a Request for Redetermination**

**1. Written Requests for Redetermination Made by Beneficiaries**

Beneficiaries may request a redetermination by submitting a copy of
their MSN, by filing a completed Form CMS-20027 or by submitting a
letter that indicates dissatisfaction with a claim determination. As
noted above, appeal requests received via a facsimile or secure Internet
portal/application shall also be considered received in writing.
Requests for redetermination may be submitted in situations where
beneficiaries assume that they will receive a redetermination by
questioning a payment detail of the determination or by sending
additional information back with the MSN, but don't actually say: I want
a review. For example, a written inquiry stating, "Why did you only pay
\$10.00?" is considered a request for redetermination. Common examples
of phrasing in letters from beneficiaries that constitute requests for
redetermination include, but are not limited to the following:

> • "Please reconsider my claim."
>
> • "I am not satisfied with the amount paid - please look at it again."
>
> • "My neighbor got paid for the same kind of claim. My claim should be
> paid too."

The request may contain the word appeal or review. There may be
instances in which the word review is used but where the clear intent of
the request is for a status report. This should be considered an
inquiry.

**2. Written Requests for Redetermination Submitted by a State,
Provider, Physician or Other Supplier**

States, providers, physicians, or other suppliers with appeal rights
must submit written requests via mail, facsimile or secure Internet
portal/application (if the contractor chooses to receive requests via
facsimile or CMS approved secure Internetportal/application) indicating
what they are appealing and why. A redetermination request may be
submitted using:

> **a. A completed Form CMS-20027 constitutes a request for
> redetermination.** "Completed" means that all applicable spaces are
> filled out and all necessary attachments are included with the
> request.
>
> **b. A written request/letter.** At a minimum, the request must
> contain the following information:
>
> 1\. Beneficiary name;\
> 2. Medicare number;\
> 3. The specific service(s) and/or item(s) for which the
> redetermination is being requested; 4. The specific date(s) of the
> service; and\
> *5.*The name of the party or the representative of the party*.*

Frequently, a party will write to a contractor concerning the initial
determination instead of filing Form CMS-20027. How to handle such
letters depends upon their content and/or wording. A letter serves as a
request for redetermination if it contains the information listed above
and either: (1) explicitly asks the contractor to take further action,
or (2) indicates dissatisfaction with the contractor's decision. The
contractor counts the receipt and processing of the letter as an appeal
only if it treats it as a request for redetermination.

**NOTE**: The details of its actions must be detailed (e.g., when action
was taken and what was done) for possible subsequent evidentiary and
administrative purposes.

> **c. A secure Internet portal/application.** If a contractor has
> received CMS approval for the use of a secure Internet
> portal/application to support appeals activities, appellants may (but
> are not required to) submit redetermination requests via the secure
> Internet portal/application. Written requests submitted via the
> portal/application shall include the required elements for a valid
> appeal request as outlined above under §310.1.B.2.b.

**NOTE:** Some redetermination requests may contain attachments. For
example, if the RA is attached to the redetermination request that does
not contain the dates of service on the cover and the dates of service
are highlighted or emphasized in some manner on the attached RA, this is
an acceptable redetermination request.

Where the required information is not listed on the request form but is
provided within the documents or atted with the appeal, the request
substantiequirements established in MACs shall not dismiss requests
under when redeterminations suy with requirements.

***3*. How to Handle Incomplete Requests for Redetermination:**

If any of the above information referenced in Section 2 is not included
with an appeal request submitted by a party or their representative
(other than a beneficiary, or a beneficiary's representative), the
request is considered incomplete and the contractor issues a dismissal
notice with an explanation of the information that must be included (see
§310.6 for more information on dismissals). Contractors should not
consider beneficiary requests as incomplete, whether filed by the
beneficiary or by their representative. Contractors must contact
beneficiaries (or their representatives), when necessary, to obtain
missing information needed to process the redetermination.

***4*. How to Handle Multiple Requests for Redetermination for the Same
Item/Service:**

> **a. Duplicate requests (multiple requests from same party) while an
> appeal is pending.** If an appeal for an item or service is pending
> and the appellant submits a duplicate request for redetermination, the
> contractor combines the requests into one redetermination. The
> contractor shall include verbiage indicating that duplicate requests
> for redetermination had been received (on what dates and via what
> venues, if multiple venues were utilized). Adjudication time frames
> are still based on the first request
>
> for redetermination. NOTE: See 310.4.D.4 for extending adjudication
> timeframes if additional information is submitted with the second
> appeal request.
>
> If the contractor identifies a pattern in which an appellant or groups
> of appellants are repeatedly submitting duplicate requests for
> redetermination, the contractor shall take additional steps to educate
> the appellant regarding the appeals process.
>
> **b. Multiple requests from different parties while an appeal is
> pending.** If an appeal for an item or service is pending and another
> party to the redetermination submits a request for redetermination,
> the contractor shall combine the red and issue a decision within 60
> days of the latest filed request, in accordance with
>
> When issuing the decision or dismissal notice, the contractor shall
> include verbiage indicating that requests for redetermination had been
> received from multiple parties (on what dates and via what venues, if
> multiple venues were utilizhe parties that the decision or dismissal
> was issued timely in accordance with
>
> **c. Duplicate or multiple requests when an appeal is complete.** If a
> decision or dismissal notice has been issued (including an MSN or RA
> for a fully favorable decision), and the contractor receives an
> additional request for redetermination for that item/service (a
> duplicate request from the appellant or a subsequent request from a
> different party), the contractor shall treat the additional request as
> an inquiry. The contractor directs the party to file a request for
> reconsideration with the appropriate QIC.
>
> **d**. **Workload -**Whenever the contractor combines duplicate or
> multiple requests for redetermination as explained above, the
> contractor shall ensure that the workload reporting reflects one
> redetermination receipt and one redetermination completed.

**NOTE:** If a party files a request for reconsiderationwith the
contractor after a redetermination decision or dismissal notice has been
issued, the contractor treats the reconsideration request as misfiled
and forwards the request to the QIC for a reconsideration in accordance
with §320.1.B.

Contractors **shall not** issue a dismissal notice in response to a
duplicate request or multiple requests for redetermination.

**NOTE:** In accordance with IOM 100-04, chapter 29, section 310.6.3, if
an appellant requests that the contractor vacate its dismissal action,
or an appellant refiles a corrected appeal in response to a dismissal,
and the contractor determines that it cannot vacate the dismissal, then
it sends a letter notifying the appellant accordingly. If evidence or
information not previously submitted with the redetermination request is
submitted with the request to vacate the dismissal, the letter must
specifically address that new evidence or information. The contractor
shall not issue a second dismissal notice to the appellant.

***5*. Letters and Calls That Are Considered Inquiries**

See IOM 100-09, Medicare Contractor Beneficiary and Provider
Communications Manual. The contractor considers the letter or telephone
call an inquiry (i.e., not an appeal request) if:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| •                                 | > It is clearly limited to a      |
|                                   | > request for an explanation of   |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Parties to a claim must file a request for redetermination with the
proper contractor based on the claims processing jurisdiction rules
established by the Medicare program. Jurisdiction is established based
on either the State where the service was provided (for Part B claims
**not** involving DME), the State where the beneficiary resides (for
Part B DME claims only), or the location of the A/B MAC (for Part A
provider claims). There may be instances where requests for
redetermination are directed to the wrong contractor. Contractors shall
have standard operational procedures, including maintaining a record of
these cases, in place to ensure that misfiled requests are forwarded to
the proper contractor jurisdiction within 60 calendar days of receipt.

Refer to § 310.4.A for information on determining whether misfiled
requests for appeal are processed in a timely manner.

**310.2 - Time Limit for Filing a Request for Redetermination (Rev.
4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation: 06-13-19)**

A party must file a redetermination request within 120 days of the date
of receipt of the notice of initial determination (MSN or RA) with the
contractor indicated on the notice of initial determination (receipt of
the notice of initial determination is presumed to be 5 days after the
date of the MSN or RA unless there is evidence to the contrary). The
date of filing for requests filed in writing is defined as the date
received by the appropriate contractor in the corporate mailroom, the
date received via facsimile, or the date received in the secure Internet
portal/application, as evidenced by the receiving office's date stamp on
the request. If the party has filed the request in person with the
contractor, the filing date is the date of filing at such office, as
evidenced by the receiving office's date stamp on the request. If the
party has mailed or filed in person the request for redetermination to a
CMS, SSA, RRB office, or another contractor or Government agency

within the time limit, and the request did not reach the appropriate
contractor until after the time period to file a request expired, the
contractorshall consider the date the request was first filed with a
contractor or an official Federal government entity as the date of
receipt for purposes of determining if the redetermination request was
filed in a timely manner**.**

When the filing deadline for a redetermination ends on a Saturday,
Sunday, legal holiday, or any other nonwork day, the contractor shall
apply a rollover period that extends the filing deadline to the first
working day after the Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or other nonwork
day. For example, if the filing deadline for a redetermination falls on
the Saturday before Columbus Day, the filing deadline is extended to the
first working day after the Columbus Day holiday.

The contractor may extend the period for filing if it finds the party
had good cause for not requesting the redetermination timely. (See
§240.2 for a discussion of good cause.) In order for good cause to be
considered, the appeal request must be in writing, received via hard
copy mail, through a facsimile, or through a secure Internet
portal/application. If the contractor finds that the party did not have
good cause for failing to request a redetermination in a timely manner,
it may, at its discretion, consider reopening. (See Pub. 100-04, chapter
34.)

**310.3 - Reporting Redetermination on the Appeals Report (Rev. 2729,
Issued: 06-21-13, Effective: 07-23-13, Implementation: 07-23-13)**

The MAC is required to report all appeals related data and information
on the CMS Appeals Report. The Report is intended to capture information
on appeal requests, including other correspondence that is determined to
be a request for redetermination. Correspondence that initially appears
to be an inquiry, but is determined to be an appeal request, must be
reported as a redetermination receipt and not an inquiry.

**310.4 - The Redetermination**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

**A. Timely Processing Requirements**

The contractor must complete and mail a redetermination notice for all
requests for redetermination within 60 days of receipt of the request
(with the exception of (D)(4) below). The date of receipt for purposes
of this standard is defined as the date the request for redetermination
is received in the corporate mailroom or the date when the electronic
request for appeal is received via facsimile or through the secure
Internet portal/application. For misfiled redetermination requests, the
proper contractor jurisdiction must complete and mail a redetermination
notice within 60 days of receiving the misfiled request in their
corporate mailroom.

Completion means:

> 1.For affirmations (unfavorable decisions), the date the decision
> letter is mailed to all of the parties (or their representatives).
> Affirmations processed via a CMS approved secure Internet\
> portal/application shall be considered complete on the date the
> electronic redetermination notice is transmitted to the appellant
> through the secure Internet portal/application, and a hard copy
> decision letter is sent to other parties to the appeal who do not have
> access to the secure Internet\
> portal/application. See §310.10 for additional requirements related to
> notices sent via secure portal/applications.
>
> 2.For partial reversals (partially favorable decisions) and full
> reversals (fully favorable decisions), when all of the following
> actions have been completed:
>
> a\. The decision letter, if applicable, is mailed to the parties. If
> the redetermination is processed via a CMS approved secure Internet
> portal/application, it shall be considered complete on the date the
> electronic redetermination notice is transmitted to the appellant
> through the secure Internet
>
> portal/application, and a hard copy decision letter is sent to other
> parties to the appeal who do not have access to the secure Internet
> portal/application. See §310.10 for additional requirements related to
> notices sent via secure portal/ applications, and
>
> b\. The actions to initiate the adjustment action in the claims
> processing system are taken. When the adjustment action is completed,
> this action must be included on the next scheduled release of the
> MSN/RA. Appropriate follow-up action should be taken to ensure that
> the adjustment action results in the issuance of proper payment.
>
> 3.For withdrawals and dismissals, the date the dismissal notice is
> mailed. If the redetermination is processed via a CMS approved secure
> Internet portal/application, it shall be considered complete on the
> date the notice is transmitted to the appellant through the secure
> Internet portal/application, and a hard copy decision letter is sent
> to other parties to the appeal who do not have access to the secure
> Internet portal/application. See §310.10 for additional requirements
> related to notices sent via secure portal/applications.

**B. Development of the Appeal Case File**

The reviewer must obtain and review all available and relevant
information needed to make the\
determination. All information considered by the appeals adjudicator in
conducting the redetermination must be included in the case file. Other
areas within the contractor may have information relevant to the
claim(s) at issue. For example, the medical review area may submit
evidence to the reviewer for inclusion in the case file (e.g.,
documentation and correspondence related to provider education on the
issues appealed, any notices of review, and specific documentation
requests to the provider and third parties).

In addition, contractors such as Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs),
UPICs, or the Supplemental Medical Review Contractor (SMRC) may have
other information from their review of claims that they wish to include
in the case file. Documentation submitted by a provider, supplier or
beneficiary (or other party to the appeal) as part of a prepayment (e.g.
medical review or demand bill review) or postpayment (e.g. UPIC reviews)
review, including clinical documentation, must be included in the
appeals case file for\
consideration during the redetermination.

If this documentation is not included in the appeals case file, the
reviewer shall request the documentation from the claims review
contractors (i.e., RACs, UPICs, and SMRCs) prior to rendering the
redetermination decision. The timeframes associated with request and
delivery of medical records from the CMS claims review contractor to the
MAC should be agreed upon in the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA). The
MACs should notify the respective Contracting Officer's Representative
if there is any difficulty obtaining documentation from the CMS
contractors within the agreed upon timeframes established by the JOA.

If the claims review contractor confirms that it did not receive medical
records from the provider, supplier, or beneficiary (or other party to
the appeal) or the information is otherwise unavailable, and the\
documentation is needed to support a favorable resolution of the appeals
case, then the MAC shall reach out to the provider, supplier,
beneficiary (or other proper party to the appeal) to obtain the medical
records, and any other supporting documentation, prior to rendering the
redetermination decision. The case file and redetermination decision
letter shall document all attempts to obtain the medical records and/or
any other support documentation prior to rendering the redetermination
decision.

The development of the case file is important not only for the
redetermination, but also to prepare for a potential appeal to the QIC.
Proper development of the case file will assist the contractor in timely
transmitting the case file to the QIC upon request. In instances of
large overpayment cases involving many claims, this case file
development is extremely important.

For example, with respect to overpayments that are determined through
statistical sampling and extrapolation, appellants often challenge the
sampling methodology and the extrapolation during the reconsideration or
an ALJ hearing. To avoid any documentation issues during subsequent
appeals,

contractors shall include all information detailed in IOM 100-08,
Chapter 8, §8.4.4 related to the sampling methodology and extrapolation
in the case file.

When a reconsideration request is filed with the QIC, and the QIC
requests a case file for a large\
overpayment case, it is critical the QIC obtain the case file timely so
it can begin adjudication. Therefore, it should be a priority for the
contractor to adequately develop case files.

Evidence in the case file must be made available for inspection by an
appellant or party upon request. Reviewers must exercise care in
determining the weight to give allegations of fraud and abuse where the
source of the specified information is not provided. Although the name
of the beneficiary or other source that provided the information that
triggered an investigation is not always provided or necessary when
reviewing the evidence, the case file must include information on the
independent, subsequently developed investigation that supports the
claim decision (See subsection D, below, for instructions on development
of documentation.)

**C. Conducting the Redetermination**

> **1. Overview**
>
> • The redetermination is an independent review of an initial
> determination. The individual performing the redetermination must not
> be the same person who made the initial determination.
>
> • The contractor reviews the evidence and findings upon which the
> initial determination was based, and any additional evidence the
> parties submit or the contractor obtains on its own.
>
> • For redeterminations of claims denied following a complex prepayment
> review, a complex post-payment review, or an automated post-payment
> review by a contractor, MACs shall limit their review to the reason(s)
> the claim or line item at issue was initially denied. Prepayment
> reviews occur prior to Medicare payment, when a contractor conducts a
> review of the claim and/or supporting documentation to make an initial
> determination. Post-payment review or audit refers to claims that were
> initially paid by Medicare and subsequently reopened and reviewed by,
> for example, a UPIC, RAC, MAC, or Comprehensive Error Rate Testing
> (CERT) contractor, and revised to deny coverage, change coding, or
> reduce payment. Complex reviews require a manual review of the
> supporting medical records to determine whether there is an improper
> payment.
>
> Automated reviews use claims data analysis to identify improper
> payments. If an appeal involves a claim or line item denied on an
> automated pre-payment basis, MACs may continue to develop new issues
> and evidence at their discretion and may issue unfavorable decisions
> for reasons other than those specified in the initial determination.
>
> Contractors will continue to follow existing procedures regarding
> claim adjustments resulting from favorable appeal decisions. These
> adjustments will process through CMS systems and may suspend due to
> system edits. Claim adjustments that do not process to payment because
> of additional system imposed payment limitations, conditions or
> restrictions (for example, frequency limits or National Correct Coding
> Initiative edits) may result in new denials with full appeal rights
> (i.e., the new denial will be considered an initial determination with
> respect to the appeals process).
>
> If a MAC conducts an appeal of a claim or line item that was denied on
> pre- or post-payment review because a provider, supplier, or
> beneficiary failed to submit requested documentation, the MAC will
> review all applicable coverage and payment requirements for the item
> or service at issue, including whether the item or service was
> medically reasonable and necessary. As a result, claims initially
> denied for insufficient documentation may be denied on appeal if
> additional documentation is submitted and it does not support medical
> necessity.
>
> • There may be times where the appellant requests a redetermination of
> an entire claim and there may be times where he/she requests a
> redetermination of a specific line item on the claim. The contractor
> should review all aspects of the claim or line item necessary to
> respond to the appellant's issue. For example, if the appellant
> questions the amount paid, the contractor must also review medical
> necessity, coverage, deductible, and limitation on liability, if
> applicable.
>
> • If the appellant requests a redetermination of a specific line item,
> the contractor reviews all aspects of the claim related to that line
> item. If appropriate, it reviews the entire claim. If it reviews more
> than what the appellant indicated, it includes an explanation in the
> rationale portion of the\
> redetermination letter of why the other service(s)/item(s) were
> reviewed.

**2. \[Reserved\]**

**3. Appeal Requests Filed on Resubmitted Claims**

For appeals of a specific line item or service, the date of the first
MSN or RA that states the coverage and payment decision is the date of
the initial determination. Adjustments to the initial claim or claim
resubmissions for the same item/service on the same date of service that
are included on subsequent MSNs or RAs, but do not revise the initial
determination, do not extend/change the appeal rights on the initial
determination.

**4. Fraud**

Although the reviewer may not make a finding of criminal or civil fraud
(see §280, "Fraud and Abuse"), the reviewer should review the claim to
see if there is sufficient documentation and evidence supporting that
the items or services were actually furnished or were furnished as
billed.

**5. Appeals Involving Overpayments**

For appeals that involve overpayments, the contractor shall review all
aspects of the overpayment, including the validity of the overpayment,
whether the amount of the overpayment was correctly calculated and
extrapolated (if applicable), who is responsible for the overpayment,
and whether recovery of the\
overpayment should be waived under §1870 of the Act. For additional
information see IOM 100-06 Chapter 3, sections 70 through 110.

If the redetermination involves an extrapolated overpayment and the
appellant challenges the validity of the sampling methodology, the
contractor reviews the claims in question as well as the methodology
used to extrapolate the overpayment amount. For background on how the
UPICs use statistical sampling to estimate overpayments, see IOM 100-08,
Chapter 8, section 8.4. If a reconsideration is subsequently requested,
the entire case will be sent.

**6. Evidence**

Appellants have the opportunity to submit written evidence and arguments
relating to the claim at issue. Contractors must accept and consider any
relevant documentation submitted. Contractors may also accept this
information via facsimile and/or a secure Internet portal/application.

**D. Requests for Documentation**

**1.Requesting Documentation for State-Initiated Appeals**

The reviewer should not request documentation directly from a provider
or supplier for a State- initiated appeal. If additional documentation
is needed, the reviewer should request that the submitter of the appeal
(i.e., the State or the party authorized to act on behalf of the
Medicaid State Agency) obtain and submit necessary documentation. The
requested documents may be submitted via facsimile or via a secure
Internet

portal/application. Documentation previously submitted by the State or
the provider/supplier as part of a demand bill review must be included
in the appeals case file for review during the redetermination (see
§310.4.B).

**2. Requesting Documentation for Provider or Supplier-Initiated
Appeals**

For provider and supplier initiated appeals, when necessary
documentation has not been submitted, the reviewer advises the provider
or supplier to submit the required documentation. The reviewer notifies
the provider or supplier of the timeframe the provider or supplier has
to submit the documentation. The reviewer documents the request in the
redetermination case file. The requested documents may be submitted via
facsimile and/or via a secure Internet portal/application. In some
situations, a provider or supplier may inform the reviewer that it is
having trouble obtaining supporting documentation from another provider
or supplier (e.g., an ambulance supplier who is requested to submit
hospital admission records). In this situation, the contractor may
assist the provider or supplier in obtaining records. If the additional
documentation that was requested is not received within 14 calendar days
from the date of request, the reviewer conducts the redetermination
based on the information in the file. The reviewer must consider
evidence that is received after the 14-day deadline but before having
made and issued the redetermination.

See §310.4.D.4 below for information on the extension of the decision
making timeframe for additional documentation that is submitted after
the request.

**3. Requesting Documentation for Beneficiary-Initiated Appeals**

For beneficiary initiated appeals, when necessary documentation has not
been submitted, the reviewer advises the provider or supplier to submit
the required documentation. The reviewer documents the request in the
redetermination case file. The reviewer notifies the beneficiary (either
in writing or via a telephone call) when the reviewer has asked the
beneficiary's provider or supplier for additional documentation. The
reviewer also notifies the beneficiary that the provider or supplier has
14 calendar days to submit the additional documentation that has been
requested, and that if the documentation is not submitted, the reviewer
will decide based on the evidence in the case file. If the reviewer
sends the beneficiary a letter, it must include a description of the
documentation that has been requested. The reviewer shall document all
notifications and correspondence to and from the beneficiary in the
redetermination case file.

**4. Extension for Receipt of Additional Documentation**

Contractors shall educate parties to include all supporting
documentation with the redetermination requests submitted via mail,
facsimile or a secure Internet portal/application. However, when a party
submits additional evidence (via mail, facsimile or a secure Internet
portal/application) after filing the request for redetermination, the
contractor's 60-day decision- making timeframe is automatically extended
for up to 14 calendar days for each submission.

This additional time is allowed for all documentation submitted by a
party after the request, even when the documentation was requested by
the contractor. Although this extension is granted to the contractor for
making decisions, it should not routinely be applied unless extra time
is needed to consider the additional documentation.

**5. General Information**

The contractor routinely includes instructions on the appropriate
information to submit with appeal requests in its provider newsletters
and other educational literature. Providers and suppliers are
responsible for providing all the information the contractor requires to
adjudicate the claim(s) at issue.

**310.5 - The Redetermination Decision**\
**(Rev. 3549, Issued: 06-24-16, Effective: 07-26-16, Implementation:
07-26-16)**

**A. Redetermination Decision Letters**

The law requires contractors to conclude and mail and/or otherwise
transmit the redetermination decision within 60 days of receipt of the
appellant\'s request, as indicated in §310.4. For unfavorable\
redeterminations, the contractor mails the decision letter to the
appellant, and mails copies to each party to the initial determination
(or the party's authorized representative and/or appointed
representative, if applicable).

Contractors shall mail the written decision unless the contractor has
received approval from CMS to use a secure Internet portal/application
as part of the appeals process and the appellant has submitted the
request for appeal electronically. Contractors may transmit appeal
decisions (favorable, partially favorable, or unfavorable) via a secure
Internet portal/application if the appeal request was received via that
mechanism. Contractors shall ensure that a hard copy decision letter is
sent to other parties to the appeal who do not have access to the secure
Internet portal/application. See §310.10 for additional requirements
related to notices sent via secure portal/ applications.

For partially favorable redeterminations, the contractor mails and/or
otherwise transmits the decision letter, and an adjusted MSN or RA to
the appellant. The contractor mails a copy of the decision letter and
mails or otherwise transmits an adjusted MSN or RA to each party to the
initial determination (or the party's authorized representative, if
applicable). The contractor shall ensure that the appropriate MSN or RA
messages are included regarding refunds of payments, including when
necessary any coinsurance or deductible collected.

If a party has an appointed representative, the contractor mails the
decision letter to the appointed representative (see §270). Sending the
decision letter to the appointed representative has the same force and
effect as if the letter was sent to the party. The contractor does not
send an MSN or RA to an appointed representative.

For fully favorable redeterminations, the contractor mails or otherwise
transmits an MSN or RA reflecting the adjustment action to each party
(or the party's authorized representative, if applicable) on the next
scheduled release. The MSN provides the beneficiary with information as
to his/her financial liability with regard to the claim(s) that are now
payable (e.g. applicable coinsurance). The contractor does not send an
MSN or RA to an appointed representative.

Unless otherwise specified in its statement of work, contractors are not
required to send a fully favorable letter to parties until further
notice, except in those situations where the parties will not receive
notice of effectuation via an MSN or RA (e.g., MSP overpayments, non-MSP
overpayments which do not result in a refund or payment, etc.). In these
cases, the contractor mails and/or otherwise transmits via secure
Internet portal/application a notice to such parties or
authorized/appointed representative if applicable, that references the
claims appealed, and briefly explains the outcome of the
redetermination.

**B. Determinations That Result in Refunds to a Beneficiary**

If, as the result of a denial, a provider or supplier is required to
make a refund to a beneficiary for amounts collected from the
beneficiary for the items or services at issue, then the contractor must
include the following language in the redetermination:

"Therefore, you (the beneficiary) are not responsible for the charges
billed by (provider\'s name) except for any charges for services never
covered by Medicare. If you (the beneficiary) have paid (provider\'s
name) for these services (including payment of co- insurance and
deductible), you may be entitled to a refund. To get this refund, please
contact this office and send the following items:

> • A copy of this notice,\
> • The bill you received for the services, and\
> • The payment receipt, your cancelled check, or any other evidence
> showing that you have already paid (provider\'s name) for the services
> at issue.

You should file your written request for refund within 6 months of the
date of this notice."

If, as the result of a denial, a provider or supplier is required to
make a refund to a beneficiary for amounts collected from the
beneficiary for the items or services at issue, then the contractor must
send a copy of the adjusted RA in the following situations:

> 1\. A nonparticipating phyepting assignment who, based on the
> redetermination, now has a refund obligation under of the Act;
>
> 2\. A nonpartiier not accepting assigd nd obligation pursuant to due
> to a denial under or of the Act; or,
>
> 3\. A denial based on he Act of an assigned claim submitted by a
> supplier, where it is determined under of the Act that the supplier
> must refund any payments (including deductibles and clected from the
> beneficiary.

**NOTE:** For additional information regarding refund requirements,
please refer to IOM 100-04 Chapter 30, sections 140 and 150.

**C. Paid Claim Appeals**

If a contractor receives a valid appeal request on a claim that was
processed and paid subsequent to the filing of that appeal but prior to
issuance of the Medicare Redetermination Notice, the contractor shall
issue an unfavorable decision letter using the following template or
something similar to the appellant:

**310.6 - Dismissals**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

**A.Contractor Dismissal of a Redetermination Request**\
The contractor may dismiss a request for a redetermination under the
following circumstances:

> 1.Request of a Party - A request for redetermination may be withdrawn
> at any time prior to the mailing or transmission of the decision via a
> secure Internet portal/application upon the request of the party or
> parties filing the request for redetermination. A party may request a
> dismissal by filing a written notice of such request with the
> contractor. Contractors may accept requests for withdrawal via
> facsimile and/or a secure Internet portal/application, if approved by
> CMS. The dismissal of a request for redetermination is binding unless
> vacated by the contractor or QIC.
>
> 2.Dismissal for Cause - The contractor may dismiss a redetermination
> request, either entirely or as to any stated issue, under either of
> the following circumstances:

*a)*Where the party requesting a redetermination is not a proper party,
or

> *b)*Where the party requesting a redetermination does not otherwise
> have a right to a redetermination.
>
> 3.Failure to File Timely - When a request for redetermination is not
> filed within the time limit required, and the contractor did not find
> good cause for failure to file timely, it should dismiss the request.
>
> 4.Appointment of Representative is Defective - When an individual who
> is attempting to act as a representative of an appellant who is not
> the beneficiary submits an incomplete appointment form and the
> appointment is not corrected within the time limit discussed above in
> §270.1.6.B.1, the contractor dismisses the request.
>
> **NOTE:** If the appellant resubmits an appeal request with an
> appointment of representative form, the contractor should consider the
> request as a duplicate and should not count the resubmission as
> additional workload. (See Pub. 100-06, the Medicare Financial
> Management Manual, Chapter 6.)
>
> 5.Party Failed to Make A Valid Request - When the contractor
> determines the provider, supplier, or State failed to make out a valid
> request for redetermination that substantially complies with
> §310.1.B.1. or §310.1.B.2. A valid request may contain portions of the

> that the request substantially compts established in MACs shall not
> dismiss requests under when redeterminly comply with requirements.
>
> 6.Beneficiary Dies While the Request is Pending - When a beneficiary
> or the beneficiary's representative files a request for
> redetermination, but the beneficiary dies while the request is
> pending, the contractor issues a dismissal when all of the following
> criteria apply:
>
> *a)*The beneficiary\'s surviving spouse or estate has no remaining
> financial interest in the case. In deciding this issue, the contractor
> considers if the surviving spouse or estate remains liable for the
> services for which payment was denied or a Medicare contractor held
> the beneficiary liable for subsequent similar services under the
> limitation on liability provisions based on the denial of payment for

>
> *b)*No other individual or entity with a financial interest in the

>
> *c)*No other party filed a valid and timely redetermination request.
>
> 7.There is not an initial dete and §200.B above for actions that are

> determinations).

**B.Appeal Rights for Dismissals**

> Parties to the redetermination have the right to request a QIC review
> of the contractor's dismissal of a redetermination request if they
> believe the dismissal is incorrect. The request for review must be
> received by the QIC within **60 calendar days** after receipt of the
> notice of dismissal. The date of receipt of the notice of dismissal is
> presumed to be 5 calendar days after the date of the notice of
> dismissal, unless there is evidence to the contrary. When the QIC
> performs its review of the dismissal, it will decide if the dismissal
> was correct. If it determines that the contractor incorrectly
> dismissed the redetermination, it will vacate the dismissal and remand
> the case to the contractor for a redetermination. It is mandatory for
> the contractor to issue a new redetermination decision on any case
> remanded by the QIC. The new decision is counted in CROWD on the 2590,
> 2591 and 2592 as appropriate as a \"redetermination". A QIC's review
> of a contractor's dismissal of a redetermination request is binding
> and not subject to any further review.
>
> **NOTE:** QICs shall not include the "Important Information About Your
> Appeal Rights" insert when issuing a decision on requests to review a

>
> A party to the redetermination may also request that the contractor
> vacate its dismissal within 6 months of the date of the mailing
> (and/or other transmission if the contractor is utilizing a CMS

> if good and sufficient cause is established. If the contractor
> determines that there is good and sufficient cause, the contractor
> vacates its prior dismissal and issues a redetermination. For the
> purposes of counting workload in CROWD, this action should be counted

> Requests to Vacate Dismissals for more information.

**310.6.1 - Dismissal Letters**

***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:
10- 01-19)***

The MAC shall issue in writing and/or otherwise transmit, as noted
above, a notice of dismissal to all parties to the appeal. The dismissal
notice includes the reason for the dismissal. The dismissal notice must
inform parties that they may (1) request the MAC to vacate the
dismissal, and (2) may request a QIC\
reconsideration of the dismissal. The dismissal notice is sent to the
party requesting the redetermination at his/her last known address,
and/or otherwise transmitted as noted above, as well as to his/her
representative and all other parties to the appeal. MACs who utilize an
approved CMS secure Internet portal/application to receive and process
appeals may provide electronic dismissal notices, if the appeal request
was received via a secure portal/application. MACs shall ensure that a
hard copy dismissal notice is sent to other parties to the appeal who do
not have access to the secure Internet portal/application. See §310.10
for additional requirements related to notices sent via secure portal/
applications.

MACs shall include the following language, or something similar, in
dismissal letters (also see the model dismissal letters in Exhibits
2&3):

If you disagree with this dismissal, you have two options:

> 1.You may request that we vacate our dismissal. We will vacate our
> dismissal if you demonstrate good and sufficient cause for \<insert
> reason for dismissal\>. Your request to vacate this dismissal must be
> received at our office within **6 months** of the date of receipt of
> this notice at the address noted above.
>
> 2.If you think we have incorrectly dismissed your request (for
> example, you believe \<insert reason (e.g., you did file your request
> on time, you were a proper party, the MAC did issue an initial
> determination on the claim)\>), you may request a reconsideration of
> the dismissal by a Qualified Independent Contractor (QIC). Your
> request must be received by the QIC at the address below within 60
> days of receipt of this letter. In your request, please explain why

> Insert QIC Address

**Incomplete Requests -** The requirements for written requests for
redetermination are found in §310.1.B.2.

**NOTE:** Beneficiary requests should not be considered incomplete, see
§310.1.B.1 and §310.1.B.*3*.

MACs must handle and count incomplete redetermination requests as
dismissals. If a party submits an incomplete request for redetermination
and the MAC issues a dismissal notice, the party may request the
dismissal be vacated, the party may appeal the dismissal, or the party
may refile their request if any time remains in the filing period (i.e.,
120 days from receipt of the initial determination). When a request is
refiled that meets the requirements, the previous dismissal is vacated
and reopened. MACs must notify parties of their options in the dismissal
notice. Please see the model dismissal notice for an incomplete request
in §310.6.2.

additional verbiage/instructions if a MAC has received approval to
receive appeal requests via a secure Internet portal/application.

RE: \<Include claim identifier or appeal number\>

Dear \<Appellant's Name\>:\
This letter is in response to your appeal request (also known as a
redetermination) that was received in our office on \<INSERT DATE\>. The
redetermination was requested for the following dates of service
\<INSERT DATE(S)\>). Your redetermination request has been dismissed
because it did not form a valid request for redetermination. In order to
process a redetermination request, we need the following item(s) to be
addressed:

\<INSERT ALL APPLICABLE INFORMATION\>:

Missing Information:

•The beneficiary's name;

•The Medicare number of the beneficiary;

•The specific service(s) and/or item(s) for which the redetermination is
being requested and the specific date(s) of service;

•The name of the person filing the redetermination request.

> Invalid Request:

•The requestor is not a proper party;

•Defective Appointment of Representation (AOR) \<for non-beneficiary
submitted claims only\>;

•No initial determination on the claim(s) appealed; or

•Beneficiary is deceased with no remaining party or appointed
representative with financial interest.

Your request was determined to be invalid as explained above and
therefore has been dismissed. You may file your request again if it has
been 120 days or less since the date of receipt of the initial
determination notice. When you file your request, please make sure you
have addressed all of the above listed items and send your request to
our office at the address noted above.

If you disagree with this dismissal, you have two additional options:

1\. You may request that we vacate our dismissal. We will vacate our
dismissal if you demonstrate that you have good and sufficient cause for
failing to submit a valid request. Your request to vacate this dismissal
must be received at the address above within 6 months of the date of
receipt this notice.

2\. If you think we have incorrectly dismissed your request (that is,
you believe you did address all of the above listed items in your
request), you may request a reconsideration of this dismissal by a
Qualified Independent Contractor (QIC). Your request must be received by
the QIC at the address below within 60 days of receipt of this letter.
In your request, please explain why you believe the dismissal was
incorrect. The QIC will not consider any evidence for establishing
coverage of the claim(s) being appealed. Their examination will be
limited to whether or not the dismissal was appropriate. Please send
your request to:

\<INSERT QIC ADDRESS\>

Sincerely.

**310.6.3 -- Processing Requests to Vacate Dismissals**

***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:
10- 01-19)***

> If a party submits a request to vacate the dismissal, and the request
> contains sufficient evidence or other documentation that supports a
> finding of good cause for late filing, the MAC makes a favorable good
> cause determination. Where a finding for good cause is made, the MAC
> shall document the reason for that finding in the appeal decision
> letter, the appeal case file, or both.
>
> Once it makes a favorable good cause determination, it considers the
> appeal to be timely filed, vacates its prior dismissal action, and
> performs a redetermination. For the purposes of counting workload in
> CROWD and in the MAS, a determination to vacate a dismissal should be
> counted as a redetermination and not a reopening.
>
> If the MAC does not find good cause to vacate the dismissal, the
> dismissal remains in effect. The MAC issues a letter (not a dismissal
> letter) explaining that good cause has not been established and the
> dismissal cannot be vacated. Although the appellant may not appeal a
> MAC's finding that good cause was not established when the appellant
> requested that the MAC vacate its dismissal, the appellant maintains
> their right to request a QIC review of the MAC's dismissal action.
> However, requests for QIC review of a MAC's dismissal action must be
> received by the QIC within 60 days of the date of receipt of the
> dismissal notice. For purposes of counting workload in CROWD and in
> the MAS, a MAC's determination not to vacate a dismissal action is
> counted as an inquiry, not as a dismissal action.
>
> If an appellant requests that the MAC vacate the dismissal action, and
> the MAC determines that that it cannot vacate the dismissal, the MAC
> sends a letter notifying the appellant. The MAC shall not issue a
> second dismissal notice to the appellant since a dismissal should only
> be issued in response to an appeal request. A request to vacate a
> dismissal is not a request for an appeal.
>
> If the contractor determines that the request to vacate the dismissal
> of the redetermination request does not provide good and sufficient
> cause to vacate, the contractor shall respond with a letter that
> addresses why the request to vacate does not meet the criteria for
> good cause. Any evidence or information not previously submitted with
> the redetermination request that is submitted with the request to
> vacate the dismissal shall be addressed by the contractor in their
> letter. The contractor must explain in clear language why all evidence
> and information submitted, including what was sent with the request to
> vacate the dismissal, does not meet the requirement necessary to
> vacate the dismissal.

> **310.7 - Medicare Redetermination Notice (For Partly or Fully
> Unfavorable Redeterminations)**\
> ***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:
> 10- 01-19)***
>
> The contractor uses the following Medicare Redetermination Notice
> (MRN) format or something similar and standard language paragraphs
> whether the redetermination notice is delivered via hard copy mail or
> via a CMS-approved portal/application.
>
> **NOTE:** This is a model letter and should be adjusted on a case by
> case basis if necessary.
>
> Contractors may also include additional resources, including their
> website address(es) and/or telephone number(s). Appeals that involve
> issues such as Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) and overpayment
> recoveries may require contractors to deviate from the sample given in
> this manual section. Contractors must also include reference within
> all appropriate sections of the appeal decision letter that in
> instances where services are covered (for example, a partially
> favorable decision is rendered), the beneficiary may also be
> responsible for any copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles related to
> the covered portion of the service or item that is payable.

The contractor must ensure that the information identified in each
section of the model letter below is included and addressed, as needed,
in the MRN. Contractors shall include the request for reconsideration
form with the MRN. The contractor must fill in the contract number and
"appeal number" on each request for reconsideration form. The contract
number is only required for contractors who have multiple locations in
which a QIC will need to request a case file. The "appeal number" is any
number used to identify the associated appeal and will be used by the
QIC to request a case file. The contractor also shall include the
contractor logo or CMS logo with the contractor name and address on the
reconsideration request form for identification purposes. This logo will
be used by the QIC to identify which contractor to request the case file
from.

**A. Redetermination Letter**

The redetermination letterhead must follow the instructions issued by
CMS for contractor written correspondence requirements (see §290),
unless otherwise instructed and/or agreed to by CMS.

**WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BILL?**

> \<Instructions:1. Include, as applicable, information on limitation on
> liability under §1879 of the Act, physician refund requirements for
> non-assigned claims under §1842(l) of the Act, DMEPOS supplier refund
> requirements under §§1834 and 1879(h) of the Act, financial
> responsibility for benefit category denials (statutory exclusions),
> and waiver of overpayment recovery under §1870 of the Act.
>
> For example, if the denial reason triggers a liability determination
> under §1879 of the Act, include the following model paragraphs:
>
> "After determining that the item or service will not be covered by
> Medicare, we must determine who is financially liable for the denied
> item or service. When an item or service is denied under §1862(a)(1),
> §1862(a)(9), or §1879(g) of the Social Security Act (the Act), we must
> determine if the beneficiary and the provider or supplier either knew
> or could reasonably be expected to know that the item or service would
> not be covered. This is known as the limitation on liability provision
> of §1879 of the Act.
>
> If the beneficiary was informed by their provider or supplier in
> writing in advance of receiving the item/service that Medicare may not
> make payment (through receipt of an Advance Beneficiary Notice of
> Noncoverage (ABN)), the beneficiary may be responsible for the cost of
> the denied item or service. If the provider or supplier knew or could

> issue. If the provisions of §1879 of the Act do not apply to the

>
> (Beneficiary Option 2) "There is no evidence to indicate that the

>
> 4\. As noted above, the contractor shall (1) explain the basis for

> publication, or specific policy posted on the contractor's website,
> etc. may establish knowledge of non-coverage. See IOM 100-04, Chapter

>
> 5\. If neither the beneficiary, nor the provider or supplier knew or
> could reasonably have been expected to know that the item/service
> would not be covered, then Medicare makes payment for the item/service
> under §1879 of the Act.
>
> 6\. If there is evidence to indicate that the beneficiary may have
> paid in advance for the items/services (e.g., the claim was billed
> with a GA modifier indicating an ABN was given to the beneficiary), or
> paid the applicable deductible or coinsurance amounts, and the
> provider/supplier is subsequently held liable under §1879 of the Act
> for the denied items/services, the contractor shall include a

> regarding indemnification procedures and IOM 100-04, Chapter, 30,
> §§10-40 and 110-150 for more information on liability protections and

>
> 7\. If the basis for denial does not trigger the limitation

> the reason for the denial and includes the following, or similar
> language:
>
> Since the item/service is (not a covered benefit under Medicare)
> (excluded from coverage under Medicare), we cannot make payment. The
> (provider) (supplier) may bill the beneficiary for the denied

**310.11 - Effectuation of the Redetermination Decision**\
***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:
10- 01-19)***

All MACs are responsible for effectuating redetermination decisions.
Effectuation means for the MAC to adjust the claim and issue a payment
or to change liability. If the redetermination decision is fully or
partially favorable to the appellant and gives a specific amount to be
paid, the MAC effectuates within 30 calendar days of the date of the
redetermination decision.

If the decision is fully or partially favorable, but the payment amount
must be computed or recomputed, the MAC effectuates the decision within
30 days after the payment amount is determined. The payment amount must
be computed as soon as possible, but no later than 30 calendar days
after the date of the redetermination decision.

**310.12 - QIC Remands**\
***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:
10- 01-19)***

All MACs shall take appropriate action on review and resolve QIC remands
within 60 calendar days of receipt of the remand order from the QIC.

**320 - Reconsideration - The Second Level of Appeal**\
***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:

Section of the Act entitles any individual dissatisfied with the A/B MAC
(A)'s, (B)'s, (HHH)'DME MAC's redetermination to file a request80 days
of receipt of the redetermination, for a reconsideration. In accordance
with reconsiderations are to be processed within 60 days by entities
called qualified indeptractors (QICs). CMS is ract with no fewer than
four QICs. When a claim is denied on the basis of of the Act, the QIC
reconsideration will consist of a panel of physicians and other nals.
When the panel reviews services or items rendered by a physician or
ordered by a physician, the panel will consist of at least one
physician.

**320.1 - Filing a Request for a Reconsideration**\
***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:
10- 01-19)***

The request for a reconsideration made by a beneficiary, provider,
supplier, or State must be filed with the QIC specified in the
redetermination notice. A request from a provider, supplier, or State
must be made in writing either on the Form CMS-20033 (the
reconsideration request form included with the redetermination), or must
contain the following items:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| > •\                              | > The beneficiary's name;\        |
| > •\                              | > Medicare number;\               |
| > •                               | > The specific service(s) and     |
| >                                 | > item(s) for which the           |
| > •\                              | > reconsideration is requested    |
| > •                               | > and the specific date(s) of     |
|                                   | > service;\                       |
|                                   | > The name of the party or        |
|                                   | > representative of the party     |
|                                   | > filing the request; and The     |
|                                   | > name of the contractor that     |
|                                   | > made the redetermination.       |
+===================================+===================================+
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

A request from a beneficiary must be made in writing either on a
standard CMS form or another written format indicating dissatisfaction
with the redetermination. Requests for reconsideration may be submitted
in situations where beneficiaries assume that they will receive a
reconsideration by questioning a payment detail of the determination or
by sending additional information back with the MSN or MRN, but don't
actually say: I want a reconsideration. For example, a written inquiry
stating, "Why did you only pay \$10.00?" is considered a request for
reconsideration. Common examples of phrasing in letters from
beneficiaries that constitute requests for reconsideration:

> • "Please reconsider my claim."
>
> • "I am not satisfied with the amount paid - please look at it again."
>
> • "My neighbor got paid for the same kind of claim. My claim should be
> paid too."

The beneficiary's request may contain the word appeal or review. There
may be instances in which the word review is used but where the clear
intent of the request is for a status report. This should be considered
an inquiry.

**A. Request for Reconsideration (Form CMS-20033)**

The CMS provides a form for filing a request for reconsideration for the
convenience of appellants, website at:

**B. Requests Submitted to the Wrong Contractor**

Parties must request a reconsideration at the QIC with jurisdiction.
Contractors with multiple States may have multiple QICs handling
requests and, therefore, must make certain to refer the appellant to the
correct QIC. The jurisdiction for all Part A QIC appeals is dependent
upon the State where the service or item was rendered. The jurisdiction
for all DME and Part B QIC appeals is dependent upon the State where the
beneficiary resides. See §320.7 for the specific QIC jurisdictions.

There may be instances where requests for QIC reconsiderations are
misfiled with a contractor. Contractors shall have standard operating
procedures to ensure that misfiled requests are identified and
sent/transmitted to the proper location. If the contractor receives a
'request for reconsideration' from a party, or a 'request for
reconsideration' mistakenly directed to them by another contractor, and
the contractor has already conducted a redetermination, the contractor
shall forward the request to the appropriate QIC, along with the case
file(s), within 60 calendar days of receipt in the corporate mailroom.
The case file must be sent either by an electronic means agreed upon in
the JOAs or by a

courier service so that the case file is received by the QIC before or
on the 61st calendar day after the receipt. Contractors shall track all
misfiled reconsideration requests to ensure receipt at the proper QIC.
The QIC will send the MAC or DME MAC an acknowledgement of receipt of
any misfiled requests. Contractors shall not count such misfiled
requests as dismissals. The contractor counts the costs associated with
misfiled requests in the CAFM line designated for preparing/transferring
case files to the QIC. To aid in preventing misfiled requests for QIC
reconsiderations, contractors shall employ provider education efforts
with an emphasis on filing locations, as well as the dates for workload
transitions when a MAC jurisdiction is transferred from one contractor
to the next at the close of a contract's period of performance.

**NOTE:** If the contractor receives a 'request for reconsideration'
(assuming the appellant is using the wrong form or terminology), but
determines that a redetermination has not been conducted, the contractor
does not forward the request to the QIC. The contractor shall conduct a
redetermination.

**320.2 - Time Limit for Filing a Request for a Reconsideration *(Rev.
4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation: 10- 01-19)
***

A party must file a request for reconsideration within 180 days of the
date of receipt of the notice of the redetermination. The date of filing
for requests filed in writing is defined as the date received by the QIC
in their corporate mailroom. If the party has filed the request in
person with the QIC, the filing date is the date of filing at such
office, as evidenced by the receiving office's date stamp on the
request. If the party has mailed the request for reconsideration to a
CMS, SSA, RRB office, or another government agency in good faith within
the time limit, and the request did not reach the appropriate QIC until
after the time period to file a request expired, the QIC considers the
request as timely filed. Likewise, if the request is filed with CMS,
SSA, RRB, or another government agency in person, the QIC considers the
request as timely filed.

The QIC may extend the period for filing if it finds the appellant had
good cause for not requesting the reconsideration timely. (See §240 for
a discussion of good cause.)

**320.3 - MAC Responsibilities - General**\
***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:
10- 01-19)***

The contractor's responsibilities for reconsiderations are:

> 1\. Preparing and forwarding case files upon request from a QIC in
> accordance with §§320.4, 320.5, 320.6 and the JOA;
>
> 2\. Effectuating reconsiderations when notified by the QIC of a
> favorable decision or unfavorable decision with a change in liability
> in accordance with § 320.8 and notifying the QIC of receipt of
> effectuation information;
>
> 3\. Preparing case files and forward misfiled reconsideration requests
> in accordance with § 320.1(B); and
>
> 4\. Entering into JOAs with the appropriate QIC(s) and Administrative
> QIC (AdQIC); Complying with the appropriate JOAs.

**320.4 - QIC Case File Development**\
***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:
10- 01-19)***

When the QIC receives a request for reconsideration, it will request the
case file from the MAC with jurisdiction using the Redetermination Case
File Request Form. The QIC will send the request either by email,
telephone, fax, or by any other method agreed upon in the JOAs. (Note:
Individually identifiable beneficiary information should not be given in
an unsecure email.) If another method is agreed upon in the JOAs, it
must meet the privacy requirements of HIPAA.

If agreed upon in the JOAs, the following requirements apply to email,
fax and phone requests:

> **(a)** Email requests - MACs shall maintain an email account
> specifically for the receipt of case file requests from the QIC. If
> individually identifiable information is given in the request or
> response, a secure email account must be used. MACs must check this
> email account at least once daily (every business day). When MACs
> receive email requests from the QIC, they shall notify the QIC of
> receipt.
>
> **(b)** Phone Requests - MACs shall designate and maintain a phone
> extension specifically for the receipt of case file requests from the
> QIC. MACs shall designate a main contact person and back-up contact
> that is available to take phone calls during core business hours on
> all business days (unless otherwise agreed upon in the JOAs).
>
> **(c)** Fax Requests - MACs shall designate and maintain a fax machine
> for the receipt of case file requests from the QIC.

**320.5 - QIC Case File Preparation**\
***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:
10- 01-19)***

Once a party requests a reconsideration with a QIC, the QIC will need to
obtain the case file from the MAC that issued the redetermination
decision. The foundation for an effective, efficient and accurate
appeals system is the case file. It is essential that the case file
contain all relevant\
information and evidence concerning an appeal in an organized manner so
that the QIC can make a correct and fair determination. The MAC prepares
the case file by separating procedural documents

and medical documents and builds the case file from the bottom up, with
the oldest set of documents on the bottom, and the most recent set of
documents at the top. However, it does not place the medical
documentation on the bottom. Medical documentation does not need to be
ordered chronologically, but rather can be included in the case file as
submitted by the provider.

For large cases containing multiple beneficiary files, the MAC shall
organize the case files by individual beneficiary files in alphabetical
order. **A packing list will be included for multiple beneficiary box
cases and labeled as "box number x of y."**

As the MACs begin utilizing the MAS for processing redeterminations
(timeframe by jurisdiction TBD), the MACs shall work to update their
JOAs with QICs to include language indicating that the appeals case file
will be obtained via electronic promotion of the level one appeal record
within the MAS. The MAC QIC JOAs shall include language to address
situations in which the MAS is down or otherwise unavailable for short
term and/or long term periods of time. In addition, the JOA shall
include language to address processes and procedures for providing case
files that are not in the MAS due to the redetermination having been
processed prior to the level one MAS implementation and/or the rare
instance that the file is otherwise not available in the MAS.

For one QIC case addressing multiple beneficiaries, particularly large
multi-beneficiary and overpayment cases, the MAC shall keep the
documents relating to each beneficiary together and organized
alphabetically by beneficiary last name. Documents relating to each
beneficiary will be separated and a complete set of procedural documents
will be provided for each beneficiary.

The following is a list of the documents generally included in any case
file. Note that there may be others not listed here. For applicable
items, the MAC includes originals and retains hard copies of any
documents that are not available electronically for its records. Do not
send abbreviated versions, or versions of documents that the MAC has
retyped or paraphrased for purposes of shortening the document. The MAC
must keep an exact copy of the file that is sent to the QIC. (Note: This
applies only when documents are not otherwise available electronically.)
If it is unable to include the original documents, it includes
photocopies that are true facsimiles of the original documents. It
arranges the following documents, in descending date order (i.e., the
claim form is on the bottom).

**Reconsideration Case Transmittal Form**

The Reconsideration Case Transmittal Form documents the claim
information and the date of the redetermination. It also identifies the
MAC that made the redetermination and the QIC with jurisdiction for the
reconsideration. The summary sheet should be placed on top of the
documents in the case file. The QIC will provide a Reconsideration Case
Transmittal Form for use in the JOA.

MACs shall send/transmit the case file within 7 [calendar
days]{.underline} of the date of the QIC\'s request. The date of QIC\'s
request is defined as the date the p[hone call is m]{.underline}ade (if
a message is left, it is defined as the date the message was left) or
the date of the email request. The case files must be sent either by an
electronic means agreed upon in the joint operating agreement or by a
courier service so that the case file is received by the QIC before or
on the 8th calendar day after its request. The MAC counts the costs
associated with sending case files in the Contractor Administrative
Budget and Financial Management (CAFM) code designated for
preparing/transferring case files to the QIC.

***(Rev. 4380, Issued: 08-30-19, Effective: 07-08-19, Implementation:

Contractors shall track all incoming requests for case files from the
QICs. The contractor shall keep a record of the date of the request, the
format of the request (e.g., telephone, emails, electronic) the date the
case file was forwarded to the QIC, and the means of forwarding (e.g.
Fed Ex Same Day, Fed Ex overnight, UPS 2 day). If a courier service is
used, the contractor shall utilize the courier service's tracking
mechanism to keep a record of the date of receipt at the QIC.

Contractors shall track all misfiled reconsideration requests to ensure
receipt at the proper QIC. The QIC will send the MAC or DME MAC an
acknowledgement of receipt of any misfiled

For the convenience of parties, OMHA provides forms that may be used to
request a Medicare ALJ hearing. It is not necessary, however, that this
form be used to make a written request.

> •The request for hearing form "OMHA-100":

> •In addition, the form OMHA‑100A is used as an attachment to form

> direct link to form "OMHA-100A":
>
> •The link to OMHA's webpage containing all forms:

To request that OMHA make a decision without a hearing based only on the
information that's in the appeal record, an appellant must submit the
information required for an ALJ hearing request and one of these:

> •The "Waiver of Right to an Adm

> **(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:

Requests for ALJ hearings are to be filed with the OMHA office at the
address specified in the QIC's reconsideration notice. However, there
may be times when parties incorrectly file requests for hearings with
either the MAC or QIC. When a MAC receives such a misfiled request, it
forwards the misfiled request to the OMHA Central Docketing location
within 30 calendar days of receipt. All MACs shall maintain a record of
these cases.

Requests for all ALJ hearings must be filed at the following location:

> OMHA Centralized Docketing
>
> 200 Public Square, Suite 1260
>
> Cleveland, OH 44114-2316

> **(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
> 06-13-19)**

The Administrative QIC (AdQIC) is the clearinghouse for all Original
Medicare (Part A and Part B) claim case files and decisions from the
OMHA field offices as well as any decisions and case files from the
Appeals Council. The AdQIC reviews OMHA decisions for possible agency
referral to the Appeals Council. For Appeals Council decisions and for
OMHA decisions when no agency referral is planned, the AdQIC will send
the MAC an effectuation notice, a copy of the decision, and a summary of
the associated claims from the MAS.

The MAC only effectuates based on documentation received from the AdQIC;
the MAC does not effectuate based on correspondence from any party to
the ALJ hearing or attorney adjudicator review. \"Effectuate\" means for
the MAC to issue a payment or change liability.

In the event that the MAC's claims payment review finds the OMHA or
Appeals Council decision to be inconsistent or inaccurate in comparison
to claims history the MAC may request assistance from the AdQIC in
seeking clarification from OMHA or the Appeals Council.

> **(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:

In most cases, OMHA will: (1) issue a decision based on the request for
an ALJ hearing or review; or (2) issue an order of dismissal of the
appellant's request for ALJ hearing or review; or (3) remand the case to
the QIC.

If OMHA's decision is partially or wholly favorable to the appellant and
gives a specific amount to be paid, the MAC effectuates within 30
calendar days of receipt of the effectuation notice from the AdQIC. The
MAC must acknowledge receipt of the AdQIC effectuation per the JOA with
the AdQIC.

If the decision is partially or wholly favorable but the amount must be
computed by the MAC, it effectuates the decision within 30 days after it
computes the amount to be paid to the appellant. The amount must be
computed as soon as possible, but no later than within 30 calendar days
of the date of receipt of the effectuation notice from the AdQIC.

For effectuation of decisions that involve overpayments or underpayments
where the limitation on recoupment provision applies (Section 935 of
MMA), refer to IOM Pub. 100-06, Chapter 3, §200 for further instruction.

If clarification from the AdQIC is necessary, the MAC considers the date
of the clarification the final determination for purposes of
effectuation. If clarification is needed from the
provider/physician/supplier (e.g., splitting charges), the MAC requests
clarification as soon as possible and computes the amount payable within
30 calendar days after the receipt of the necessary clarification. The
MAC considers the date of receipt of the clarification as the date of
the final determination for purposes of effectuation.

**330.5 - Duplicate OMHA Decisions**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

If the MAC becomes aware of a duplicate decision from OMHA on the same
case, it must bring this to the attention of the AdQIC immediately. In
these cases the AdQIC will take the necessary steps to resolve the
issue.

**340 - Departmental Appeals Board - Appeals Council - The Fourth Level
of Appeal**\
**(Rev. 4278., Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

The level of administrative review available to parties after the ALJ
hearing decision, OMHA attorney adjudicator review, or dismissal order
has been issued, but before judicial review is available, is Appeals
Council review.

A party to an ALJ hearing or an OMHA attorney adjudicator review, may
request review by the Appeals Council within 60 days after receipt of
the notice of OMHA's decision or dismissal. If a party requests the
Appeals Council to review an ALJ's or attorney adjudicator's decision,
the Appeals Council may conduct a de novo review of the decision and may
adopt, modify, or reverse the ALJ's or attorney adjudicator's decision,e
to an ALJ or attorney adjudicator for further proceedings. See, in
general The Appeals Council will dismiss a request for review when a
partyght to Appeals Council review.

When a party requests that the Appeals Council review an ALJ's or
attorney adjudicator\'s dismissal, the Appeals Council may deny review
or remand the case to an ALJ or attorney adjudicator for further
proceedings. The Appeals Council may also dismiss a request for a
hearing for any reason the ALJ or attorney adjudicator could have
dismissed the request for hearing. In addition, the Appeals Council will
decide cases that are escalated from the OMHA level without an ALJ or
attorney adjudicator decision or dismissal.

See The Appeals Council may also decide on its own motion to review a
deced by an ALJ or attorney adjudicator within 60 days after the date of
the decision or dismissal.

**340.1 - Recommending Agency Referral of OMHA Decisions or Dismissals
(Rev. 4278., Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

CMS may refer a case to the Appeals Council for it to consider under its
own motion review authority within 60 days after the date of the ALJ
hearing or attorney adjudicator decision or dismissal. This is known as
an "agency referral". The Appeals Council may adopt, modify, or reverse
OMHA's decision, may remand the case to an ALJ or attorney adjudicator
for further proceedings, or may dismiss an agency referral request. For
OMHA decisions issued by OMHA ALJs and attorney adjudicators, the AdQIC
will be responsible for reviewing ALJ and attorney adjudicator decisions
and determining whether an agency referral is appropriate.

During the effectuation of an ALJ or attorney adjudicator decision, if
the MAC's medical director disagrees with the decision and wishes to
discuss the decision for potential referral to the Appeals Council, the
medical director shall contact the AdQIC.

**340.2 - Effectuation of Appeals Council Orders and Decisions (Rev.

If a MAC receives a copy of a summons or complaint for judicial review
in federal district court, and it does not appear that a copy was sent
to the following address, the MAC shall send the original to:

Department of Health and Human Services\
General Counsel\
200 Independence Avenue, S.W.

Washington, D.C. 20201

The MAC retains a copy and notifies its Contracting Officer's
Representative (COR) immediately. The CMS COR should alert the CMS
Central Office Counsel that a complaint has been forwarded by the MAC to
the HHS General Counsel's office.

**(Rev. 2729, Issued: 06-21-13, Effective: 07-23-13, Implementation:

The U.S. District Court may remand the case to the Appeals Council or
ALJ for further proceedings. In rare cases, the U.S. District Court will
issue an order that will require effectuation by a MAC. In this
situation, the MAC immediately contacts its Contracting Officer's
Representative/Contractor Manager for further instructions before taking
any action.

**350 - Workload Data Analysis**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

Data analysis involves collecting relevant data, analyzing the data,
identifying trends and aberrancies, and making conclusions based on the
data collected. Data analysis should be performed, as needed, at all
relevant operational sites to identify inefficiencies or problems with
appeals. Within the constraints of the current operating environment,
MACs should work to address and resolve concerns. Significant issues
should be raised to CMS, preferably through the COR or Contract Manager.

**360 - Managing Appeals Workloads**\
**(Rev. 675, Issued: 09-16-05, Effective: 10-01-05, Implementation:
10-03-05)**

**360.1 - Standard Operating Procedures**\
**(Rev. 2729, Issued: 06-21-13, Effective: 07-23-13, Implementation:
07-23-13)**

The priorities set forth in this section are to be used by MACs as a
guide in establishing standard operating procedures for managing an
appeals workload when the budget amount is

insufficient to adequately perform the required functions. In general,
MACs should use a first-in, first-out method to process appeals and
manage workload; however, during times of limited resources it may
become necessary to prioritize the processing of appeals to more
efficiently manage the workload. While CMS continues to recommend the
priorities listed in this section, there may be instances where MACs
find it more effective and efficient to prioritize in a different
manner. Also, MACs may choose to establish standard operating procedures
for managing an appeals workload that deviate from the priorities listed
in this section. In both these cases, MACs should submit a copy of their
prioritization plan to the Contracting Officer's
Representative/Contractor Manager and obtain written approval for this
variation within 30 days of the start of the fiscal year or period of
performance.

**360.2 - Execution of Workload Prioritization**\
**(Rev. 4278, Issued: 04-12-19, Effective: 06-13-19, Implementation:
06-13-19)**

**A. Budget Related Workload Prioritization**

Whenever it appears that the budget amount is insufficient to adequately
perform the required functions and the need for additional funds can be
adequately documented, MACs shall submit a Supplemental Budget Request
(SBR) in accordance with the IOM Pub. 100-06 Medicare Financial
Management Manual, chapter 2 §120. As a result of an SBR, or during the
course of CMS\' evaluation of an SBR, CMS may find it necessary that the
MAC execute prioritization of workload in accordance with this section
or in accordance with the MAC's standard operating procedures. The MAC
should discuss possible alternatives for resolution in the SBR. If it
becomes necessary to abate activities, MACs must submit proper
notification in accordance with the terms of the Cost of Administration
Article in the Contract/Agreement and begin processing work in
accordance with this PM until a final agreement is reached between the
MAC and CMS. As a result of an abatement, CMS may find it necessary that
the MAC continue processing work in accordance with this manual
instruction.

**B. Other Circumstances That May Lead to Workload Prioritization**

In circumstances other than those described above, it may become
apparent that prioritization of workload is necessary because a MAC is
unable to complete the incoming or pending workload within the time
frames described in this manual. In these situations the MAC must either
consult with the COR immediately for guidance or notify the COR that
they plan to initiate their workload prioritization plan. An example of
a situation that may lead to workload prioritization is an
uncharacteristic, unanticipated increase in receipts over a two-month
period, coupled with, insufficient staff or other resources that will
impede you from completing the increased volume of appeals receipts in a
timely manner.
