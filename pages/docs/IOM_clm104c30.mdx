> (Rev.: 4197; Issued: 01-11-19; Effective: 04-15-19; Implementation:
> 04-15-19)**
>
> The FLP provisions of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to
> as the Act) protect beneficiaries, healthcare providers, and suppliers
> under certain circumstances from unexpected liability for charges
> associated with claims that Medicare does not pay. The FLP provisions
> apply after an item or service's coverage determination is made. This
> chapter discusses the following FLP provisions:
>
> • Limitation On Liability (LOL) under §1879(a)-(g) of the Act.
>
> • Refund Requirements (RR) for Non-assigned Claims for Physicians
> Services under §1842(l) of the Act.
>
> • Refund Requirements (RR) for Assigned and Non-assigned Claims for
> Medical Equipment and Supplies under §§1834(a)(18), 1834(j)(4), and
> 1879(h) of the Act.
>
> In most cases, the FLP provisions apply only to beneficiaries enrolled
> in the Original Medicare FFS program Parts A and B.
>
> The FLP provisions apply only when both of the following are met:
>
> •Items and/or services are denied on the basis of specific statutory
> or regulatory provisions.; and
>
> •Involve determinations about beneficiary and/or healthcare
> provider/supplier knowledge of whether Medicare was likely to deny
> payment for the items and/or
>
> services.
>
> The LOL provisions apply to all Part A services and all assigned
> claims for Part B services. The RR apply to both assigned and
> unassigned claims for medical equipment and supplies and to unassigned
> claims for physicians' services. However, RR do not apply to claims
> for Part A services.
>
> **20 - Limitation On Liability (LOL) Under §1879 Where Medicare Claims
> Are Denied**\
> **(Rev.: 4197; Issued: 01-11-19; Effective: 04-15-19; Implementation:
> 04-15-19)**
>
> In general, application of the LOL provisions depends upon two primary
> factors:
>
> 1.Whether the claim for the item and/or service provided was denied
> for certain specific reasons. See §21 of this chapter for more
> examples.

> • The physician indicated the patient could be discharged;

>
> When an item and/or service furnished do not meet locally acceptable

> considered to have known that Medicare payment would be denied.
> Because healthcare provider and supplier licensure is premised on the

> to have knowledge about locally acceptable standards of practice for
> liability determinations. No other evidence of knowledge of local
> medical standards of practice is necessary.
>
> In order to determine what "acceptable standards of practice" exist
> within the local medical community, Medicare contractors will rely on
> the following:
>
> •published medical literature;1
>
> •a consensus of expert medical opinion;2 and
>
> *1 "Published medical literature" refers generally to scientific data

>
> •consultations with their medical staff, medical associations,

> **NOTE:** A healthcare provider or supplier may indicate on the claim
> (via Occurrence Code 32 or the applicable Healthcare Common Procedure
> Coding System code modifier (i.e. GA, GX, ext.) on contractor claims)
> that they gave the beneficiary a valid written notice before

> evidence of the beneficiary's knowledge for the purposes of the FLP

>
> A written notice will not be considered as acceptable evidence of

> •Unreadable, illegible, or otherwise incomprehensible, or the

> **40.2.1 - Other Written Notice Standards**\
> **(Rev.: 4197; Issued: 01-11-19; Effective: 04-15-19; Implementation:
> 04-15-19)**
>
> **A. Timeliness**
>
> Written notice delivery:
>
> •Must be issued far enough in advance of an event (e.g., receiving a
> medical service) so that the beneficiary can make a rational, informed
> decision without undue pressure; or\
> •Should take place before a procedure is initiated and before physical
> preparation of the patient (e.g., disrobing, placement in or
> attachment of diagnostic or treatment equipment) begins.
>
> Written notice is permissible:
>
> •If a situation arises when a notifier sees a need for a previously
> unforeseen item or service and expects that Medicare will not pay for
> it only in certain specific denial reasons, provided that the
> beneficiary is capable of receiving notice and has a meaningful
> opportunity to act on it (e.g., the beneficiary is not under general
> anesthesia); or
>
> •Where it is foreseeable that the need for service for which Medicare
> likely would not pay may arise during the course of an encounter, and
> the beneficiary is either certain or likely not to be capable of
> receiving notice during the initial service (e.g., the beneficiary
> will be under anesthesia).
>
> **NOTE:** Last minute notification can be coercive, and a coercive
> notice is an invalid notice.
>
> **B. Written Notice Delivery**
>
> A written notice:
>
> •Should be delivered in person to the beneficiary or authorized
> representative whenever possible. Delivery is the notifier's
> responsibility;
>
> •Must be prepared with an original and at least two copies. The
> notifier should retain the original and give the copy to the
> beneficiary or authorized
>
> representative. Legible duplicates (carbons, etc.), fax copies,
> electronically scanned copies, or photocopies will suffice;
>
> •Copy should be given to the beneficiary (or authorized
> representative) immediately after the beneficiary (or authorized
> representative) signs it.
>
> If a beneficiary is not given a copy of the written notice and if the
> beneficiary later alleges that the written notice presented to the
> Medicare contractor by the notifier is different in any material
> respect from the written notice s/he signed, the Medicare contractor
> will give credence to the beneficiary's allegations. If the notifier
> is unable to deliver the notice to the beneficiary, the Medicare
> contractor will hold that the\
> beneficiary did not receive proper written notice and will hold the
> notifier liable.
>
> In a case where the notifier that gives a written notice is not the
> entity which ultimately bills Medicare for the item(s) and/or
> service(s), (e.g., when a physician draws a test specimen and sends it
> to a laboratory for testing) the notifier should give a copy of the
> signed written notice to the billing entity as well as the
> beneficiary.
>
> **C. Reason for Predicting Denial**
>
> The written notice must give the beneficiary a reasonable idea of why
> the notifier is predicting the likelihood of Medicare denial so that
> the beneficiary can make an informed decision whether or not to
> receive the item or service and pay for it. Statements of reasons for
> predicting Medicare denial of payment at a level of detail similar to
> the approved "Medical Necessity" messages for Medicare Summary Notices
> are acceptable for written notice purposes. If more than one reason
> for denial could apply (e.g., exceeding a frequency limit and "same
> day" duplication; cases where the reason for denial could depend upon
> the result of a test; etc.), the Medicare contractor will not
> invalidate a written notice on the basis of citing more than one
> reason for denial.
>
> The following could result in an invalid written notice:\
> •Simply stating "medically unnecessary" or the equivalent is not an
> acceptable reason, as it does not explain why the healthcare provider
> or supplier believes the
>
> item and/or service will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.
>
> •Listing several reasons which apply in different situations without
> indicating which reason is applicable in the beneficiary's particular
> situation generally is not
>
> an acceptable practice.
>
> **40.2.2 - Written Notice Special Considerations**\
> **(Rev.: 4197; Issued: 01-11-19; Effective: 04-15-19; Implementation:
> 04-15-19)**
>
> **A. Responsiveness to Inquiries**
>
> A notifier must answer any questions from a beneficiary regarding the
> written notice.
>
> This includes requests for further information and/or assistance in
> understanding and responding to a notice. The Medicare contractor will
> hold that a beneficiary did not receive proper written notice in any
> case where it finds that the notifier refused to answer inquiries.
>
> **B. Dealing With Beneficiary Refusals**
>
> A beneficiary who has been given a written notice may decide to
> receive the item(s) and/or service(s). In this case, the beneficiary
> should indicate that s/he is willing to be personally and fully
> responsible for payment. When a beneficiary decides to decline an item
> or service, s/he should so indicate. If a beneficiary refuses to sign
> a valid written notice, the notifier should consider not furnishing
> the item or service, unless the consequences (health and safety of the
> patient, or civil liability in case of harm) are such that this is not
> an option. Additionally, the notifier may annotate the written notice
> indicating the circumstances and persons involved. The notifier should
> have the annotation witnessed.
>
> •**Claims to Which LOL Provisions Apply -** If the beneficiary demands
> the item or service and refuses to pay, the notifier should have a
> second person witness the provision of the written notice and the
> beneficiary's refusal to sign. Where there is only one person on site
> (e.g., in a "draw station"), the second witness may be contacted by
> telephone to witness the beneficiary's refusal to sign the written
> notice by telephone and may sign the written notice annotation at a
> later time. An unused patient signature line on the written notice
> form may be used for such an annotation; writing in the margins of the
> form is also permissible. The notifier should file its claim as having
> given the written notice. The beneficiary will be held liable in case
> of a denial.
>
> •**Claims to Which RR Provisions Apply** - if the physician or
> supplier does furnish the item or service, the beneficiary's signature
> is meant to attest both to receipt of the written notice and to the
> beneficiary's agreement to pay. The beneficiary must receive a valid
> written notice so that s/he is "on notice" (that is, the beneficiary
> "knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that payment
> could not be made") and must agree to pay. The beneficiary has the
> same two legitimate choices as the cases of claims to which LOL
> provisions apply. If the beneficiary demands the item or service and
> refuses to pay (will not sign or else marks out the agreement to pay
> language), the physician or supplier must take into account the fact
> that it will not be able to collect from the\
> beneficiary in deciding whether or not to furnish the items or
> services. Although there would be little point in having a second
> person witness the provision of the written notice and the
> beneficiary's refusal to agree to pay (because the\
> requirement that the beneficiary agree to pay still would not be
> fulfilled), the
>
> physician or supplier may annotate the written notice. If the items or
> services are furnished despite the beneficiary's refusal to pay, the
> physician or supplier should file the claim as not having obtained a
> signed written notice. The Medicare contractor will not hold the
> beneficiary liable and will hold the physician or supplier liable.
>
> **NOTE:** In either case, the beneficiary who does receive an item or
> service, of course, always\
> has the right to a Medicare determination and the claim must be filed
> with Medicare.
>
> **C. Routine Notice Prohibition**
>
> In general, the "routine" use of written notices is not effective and
> therefore is not an acceptable practice. By "routine" use, CMS means
> giving written notice to beneficiaries where there is no specific,
> identifiable reason to believe Medicare will not pay. Notifiers should
> only give written notices to beneficiaries when there is some genuine
> doubt that Medicare will make payment. If the Medicare contractor
> identifies a pattern of routine notices in situations where such
> notices clearly are not valid, it will write to the notifier and
> remind it of these standards. While in general, routine written
> notices are invalid and will not protect the notifier from liability,
> there are some exceptions.
>
> •**Generic Written Notices** -- "Generic written notices" are routine
> written notices to beneficiaries which do no more than state that
> Medicare denial of payment **is possible**, or that the notifier never
> knows whether Medicare will deny payment.
>
> Such "generic written notices" are not considered to be acceptable
> evidence of written notice and will not protect the notifier from
> liability. The written notice must specify the item and/or service and
> a genuine reason that denial by Medicare is expected. Written notice
> standards likewise are not satisfied by a generic document that is
> little more than a signed statement by the beneficiary to the effect
> that, should Medicare deny payment for anything, the beneficiary
> agrees to pay for the item and/or service.
>
> •**Blanket Written Notices** - Giving written notices for all claims
> or items or services (i.e., "blanket written notices") is not an
> acceptable practice. Notice must be given to a beneficiary on the
> basis of a genuine judgment about the likelihood of Medicare payment
> for that individual's claim.
>
> •**Signed Blank Written Notices** - A notifier is prohibited from
> obtaining\
> beneficiary signatures on blank written notices and then completing
> the written notices later. In order for a written notice to be
> effective, it must be completed before delivery to the beneficiary.
> The Medicare contractor will hold any written notice that was blank
> when it was signed to be an invalid notice that will not protect the
> notifier from liability.
>
> •**Routine Written Notice Prohibition Exceptions** - In general,
> routine written notices will not be considered valid. There are,
> however, a few limited\
> circumstances when a routine notice can be given to a beneficiary and
> considered effective.

**40.3 - Medical Emergency or Otherwise Under Great Duress Situations**

> **(Rev.: 4197; Issued: 01-11-19; Effective: 04-15-19; Implementation:
> 04-15-19)**
>
> A written notice should not be obtained from a beneficiary in a
> medical emergency or otherwise under great duress (i.e., when
> circumstances are compelling and coercive) since that individual
> cannot be expected to make a reasoned informed decision. A beneficiary
> (or authorized representative) cannot be expected to make an informed,
> rational decision when in an emergency situation and therefore cannot
> be considered a capable recipient. If the beneficiary is not capable
> of receiving the notice, then the beneficiary has not received proper
> written notice and cannot be held liable where the LOL or RR
> provisions apply, and the notifier may be held liable.
>
> **Examples:**
>
> •Ambulance companies may not give written notices to beneficiaries
> (or\
> authorized representatives) in any emergency transport because such
> beneficiaries
>
> are under great duress.
>
> •Skilled nursing facilities may not give written notices in the case
> of "middle-of-the-night" emergencies or in any other emergency
> circumstances, since the beneficiary clearly cannot make an informed
> decision.
>
> **NOTE:** The Medicare contractor will consider any written notice
> given in any kind of coercive circumstances, including medical
> emergencies, to be invalid. The Medicare
>
> contractor will determine the healthcare provider's or supplier's
> liability by the appropriate knowledge standards which are used in
> cases where written notices are not given and beneficiary agreements
> to pay are not obtained.
>
> **40.4 - Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)
> Situations**\
> **(Rev.: 4197; Issued: 01-11-19; Effective: 04-15-19; Implementation:
> 04-15-19)**
>
> A written notice should not be given to a beneficiary in any case in
> which EMTALA (§1867 of the Act) applies, until the hospital has met
> its obligations under EMTALA.
>
> These include completion of a medical screening examination (MSE) to
> determine the presence or absence of an emergency medical condition,
> or until an emergency medical condition has been stabilized. The CMS
> published this policy in the November 10, 1999 OIG/HCFA Special
> Advisory Bulletin on the Patient Anti-Dumping Statute: "A hospital
> would violate the patient anti-dumping statute if it delayed a medical
> screening\
> examination or necessary stabilizing treatment in order to prepare an
> ABN and obtain a beneficiary signature. The best practice would be for
> a hospital not to give financial responsibility forms or notices to an
> individual, or otherwise attempt to obtain the individual's agreement
> to pay for services before the individual is stabilized. This is
> because the circumstances surrounding the need for such services, and
> the individual's limited information about his or her medical
> condition, may not permit an individual to make a rational, informed
> consumer decision." This policy applies in any case in which EMTALA
> applies, not only to EMTALA cases seen in emergency rooms (ERs). This
> policy also includes times when a beneficiary does not appear to have
> a life threatening condition, rather, h/she is seeking primary care
> services at an ER, if EMTALA applies.
>
> A written notice that is otherwise appropriate may be given to a
> Medicare beneficiary who is seen in the ER after completion of an MSE,
> but a written notice should not be given unless there is a genuine
> reason to expect that Medicare will deny payment for the item and/or
> service. EMTALA does not prohibit asking payment questions entirely,
> rather, only doing so before screening/stabilization. After
> screening/stabilization, EMTALA no longer applies and written notices
> may be given, as applicable, to\
> beneficiaries who come to emergency care settings after they have
> received a medical screening examination and are stabilized.
>
> **50 - Advance Beneficiary Notice of Non-coverage (ABN)**\
> **(Rev. 10862; Issued: 07-14-21; Effective: 10-14-21; Implementation:
> 10-14-21)**
>
> **A. General Statutory Authority - Applicability to Limitation on
> Liability (LOL)**
>
> Section 1879 of the Act (where the LOL provisions are located)
> requires a healthcare provider or supplier (i.e. notifier) to notify a
> beneficiary in advance of furnishing an item or service when s/he
> believes that items or services will likely be denied by Medicare for
> any of the reasons specified in the statutory provision in order to
> shift financial liability to the beneficiary for the denial. For
> example, advance notice is required if the item or service may be
> denied as not reasonable and necessary under §1862(a)(1) of the Act or
> because the item or service constitutes custodial care under
> §1862(a)(9) of the Act.
>
> Notice (e.g., the ABN) is a way for healthcare providers or suppliers
> to establish beneficiary knowledge of non-coverage and therefore,
> shift financial liability for these items or services if Medicare
> denies the claim.
>
> **B. Compliance with Limitation on Liability Provisions**\
> A notifier who fails to comply with the ABN instructions risks
> financial liability and/or sanctions. LOL provisions shall apply as
> required by law, regulations, rulings and program instructions.
> Additionally, when authorized by law and regulations, sanctions under
> the Conditions of Participation (COPs) may be imposed.
>
> The Medicare contractor may hold any healthcare provider or supplier
> who either failed to give notice when required, or gave defective
> notice, financially liable. A notifier who can demonstrate that s/he
> did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that
> Medicare would not make payment will not be held financially liable
> for failing to give notice. However, a notifier who gave defective
> notice may not claim that s/he did not know or could not reasonably
> have been expected to know that Medicare would not make payment, as
> the issuance of the notice is clear evidence of knowledge. A notifier
> who cannot demonstrate that adequate advance notice was furnished to
> the beneficiary will not be able to use the provisions in section 1879
> of the Act to transfer financial liability to the beneficiary.

> 10-14-21)**
>
> Step-by-step instructions for notice completion are posted along with

>
> **A.Other Considerations During ABN Completion**
>
> **1. Beneficiary Changes His/her Mind**
>
> If after completing and signing the ABN, a beneficiary changes his/her
> mind, the notifier should present the previously completed ABN to the
> beneficiary and request that the beneficiary annotate the original
> ABN. The annotation must include a clear indication of
>
> his/her new option selection along with the beneficiary\'s signature
> and date of annotation. In situations where the notifier is unable to
> present the ABN to the beneficiary in person, the notifier may
> annotate the form to reflect the beneficiary\'s new choice and\
> immediately forward a copy of the annotated notice to the beneficiary
> to sign, date, and return.
>
> In both situations, a copy of the annotated ABN should be provided to
> the beneficiary as soon as possible. If a related claim has been
> filed, it should be revised or cancelled if necessary to reflect the
> beneficiary's new choice.
>
> **2. Beneficiary Refuses to Complete or Sign the Notice**
>
> If the beneficiary refuses to choose an option and/or refuses to sign
> the ABN when required, the notifier should annotate the original copy
> of the ABN indicating the refusal to sign or choose an option and may
> list witness(es) to the refusal on the notice although this is not
> required. If a beneficiary refuses to sign a properly delivered ABN,
> the notifier should consider not furnishing the item/service, unless
> the consequences (health and safety of the patient, or civil liability
> in case of harm) are such that this is not an option.
>
> In any case, the notifier should provide a copy of the annotated ABN
> to the beneficiary, and keep the original version of the annotated
> notice in the patient's file.
>
> **50.7 - ABN Retention**\
> **(Rev. 10862; Issued: 07-14-21; Effective: 10-14-21; Implementation:
> 10-14-21)**
>
> The notifier should retain the ABN delivered to the beneficiary on
> file should there be any question regarding whether the beneficiary
> had knowledge of the potential financial liability. In certain
> situations, such as delivery by fax, the notifier may not have access
> to the original document upon signing. Retention of a copy of the
> signed document would be acceptable in specific cases such as this.
>
> In a case where the notifier that gives an ABN is not the entity that
> ultimately bills Medicare for the item or service (e.g. when a
> physician issues an ABN, draws a test specimen, and sends it to a
> laboratory for testing), the notifier should give a copy of the signed
> ABN to the billing entity.
>
> In general, it is 5 years from discharge/completion of delivery of
> care when there are no other applicable requirements under State law.
> Electronic retention of the signed paper document is acceptable.
> Notifiers may scan the signed paper or "wet" version of the ABN for
> electronic medical record retention and if desired, give the paper
> copy to the beneficiary.
>
> **50.8 -Effective ABN Delivery**\
> **(Rev. 10862; Issued: 07-14-21; Effective: 10-14-21; Implementation:
> 10-14-21)**
>
> ABN delivery is considered to be effective when the ABN is:
>
> 1.Delivered by a suitable notifier to a capable recipient and
> comprehended by that recipient.
>
> 2.Provided using the correct OMB approved notice with all required
> blanks completed. Failure to use the correct notice may lead to the
> notifier being found liable since the burden of proof is on the
> notifier to show that knowledge was conveyed to the beneficiary
> according to CMS instructions.
>
> 3.Delivered to the beneficiary in person if possible.
>
> 4.Provided far enough in advance of delivering potentially non-covered
> items or services to allow sufficient time for the beneficiary to
> consider all available options.
>
> 5.Explained in its entirety, and all of the beneficiary's related
> questions are answered timely, accurately, and completely to the best
> of the notifier's ability.
>
> The notifier should direct the beneficiary to call 1-800-MEDICARE if
> the\
> beneficiary has questions s/he cannot answer. If a Medicare contractor
> finds that the notifier refused to answer a beneficiary's inquiries or
> direct them to 1-800-MEDICARE, the notice delivery will be considered
> defective, and the notifier will be held financially liable for
> non-covered care.
>
> 6.Signed by the beneficiary.
>
> **A.Period of Effectiveness/Repetitive or Continuous Non-covered
> Care**
>
> An ABN remains effective after valid delivery so long as there has
> been no change in:
>
> •Care from what is described on the original ABN;\
> •The beneficiary's health status which would require a change in the
> subsequent treatment for the non-covered condition; and/or\
> •The Medicare coverage guidelines for the items or services in
> question (i.e., updates or changes to the policy of an item or
> service).
>
> **NOTE:** If any of the above changes during the course of treatment,
> a new ABN must be issued.
>
> For items or services that are repetitive or continuous in nature,
> notifiers may issue another ABN to a beneficiary after one year for
> subsequent treatment for the non-
>
> covered condition. However, this is not required unless any of the
> conditions described above apply to the given situation.
>
> Notifiers may give a beneficiary a single ABN describing an extended
> or repetitive course of non-covered treatment provided that the ABN
> lists all items and services that the notifier believes Medicare will
> not cover. If applicable, the ABN must also specify the duration of
> the period of treatment. If during the course of treatment additional
> non-covered items or services are needed, the notifier must give the
> beneficiary another ABN.
>
> If a beneficiary is receiving repetitive non-covered care, but the
> healthcare provider or supplier failed to issue an ABN before the
> first or the first few episodes of care were provided, the ABN may be
> issued at any time during the course of treatment. However, if the ABN
> is issued after repetitive treatment has been initiated, the ABN
> cannot be retroactively dated or used to shift liability to the
> beneficiary for care that had been provided before ABN issuance. In
> cases such as this, care that was provided before ABN delivery would
> be the financial responsibility of the healthcare provider or
> supplier.
>
> **B.Incomplete ABNs**
>
> Allegations of improper or incomplete notices will be investigated by
> Medicare\
> contractors. If the notifier is found to have given improper or
> incomplete notice, the applicable Medicare contractor will not hold
> the beneficiary liable in the individual case.
>
> **C.Electronic Issuance of the ABN**
>
> Electronic issuance of ABNs is not prohibited. If a healthcare
> provider or supplier elects to issue an ABN that is viewed on an
> electronic screen before signing, the beneficiary has the option of
> requesting paper issuance over electronic if that is what s/he
> prefers. Also, regardless of whether a paper or electronic version is
> issued and regardless of whether the signature is digitally captured
> or manually penned, the beneficiary should be given a paper copy of
> the signed ABN to keep for his/her own records.
>
> **50.8.1- Options for Delivery Other than In-Person**\
> **(Rev. 10862; Issued: 07-14-21; Effective: 10-14-21; Implementation:
> 10-14-21)**
>
> ABNs should be delivered in-person and prior to the delivery of
> medical care which is presumed to be non-covered. In circumstances
> when in-person delivery is not possible, notifiers may deliver an ABN
> using another method. Examples include:
>
> •Direct telephone contact;\
> •Mail;\
> •Secure fax machine; or\
> •Internet e-mail.
>
> All methods of delivery require adherence to all statutory privacy
> requirements under
>
> HIPAA. The notifier must receive a response from the beneficiary or
> his/her representative in order to validate delivery.
>
> When delivery is not in-person, the notifier must verify that contact
> was made in his/her records. In order to be considered effective, the
> beneficiary should not dispute such contact. Telephone contacts should
> be followed immediately by either a hand-delivered, mailed, emailed,
> or a faxed notice. The beneficiary should sign and retain the notice
> and send a copy of this signed notice to the notifier for retention in
> the patient's record.
>
> The notifier must keep a copy of the unsigned notice on file while
> awaiting receipt of the signed notice. If the beneficiary does not
> return a signed copy, the notifier should document the initial contact
> and subsequent attempts to obtain a signature in appropriate records
> or on the notice itself.

> **50.9 -Effects of Lack of Notification, Medicare Review and Claim
> Adjudication**\
> **(Rev. 10862; Issued: 07-14-21; Effective: 10-14-21; Implementation:
> 10-14-21)**
>
> **A. Beneficiary Liability**
>
> A beneficiary who has been given a properly delivered ABN and agrees
> to pay may be held liable. The charge may be the healthcare provider
> or supplier's usual and customary fee for that item or service and is
> not limited to the Medicare fee schedule. If the beneficiary does not

> ABN issuance is mandatory only when a beneficiary's covered ambulance
> transport is modified to a level that is not medically reasonable and
> necessary and will incur\
> additional costs. If an ambulance transport is statutorily excluded
> from coverage because it fails to meet Medicare's definition of the
> ambulance benefit, a voluntary ABN may be issued to notify the
> beneficiary of his/her financial liability as a courtesy.
>
> **D. Hospice**
>
> Mandatory use of the ABN is very limited for hospices. Hospice
> providers are\
> responsible for providing the ABN when required as listed below for
> items and services billable to hospice. Hospices are not responsible
> for issuing an ABN when a hospice patient seeks care outside of the
> hospice's jurisdiction.
>
> The three situations that would require issuance of the ABN by a
> hospice are:
>
> • Ineligibility because the beneficiary is not determined to be
> "terminally ill" as defined in §1879(g)(2) of the Act; or\
> • Specific items or services that are billed separately from the
> hospice payment, such as physician services, are not reasonable and
> necessary as defined in either\
> §1862(a)(1)(A) or §1862(a)(1)(C); or
>
> • The level of hospice care is determined to be not reasonable or
> medically necessary as defined in §1862(a)(1)(A) or §1862(a)(1)(C),
> specifically for the management of the terminal illness and/or related
> conditions.
>
> **Note:** It is the hospice's responsibility to issue an ABN when a
> beneficiary who has elected the hospice benefit chooses to receive
> inpatient hospice care in a hospital that is not under contract with
> the hospice. The hospice may delegate delivery of the ABN to the
> hospital in these cases.
>
> **End of all Medicare covered hospice care --**
>
> When it is determined that a beneficiary who has been receiving
> hospice care is no longer terminally ill and the beneficiary is going
> to be discharged from hospice, the hospice may be required to issue
> the Notice of Medicare Non-coverage (NOMNC), CMS 10123. If upon
> discharge the patient wants to continue receiving hospice care that
> will not be covered by Medicare, the hospice would issue an ABN to the
> beneficiary in order to transfer liability for the non-covered care to
> the beneficiary. If no further hospice services are provided after
> discharge, ABN issuance would not be required.
>
> ABNs are not required for Hospice Services in these situations:
>
> •**Revocations -** Hospice beneficiaries or their representatives can
> revoke the hospice benefit. Revocations are not considered
> terminations under liability notice policy since the beneficiary is
> exercising his/her own freedom of choice. Therefore, no ABN is
> required.
>
> •**Respite Care Beyond Five Consecutive Days -** Respite care is
> limited to five consecutive days under the Act. When respite care
> exceeds five consecutive days, an ABN is not required since additional
> days of respite care are not part of the hospice benefit. CMS
> encourages hospice providers to give the ABN as an optional notice to
> inform patients of financial liability when more than five days of
> respite care will be provided.
>
> •**Transfers -** Beneficiaries are allowed one transfer to another
> hospice during a benefit period. However, subsequent transfers within
> the same benefit period are not permitted. In either case, an ABN is
> not required.
>
> •**Failure to Meet the Face to Face Requirement -** The ABN must not
> be issued when the face to face requirement for hospice
> recertification is not met within the required timeframe. Failure to
> meet the face to face requirement for recertification should not be
> misrepresented as a determination that the beneficiary is no longer
> terminally ill.
>
> •**Room and Board Costs for Nursing Facility Residents -** Since room
> and board are not part of the hospice benefit, an ABN would not be
> required when the patient elects hospice and continues to pay out of
> pocket for long term care room and board.
>
> **E. Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF)**
>
> Since Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services
> are billed under Part B, CORF providers must issue the ABN according
> to the instructions given in this section. The ABN is issued by CORFs
> before providing a service that is usually covered by Medicare but may
> not be paid for in a specific case because it is not medically
> reasonable and necessary.
>
> When all Medicare covered CORF services are going to end, CORF's are
> required to
>
> issue a notice regarding the beneficiary's right to an expedited
> determination called a NOMNC, CMS 10123. Upon termination of all CORF
> care, the ABN would be issued only if the beneficiary wants to
> continue receiving some or all services that will not be covered by
> Medicare because they are no longer considered medically reasonable
> and necessary. An ABN would not be issued if no further CORF services
> are provided.

> \*If the beneficiary does not want the item or service that is being
> initiated, reduced, or terminated, no ABN is required.
>
> When an HHA performs an initial assessment of a beneficiary prior to
> admission but does not admit the beneficiary, an ABN is not required
> if there is no charge for the assessment.
>
> However, if an HHA charges for an assessment, the HHA must provide
> notice to the beneficiary before performing and charging for this
> service.
>
> Since Medicare has specific requirements for payment of home health
> services, there may be occasions where a payment requirement is not
> met, and therefore, the HHA expects that Medicare will not pay for the
> services. The HHA cannot use the ABN to transfer liability to the
> beneficiary when there is concern that a billing requirement may not
> be met. For example, a home health agency can't issue an ABN at
> initiation of home care services in order to charge the beneficiary if
> the healthcare provider face to face\
> encounter requirement is not met.
>
> When all Medicare covered home health care is terminated, HHAs may
> sometimes be required to deliver the NOMNC, CMS- 10123. The NOMNC
> informs beneficiaries of the right to an expedited determination by a
> Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) if they feel that termination
> of home health services is not appropriate. If a beneficiary requests
> a QIO review upon receiving a NOMNC, the QIO will make a fast decision
> on whether covered services should end. If the QIO decides that
> Medicare covered care should end and the patient wishes to continue
> receiving care from the HHA even though Medicare will not pay, an ABN
> must be issued to the beneficiary since this would be an initiation of
> non-covered care.
>
> **HHA Exceptions to ABN Notification Requirements**
>
> ABN issuance is NOT required in the following HHA situations:
>
> • initial assessments (in cases where beneficiaries are not admitted)
> for which HHAs do not charge;
>
> • care that is never covered by Medicare under any circumstances
> (i.e., an HHA offers complimentary hearing aid cleaning and
> maintenance);
>
> • telehealth monitoring used as an adjunct to regular covered HH care;
> or
>
> • non-covered items/services that are part of care covered in total
> under a Medicare bundled payment (e.g., HH prospective payment system
> (PPS) episode payment).

> **60.1 - Background on the HHCCN**\
> **(Rev. 2781, Issued: 09-06-13, Effective: 12-09-13, Implementation:
> 12-09-13)**
>
> HHAs have issued HHABNs related to the absence or cessation of
> Medicare coverage when a beneficiary had liability protection under
> §1879 of the Social Security Act (the Act) since 2002. The HHABN
> gained additional notification capabilities in 2006 following the U.S.
> Court of Appeals (2nd Circuit) decision in [Lutwin v.
> Thompson,]{.underline}361 F.3d 146; 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS
> 3774.Following [Lutwin]{.underline}, the HHABN was modified so
>
> that it could also be used by HHAs to notify beneficiaries receiving
> home health services of any care changes in accordance with the HHA
> conditions of participation (COPs) in §1891 of the Act.
>
> To account for this expanded use, the HHABN was revised to contain
> three\
> interchangeable Option Boxes within the body of the notice designated
> as Option Box 1, Option Box 2, and Option Box 3. Option Box 1 language
> was applicable to situations involving potential beneficiary liability
> for HHA services as directed by §1879 of the Act. Option Box 2 or
> Option Box 3 was inserted into the HHABN form to notify beneficiaries
> of changes in a home health plan of care that are subject to the
> requirements of § 1891 of the Act.
>
> In order to streamline, reduce, and simplify notices issued to
> Medicare beneficiaries, the HHABN is being discontinued. HHABN, Option
> Box 1, which is the liability portion of the notice, is replaced by
> the existing Advance Beneficiary Notice of Noncoverage (ABN),
> CMS-R-131. The change of care notification portions of the HHABN,
> Option Box 2 and Option Box 3, is replaced by the newly approved
> HHCCN.
>
> **60.2 - Scope of the HHCCN**\
> **(Rev. 2781, Issued: 09-06-13, Effective: 12-09-13, Implementation:
> 12-09-13)**
>
> **A. Statutory Authorization for HHCCN**
>
> The requirement to give an HHCCN is based on the HHA COPs in §1891 of
> the Act. The COPs are further implemented through Title 42 of the Code
> of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 484.
>
> §1891(a)(1)(E) stipulates that beneficiaries have:
>
> "The right to be fully informed orally and in writing (in advance of
> coming under the care of the \[home health\] agency) of --
>
> all items and services furnished by (or under arrangement with) the
> agency for which payment may be made under this title,
>
> the coverage available for such items and services under this title,
> title XIX or any other Federal program of which the agency is

> any charges for items and services not covered under this title and

> services furnished by (or under arrangement with) the agency, and
>
> any changes in the charges or items and services described in clause
> (i), (ii) or (iii)."
>
> HHAs are required to use the HHCCN to notify the beneficiary of
> reductions and terminations in health care in accordance with Medicare
> COPs.
>
> **B. HHAs and Other CMS Notices**
>
> HHAs will now use the Advanced Beneficiary Notice (ABN), Form
> CMS-R-131 for liability notification instead of the HHABN Option
> Box 1. The ABN and form instructions can be downloaded from the CMS

> **C. HHCCN Issuers and Recipients**
>
> HHAs are the only type of Medicare provider that issues the HHCCN to
> notify the beneficiary of care changes involving reductions or
> terminations of items and/or services.
>
> The recipients of the HHCCN are beneficiaries enrolled in Original
> Medicare only.
>
> HHCCNs are not used in Medicare managed care. When a beneficiary
> transitions to Medicare managed care from Original Medicare during a
> home health episode, HHCCN issuance is required only if there is a
> specific need to provide notification of changes in care as the
> transfer occurs.
>
> Subcontractors may deliver HHCCNs under the direction of a primary
> HHA; however, notification responsibility, including effective
> delivery, always rests with the primary HHA. HHAs are always
> responsible for providing HHCCNs associated with the care that they
> provide. In the form instructions and instructions in this section,
> the term\
> "beneficiary" is used to mean the beneficiary or the beneficiary\'s
> representative, as applicable. For more information on
> representatives, see §40.3.5 and §40.3.4.3 of this chapter.
>
> HHAs should contact their CMS Regional Office if they have questions
> on the HHCCN or related instructions. Beneficiaries who need
> assistance may be directed to call 1-800-MEDICARE.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Reduction**\                    | > When an HHA reduces or stops an |
| of a service                      | > item and/or service during a    |
|                                   | > spell of illness while          |

+===================================+===================================+
| **Termination**\                  | > When an HHA ends delivery of    |
| of all services                   | > all services.                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

> **A. Reductions**
>
> Reductions involve any decrease in items and/or services, such as
> frequency, amount, or level of care, provided by the HHA. When care
> that is listed on the POC or provided by the HHA is reduced, the
> beneficiary must receive the HHCCN listing the items/services being
> reduced and the reason for the reduction, regardless of who is
> responsible for paying for that service.
>
> When a reduction occurs because the HHA decides to stop providing the
> service for administrative reasons or because of a physician's order,
> the HHCCN must be issued.
>
> **Example 1** -- Reduction for HHA reasons:
>
> Because of a temporary staffing shortage, an HHA reduces daily
> physical therapy (PT) to PT 3 times weekly for 2 weeks.
>
> The HHCCN must be issued to the beneficiary prior to this care
> reduction that is due to an agency administration issue.
>
> **Example 2** --Reduction based on physician's orders:
>
> The beneficiary met PT goals sooner than expected, and the attending
> physician writes an order to discontinue home PT. Physical therapy
> services are\
> discontinued with no change in existing skilled nursing orders.
>
> The HHCCN must be issued to the beneficiary prior to this care
> reduction that is a change to the existing POC because of a
> physician's order. Reductions include cases, such as this, where one
> type of care ends, but the beneficiary continues to receive another
> type of home health service.
>
> An ABN is issued (and not the HHCCN) if a reduction occurs for an item
> or service that will no longer be covered by Medicare but the
> beneficiary wants to continue to receive the care and assume the
> financial charges. See Section 50.15.4.
>
> **B. Terminations**
>
> A termination is the cessation of all services provided by the HHA and
> can include Medicare covered and noncovered care. When all home health
> care is ending for reasons not related to Medicare coverage, the HHA
> issues the HHCCN with information appropriate to the specific
> situation.
>
> **Example 1** -- care termination due to agency reasons (such as
> staffing, closure of the HHA, concerns for staff safety), not related
> to Medicare coverage.
>
> An HHA decides to stop providing care because guard dogs at the home
> where the care is being furnished have posed safety issues for staff.
>
> Because termination is due to an HHA administrative decision, the
> HHCCN must be given to the beneficiary prior to discontinuation of
> services.
>
> **Example 2** -- care termination due to agency reasons (failure to
> meet face to face encounter requirement)
>
> An HHA has initiated care for a beneficiary, and the beneficiary has
> not yet had the required face to face encounter with the certifying
> physician or an allowed non-physician practitioner (NPP). The HHA
> believes that the face to face encounter requirement will not be met
> in the allowed time frame and decides to stop providing care.
>
> This termination is due to an HHA administrative decision; thus, the
> HHCCN must be given to the beneficiary prior to discontinuation of
> services. Issuing the HHCCN does not affect financial liability but
> serves as a written change of care notice as required by the HHA COPs.
>
> **Example 3** -- care termination due to a physician's orders to
> discontinue care or a lack of orders to continue care
>
> A physician orders discontinuation of all home health services or
> fails to order continued home health services.
>
> The Notice of Medicare Provider Non-Coverage (NOMNC), CMS-10123 must
> be issued to the beneficiary when all Medicare covered services are
> ending based on the\
> physician's orders. Since the NOMNC provides written notification of
> the forthcoming termination of all home health care, it satisfies the
> regulatory requirement for change of care advisement (HHCCN issuance).
> Thus, when the NOMNC is issued as required, the HHA doesn't have to
> issue a separate HHCCN. When home health services end because of
> physician's orders, HHAs have the option of issuing the NOMNC alone or
> both the NOMNC and the HHCCN.
>
> Detailed information and instructions for issuing the NOMNC can be
> found on the CMS website at:
>
> **C. Effect of Other Insurers/Payers**
>
> HHCCN requirements apply only when home health services are expected
> to be partially or fully covered by Medicare. When a beneficiary is
> not receiving any services that are
>
> expected to be covered under the Medicare home health benefit, the
> HHCCN is not required. For example, if a dual eligible beneficiary
> (having both Medicare and\
> Medicaid) is not receiving any Medicare covered home health services,
> HHCCN issuance wouldn't be required when changes of care occur.
> (**NOTE:** HHAs are required to issue the ABN to dual eligible
> beneficiaries when applicable. See Section 50.15.4 C)
>
> **D. Exceptions to HHCCN Notification Requirements**
>
> The HHCCN is NOT required when changes in care involve:
>
> •increase in care;
>
> •changes in HHA caregivers or personnel as decided by the HHA;
>
> •changes in expected arrival or departure time for HHA staff as
> determined by the HHA;
>
> •changes in brand of product, ( i.e., the same item produced by a
> different manufacturer) as determined by the HHA;
>
> •change in the duration of services that has been included in the POC
> and communicated to the beneficiary by the HHA, ( i.e., shorter
> therapy sessions as health status improves, such as a reduction from
> an hour to 45 minutes);
>
> •lessening the number of items or services in cases where a range of
> services is included in the POC;
>
> **Example:** The POC order states: PT 3-5x per week as needed for gait
> training. The therapist begins therapy at 5 times per week, and as the
> patient progresses, therapy is reduced to 3 times per week. No HHCCN
> would be needed in this case.
>
> •changes in the mix of services delivered in a specific discipline
> (e.g., skilled nursing) with no decrease in frequency with which that
> discipline is delivered;
>
> **Example:** A beneficiary is receiving several skilled nursing
> services during visits that are scheduled 3 times a week. One service
> within that discipline, a blood draw 1 time a week, is discontinued.
> Other skilled nursing services (wound care and education) continue,
> such that skilled nursing visits continue to occur 3 times per week.
> No HHCCN is required when the blood draws are discontinued, only when
> skilled nursing is reduced in frequency.
>
> •changes in the modality affecting supplies employed as part of
> specific treatment (e.g., wound care) with no decrease in the
> frequency with which those supplies are provided; or
>
> **Example:** A specific wound care product like Alldress is stopped,
> and a Hydrogel pad is started. Since this represents a change in the
> modality (or intervention) and not a reduction, no HHCCN is necessary.
>
> •changes in care that are the beneficiary's decision and are
> documented in the medical record.
>
> **60.4 - Completing the HHCCN**\
> **(Rev. 2781, Issued: 09-06-13, Effective: 12-09-13, Implementation:
> 12-09-13)**
>
> **A. Notices and General Notice Requirements**
>
> The HHCCN and the general instructions for preparing the HHCCN are
> available for download at the home health notice link found at
>
> The notice is available in English and Spanish, and in PDF and Word
> formats. The HHCCN is the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
> approved standard notice for use by Medicare HHAs to inform
> beneficiaries of changes in the POC when required by the COPs for
> HHAs. HHAs must use the OMB approved standard notice. HHAs must not
> add any customizations to the notice beyond what is permitted by the
> accompanying HHCCN form instructions and the guidelines published in
> this section.
>
> **B. Choosing the Correct Language Version**
>
> HHAs should choose the appropriate version of the HHCCN based on the
> language the beneficiary best understands. When a Spanish-language
> HHCCN is used, the HHA should make insertions on the notice in
> Spanish. If this is impossible, the HHA must take additional steps
> needed to assure beneficiary comprehension and document this on the
> HHCCN.
>
> If needed, HHAs must provide verbal assistance in other languages to
> assist beneficiaries in understanding the document. HHAs should
> document any types of translation assistance used in the "Additional
> Information" section of the notice.
>
> **C. Compliance with Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995**
>
> Consistent with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the valid OMB
> control number for this information collection appearing on the HHCCN
> is 0938-1196. The estimated time required to complete this information
> collection is 4 minutes for a single notice. This includes the time to
> prepare the notice, review it with the beneficiary, and obtain the
> beneficiary's signature.
>
> **D. Effective Dates**
>
> HHCCNs are effective for HHA use per the OMB assigned date given at
> the bottom of each notice unless CMS instructs HHAs otherwise. The
> routine approval is for 3-year
>
> use. HHAs are expected to exclusively use the effective version of the
> HHCCN per CMS directives.
>
> **60.5 - HHCCN Delivery**\
> **(Rev. 2781, Issued: 09-06-13, Effective: 12-09-13, Implementation:
> 12-09-13)**
>
> HHAs must make every effort to ensure beneficiaries understand the
> entire HHCCN prior to signing it. When delivering HHCCNs, HHAs are
> required to explain the notice and its content, and answer beneficiary
> questions to the best of their ability. If abbreviations are used, the
> HHA should explain their meaning to the beneficiary. If the
> beneficiary requests additional information while completing the
> HHCCN, the HHA must respond timely, accurately, and completely to the
> information request.
>
> While in-person delivery of the HHCCN is preferable, it is not
> required consistent with general ABN requirements, see Medicare Claims
> Processing Manual, Chapter 30, §40.3.4.1.
>
> If a mode other than in person delivery is used, the HHA must adhere
> to the requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and
> Accountability Act (HIPAA). Instructions on ABN telephone notice found
> in §40.3.4.2 of this chapter are also applicable to HHCCNs.
>
> **Delivery when change of care is due to agency administrative
> reasons**
>
> The HHA should review the text associated with the box that was
> checked on the HHCCN by the HHA and verbally explain to the
> beneficiary that he/she may be able to obtain the same or similar care
> from another HHA, since coverage through Medicare is not affected.
> HHAs are encouraged to do as much as possible to offer ideas to\
> beneficiaries for contacting other HHAs and must inform ordering
> physicians of reductions/terminations consistent with the COPs for
> HHAs.
>
> **Delivery when change of care is due to physician orders**
>
> The HHA should review the text associated with the box that was
> checked on the HHCCN by the HHA, and inform the beneficiary that the
> HHA will no longer provide certain care because the physician's order
> has changed. When requested, the HHA may facilitate contact and
> understanding between the physician and beneficiary. The beneficiary
> may also seek to contact the physician directly.
>
> **Retention of the HHCCN**
>
> The HHA keeps a copy of the completed, signed or annotated HHCCN in
> the\
> beneficiary's record, and the beneficiary receives a copy. HHA's may
> retain a scanned copy of the paper copy document in an electronic
> medical record if desired. The primary HHA must retain the HHCCN if a
> subcontractor is used.
>
> Applicable retention periods are discussed in Chapter 1 of this
> manual, §110. In general, this is 5 years from discharge when there
> are no other applicable requirements under State law.
>
> **Other Considerations During Completion**
>
> **1. Beneficiary Unable to Sign**
>
> If the beneficiary is physically unable to sign the HHCCN and is fully
> capable of understanding the notice a representative is not required
> for signature. The beneficiary may allow the HHA to annotate the HHCCN
> on his/her behalf regarding this\
> circumstance. For example, a fully cognizant beneficiary with two
> broken hands may allow an HHA staff person to sign and date the notice
> in the presence of and under the direction of the beneficiary,
> inserting the beneficiary's name along with his/her own name, i.e.,
> "John Smith, Shiny HHA, signing for Jane Doe." Such signatures should
> be witnessed by a second person whenever possible. Further, the
> medical record should support the beneficiary's inability to write in
> the applicable time period.
>
> **2. Timely Notice**
>
> There are no exact time frames for HHCCN delivery. Delivery timing of
> the notice may sometimes occur immediately upon the HHA finding that a
> change in care is warranted.
>
> However, in general, HHCCN should be delivered far enough in advance
> of the care change so that the beneficiary may pursue alternatives to
> continue receiving the care noted on the HHCCN. When plans for
> issuance of the notice are known in advance, the HHCCN should not be
> issued so far in advance as to cause confusion regarding the
> information it conveys.
>
> Some allowance is made for "immediate" delivery prior to furnishing
> the care at issue when unforeseen circumstances arise such as an
> impending, unforeseen agency staffing shortage or a dangerous home
> situation. This should be avoided whenever possible, but is
> permissible when a situation occurs prompting an immediate
> determination to reduce or end services that could not have been made
> in advance.
>

> **B. Effect of Other Insurers/Payers**
>
> Some States have specific rules established regarding completion of
> liability notices in situations where dual-eligibles need to accept
> liability for Medicare non-covered care that will be covered by
> Medicaid. Medicaid has the authority to make this assertion under
> Title XIX of the Act, where Medicaid is recognized as the "payer of
> last resort", meaning other Federal programs like Medicare (Title
> XVIII) must pay in accordance with their own policies before Medicaid
> picks up any remaining charges. If the patient is a Medicare-Medicaid
> dual-eligible and a triggering event occurs, the SNF needs to give the
> beneficiary a SNF ABN.
>
> On a practical basis, physician-prescribed items or services continue
> without interruption or reduction when a patient changes "payer
> eligibility" from Medicare to Medicaid. From the Medicare coverage
> vantage-point, however, there is a reduction or termination when
> Medicare, which has been paying, stops paying. In other words, there
> is a\
> triggering event, which underlies the change in "payer eligibility."
> In these instances, a SNF ABN must be issued to transfer financial
> liability to the beneficiary.

>
> SNFs need not issue a SNF ABN to transfer financial liability to the
> beneficiary:
>
> •If the extended care item or service is not a Medicare benefit (e.g.,
> personal comfort items excluded under §1862(a)(6)).
>
> •If a beneficiary is being furnished post-hospital extended care

> Medicare covered benefit because it does not meet a technical benefit
>
> requirement (e.g., SNF stay not preceded by the required prior
> three-day
>
> hospital stay or the beneficiary is exhausting his/her 100 benefit
> days).
>
> •If Medicare is expected to deny payment for Part B covered medical
> and other health services which the SNF furnishes, either directly or

> with others, to an inpatient of the SNF, where payment for these

>
> of illness or was determined to be receiving a non-covered level of

>
> •If the SNF will not furnish the extended care items or services. A

>
> ABN. This rule also applies when the beneficiary agrees with the

>
> event (i.e., terminating therapy) and the beneficiary will not be
> receiving the
>
> extended care items or services.
>
> **NOTE:** This rule is not applicable in the situation where the

> refuses to sign the SNF ABN attesting to being personally and fully
> responsible for payment, in which case, the SNF may then consider not

>
> When completing and delivering the SNF ABN, SNFs must meet the written
> notice standards in §50.6 and 50.7 of this chapter, unless otherwise
> specified. Failure to provide a proper SNF ABN in situations where a
> physician has ordered the extended care item or service may result in
> the SNF being held financially liable under the LOL provisions, where
> such provisions apply. SNFs may also be sanctioned for violating the
> conditions of participation regarding resident (beneficiary) rights.
>
> **NOTE:** The SNF ABN is not a replacement for, but is in addition to,
> the required UR entity notices**.** The SNF ABN protects the SNF from
> liability in the event the\
> beneficiary, for some reason, does not receive the UR entity notice.
>
> **70.5 -Special Rules for SNF ABNs**\
> **(Rev.: 4198; Issued: 01-11-19; Effective: 04-30-18; Implementation:
> 04-30-18)**
>
> **A. Collection from Beneficiary**
>
> When a SNF ABN is properly executed and given timely to a beneficiary
> and Medicare denies payment on the related claim, the SNF must wait
> for the beneficiary to receive a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) before
> it can collect payment on the related claim. Medicare does not limit
> the amount that the SNF may collect from the beneficiary in such a
> situation. A beneficiary's agreement to "be personally and fully
> responsible for payment" means that the beneficiary agrees to pay out
> of pocket or through any other insurance that the beneficiary may
> have, e.g., through employer group health plan coverage, through
> Medicaid, or through some other Federal or non-Federal payment source.
>
> **NOTE:** The beneficiary may request a demand bill at any point in
> her or his care.
>
> **B. Unbundling Prohibition**
>
> The SNF ABNs may not be used to shift financial liability to a
> beneficiary in the case of services for which full payment is bundled
> into other payments; that is, where the beneficiary would otherwise
> not be financially liable for payment for an extended care item or
> service because Medicare made a bundled payment. Using a SNF ABN to
> collect
>
> from a beneficiary where full payment is made on a bundled basis would
> constitute double billing. A SNF ABN may be used to shift financial
> liability to a beneficiary in the case of extended care items or
> services for which partial payment is bundled into other payments;
> that is, where part of the cost is not included in the bundled payment
> made by Medicare.
>
> **C. Acceptance or Rejection of SNF ABN**
>
> These instructions are to assist the Medicare contractor in advising
> SNFs with respect to their responsibilities in advising beneficiaries
> with respect to their rights and protections and in dealing with
> complaints from beneficiaries, or authorized representatives, about
> the lack of notice or defective notice. The SNF should:
>
> •Answer inquiries from a beneficiary regarding the basis for the
> SNF's, the UR entity's, the QIO's, or the Medicare contractor's
> assessment that extended care
>
> items or services may not be covered and, if requested by the
> beneficiary, the SNF must give the beneficiary access to medical
> record information or other

documents upon which these entities based their assessment, to the
extent

> permissible or required under applicable state law.
>
> **NOTE:** Where state law prohibits such direct disclosure, the SNF
> should advise
>
> a beneficiary who has requested access to such information how to
> obtain that information from the SNF once a demand bill has been
> submitted.
>
> •Respond timely, accurately, and completely to a beneficiary who
> requests information about the extent of the beneficiary's personal
> financial liability.
>
> •Timely submit additional information to the Medicare contractor, if a
> beneficiary or a physician provides that additional information with
> respect to Medicare

> coverage of the subject extended care items or services.

>
> **B. The UR entity of the SNF that is furnishing non-covered extended

>
> **Example:**
>
> • The UR entity timely furnishes to the beneficiary a SNF ABN
> notifying the beneficiary that the extended care item(s) or service(s)

>
> **C. The QIO or Medicare contractor.**
>
> **Example:**
>
> • The QIO, where a beneficiary is in a swing bed, timely furnishes to

> is no longer covered.
>
> **NOTE:** This occurs after the beneficiary receives a HINN 1\

>
> A beneficiary or any person(s) who assumed financial responsibility
> for payment is indemnified for claims filed if all of the following

>
> • The contractor has determined that the beneficiary is without
> liability under authority of [§1879]{.underline} of the Act for items

>
> • The contractor or the QIO has determined that the provider,

> beneficiary. A provider, practitioner, or supplier is considered to
> have knowledge that payment will not be made under Medicare for items
> or services in a particular claim where the following evidence is
> established regarding the provider,\
> practitioner, or supplier;
>
> \(1\) Evidence that a provider, practitioner, or supplier knew, or
> could reasonably be expected to have known, of exclusion of items or
> services
>
> o General notice to the medical community regarding exclusion of
> certain items or services: e.g., colonic irrigation, acupuncture.
>
> o General notice to the medical community that services exceeding
> certain frequencies would be denied or subject to additional review,
> e.g., vitamin B12 injections, or nursing home visits more frequent
> than once a month.
>
> o Written notice to the particular provider, practitioner, or supplier
> that a type of service or item would be noncovered in all or certain
> circumstances.
>
> A distinction must be maintained between coverage rules that specify
> that a type of service or item would be not reasonable or necessary in
> all or certain\
> circumstances, and utilization guidelines the contractor established
> to identify excessive services. Any written policies or other internal
> edits that are disclosed to a provider, practitioner, or supplier
> would not be considered as a "notice" of exclusion, since they are
> used for referring claims for further development rather than as rules
> to make a contractor coverage decision.
>
> In addition to instances when the Medicare program has given notice,
> the\
> allegation of a provider, practitioner, or supplier is not accepted
> without further verification in situations of potential program abuse
> involving a pattern of unnecessary services by a provider,
> practitioner, or supplier to a number of beneficiaries. When a
> provider, practitioner, or supplier frequently renders unnecessary
> services, i.e., services that significantly exceed the frequency with
> which the general medical community renders them, it is reasonable to
> expect the provider, practitioner, or supplier to know that such a
> pattern deviates from the standard practice.
>
> \(2\) Evidence that provider, practitioner, or supplier did not have
> knowledge of exclusion of services.
>
> In contrast to subsection 1, there may be situations where an
> assumption can be made that neither the beneficiary nor the provider,
> practitioner, or supplier had
>
> knowledge of exclusion, and liability can be limited by the reviewer
> without a statement by either party. In the following situations,
> further development would not be necessary:
>
> a\. The service is for a type of treatment that can be rendered only
> by a\
> physician, but the contractor has not previously denied payment for
> the treatment, and it is not unreasonable that a particular physician
> might consider the treatment appropriate. In order to determine
> whether the services are reasonable and necessary, the contractor
> requests its physician consultant or CMS to advise whether the
> services are covered. This is a case for which there are no general
> coverage guidelines for the services; the contractor has not advised
> either the physician or the medical\
> community regarding the coverage of the services; and the contractor
> is uncertain without expert consultation. In such a case, it may be
> presumed that neither the beneficiary nor the physician could have
> known that the services would be noncovered.
>
> b\. The item or service is ordinarily covered, but a question is
> raised as to whether it is reasonable and necessary in treatment of a
> particular\
> diagnosis. Neither the provider, practitioner, or supplier nor the
> medical community has been advised that the item or service is not
> covered for that diagnosis. The case requires a determination by the
> contractor's medical consultant or is referred to CMS for guidance. As
> in example (a), the liability of both parties should be limited.
>
> c\. The provider, practitioner, or supplier is newly arrived in the
> contractor service area, and the contractor has not yet communicated
> to the provider, practitioner, or supplier information in an existing
> general notice that the item or service is not covered, always or
> under certain circumstances.
>
> **NOTE:** If any provider, practitioner, or supplier could reasonably
> be expected, by virtue of normal medical knowledge, to know that the
> service was unneeded, the presumption suggested in the above examples
> would not apply.

> provider or physician/supplier of the proposed indemnification action.
> (A sample letter for these situations is contained in §100.10, Exhibit

> •A statement of the provision ofwhich allows the program to indemnify

>
> A - Initial Claims
>
> In implementing the limitation on liability provision, the contractor
> makes a coverage decision before making a limitation on liability
> decision. Section [1879]{.underline} of the Act provides that
> limitation on liability can be allowed only in cases:
>
> Where - (1) a determination is made that, by reason of [§1862(a)(l) or

> Part B of this title for any expenses incurred for items or services
> furnished an individual by a provider of services\... (Section
> 1879(a)(1) of the Social Security Act.)
>
> **NOTE:** Subsection (g) refers to home health service denials under
> [§§1814(a)(2)(C)]{.underline} and [1835(a)(2)(A)]{.underline}, i.e.,
> the patient is or was not confined to home; or the patient does or did
> not need skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis; and to hospice
> denials under §1861(dd)(3)(A) for services determined to be noncovered
> because the beneficiary was not "terminally ill".
>
> Only after the contractor makes a decision that care is not reasonable
> or necessary, is custodial, is not reasonable and necessary for the
> palliation or management of terminal illness in hospice denials, or
> does not meet the homebound or intermittent nursing care requirements
> in home health service denials, or does not meet the "terminally ill"
> condition for hospice care, should a determination be made regarding
> limitation on liability. In every such case there will be two parts to
> the limitation on liability determination:
>
> 1.Whether and when the beneficiary knew or should have known that the
> services were noncovered, and
>
> 2.Whether and when the provider knew or should have known that the

>
> In any case where the provider gave the beneficiary notice that the
> services would be noncovered, the contractor will find that the
> provider knew that the services were noncovered.
>
> B -- Redetermination

> At the redetermination level, again the contractor first makes a

> It appears that you did not know that we would not pay for this

>
> **A.** Generally, notifiers (physicians, practitioners, suppliers,

> (CMS-R-131) to their Medicare contractor along with their claims (see
> §50.6.3). This is based on a rebuttable administrative presumption

> signify that notifiers are using the proper standard form CMS-R-131
> and are preparing and delivering ABNs in compliance with the
> instructions in this Chapter.
>
> **B.** Contractors may and should request CMS-R-131 ABNs (or any other
> ABN if the circumstances demand) be submitted to them for review in
> any circumstance in which the contractor is not confident that the
> administrative presumption is correct or in which the contractor has
> good reason to examine the ABNs of either particular notifiers or any
> class of notifiers. In the case where a contractor requests submission
> of copies of ABNs, the notifiers must submit such copies (see
> §50.6.3).
>
> **C.** All Hospital ABNs (HINNs) will be reviewed by QIOs (see §80.5)
> and all HHABNs and SNFABNs will be reviewed when the contractor
> performs complex medical review of the demand bills.

>
> Circumstances involving ABNs (viz., with respect to claims on which
> there is any payment denial, that include either or both the GA
> modifier and occurrence code 32, and that do not include a copy of the
> ABN) in which the contractor should not be confident that the
> administrative presumption, viz., that notifiers are using the proper
> form and are properly preparing and delivering ABNs, is correct and
> should request submission of ABNs include, but are not limited to, the
> following:
>
> **A.** Any claim where the contractor has any indication that the
> notifier may not have given proper notice, either no notice at all or
> defective notice, whether based on the contractor's experience (with
> the notifier or class of notifiers, or with the class of items or
> services), on beneficiary complaint, on any other plausible
> allegation, or on any other reasonable basis. (Contractors, of course,
> may not make baseless or capricious requests for routine submission of
> ABNs.)
>
> **B.** Any claim for payment for more than one item or service. (In
> such cases, the contractor must ascertain which item(s) and/or
> service(s) the ABN specified and, therefore, to which claimed item(s)
> and/or service(s) the ABN applies with respect to assigning liability
> to the beneficiary. Liability is shifted to the beneficiary only if
> the
>
> ABN accurately specifies the items or services and if the specified
> expected reason for denial turns out to be the actual reason for
> denial.)
>
> **C.** Any claim for an item or service for which there is a coverage
> frequency limit, and which includes one or more other items or
> services which are not frequency-limited.
>
> (Since ABNs may be given routinely for frequency-limited items and
> services, it is predictable that virtually all claims which include
> any frequency-limited item or service will include the GA modifier
> and/or occurrence code 32. When other, non-frequency-limited items or
> services are included on such a claim, any ABN specifying a
> frequency-limit as the expected reason for denial would not be
> applicable to the liability\
> determination with respect to any item or service on such a claim that

> frequency-limited item or service.)
>
> **D.** Any claim for an item or service for which there is a coverage
> frequency limit and on which there is a payment denial on any basis
> other than exceeding the frequency limit. (Since the notifier can be
> reasonably expected to have given routine notice on the basis of the
> frequency limit, and since an ABN specifying a frequency-limit as the
> expected reason for denial would not be applicable to the liability
> determination with respect to any item or service on such a claim that
> is denied on any basis other than that particular frequency limit,
> such ABNs need to be reviewed for their correct application to any

> The following sections discuss the relationship of these requirements
> to the limitation on liability provision.
>
> **A. Three-Day Prior Hospitalization**
>
> Before Medicare can pay for post-hospital extended care services, it
> must determine whether the beneficiary had a prior qualifying hospital
> stay of at least three consecutive calendar days. When a beneficiary's
> liability for a hospital stay is waived, the hospital days to which
> the limitation on liability applies **cannot** be used to satisfy the
> 3-day prior hospitalization requirement, since the services rendered
> during the days in question were found noncovered because they were
> not considered reasonable and necessary or because they constituted
> custodial care. (See "Coverage of Extended Care (SNF) Services Under
> Hospital Insurance," Chapter 8, of the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual
> for determining whether the 3-day prior hospitalization requirement is
> met.) If a beneficiary's hospital stay was partially covered, the A/B
> MAC (A) considers the covered portion of the stay in determining
> whether the SNF prior hospitalization requirement is met.
>
> **B. Transfer Requirements**
>
> **1. Transfer Period**
>
> The A/B MAC (A) applies the limitation on liability provision where it
> determines that all the SNF care received during the period serving to
> satisfy the transfer requirements described in "Coverage of Extended
> Care Services Under Hospital Insurance," Chapter 8 of the Medicare
> Benefit Policy Manual, either constituted custodial care or was not
> reasonable and necessary.
>
> Where the A/B MAC (A) determines that only the beneficiary's liability
> can be waived, the limitation on liability applies through the date of
> the notice to the beneficiary including any inpatient days beyond the
> transfer period. If the provider is also entitled to limitation on
> liability and program payment is possible under the limitation on
> liability provision, such payment is appropriate through the date of
> the notice and, if the A/B MAC (A) determines that additional time is
> needed to arrange for post-discharge care, for up to 24 hours after
> the date of notice to the provider or the beneficiary, whichever is
> earlier. If the A/B MAC (A) determines that even more time is needed
> to arrange post-discharge care, up to 24 additional hours may be paid
> for. (See §50.)
>
> Where a beneficiary who is entitled to limitation on liability starts
> to require and receives reasonable and necessary or noncustodial
> services only **after** the expiration of the SNF transfer period, the
> beneficiary nevertheless may have his/her liability waived for days
> where such services were rendered, in addition to those days waived
> during the noncovered transfer period **but only through the date of
> notice to the beneficiary**. If the provider is also entitled to
> limitation on liability, program payment may be made under the
> limitation on liability provision through the date of notice of
>
> noncoverage and, if the A/B MAC (A) determines that additional time is
> needed to arrange for post-discharge care, for a "grace period" of l
> day thereafter. If the A/B MAC (A) determines that even more time is
> needed to arrange post-discharge care, 1 additional "grace period" day
> may be paid for. (See §50.) This payment is made because it is
> inequitable to waive liability for noncovered services rendered during
> the transfer period but not for a period thereafter (prior to notice)
> during which the beneficiary needed and received an otherwise covered
> level of care.
>
> **2. Delayed Transfer Due to Medical Appropriateness**
>
> The law also provides for an extension of the usual 30-day time limit
> for transfer where the patient's condition makes it medically
> appropriate. ("Coverage of Extended Care Services Under Hospital
> Insurance," in the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 8.)
> However, if the A/B MAC (A) determines that such an extension is not
> allowable because an interval of more than 30 days for transfer to a
> SNF was not medically appropriate, it denies the SNF services because
> the transfer requirement was not met. The limitation on liability
> provision is not applicable in such a case.

> **B. Provider Notice Requirements**
>
> When a SNF or hospital places a patient in a noncertified or
> inappropriately certified portion of the institution because it
> believes the patient does not require a covered level of care, or for
> any other reason, it must notify the patient (or authorized
> representative) in writing that services in a noncertified or
> inappropriately certified bed are not covered.
>
> The provider uses the appropriate notice specified in70 for SNFs or
> swing beds,80 for inpatient hospitals, to advise the beneficiary of
> its decision to place him/her in a\
> noncertified bed, using language such as:
>
> We are placing you in a part of the institution that is not
> appropriately certified by Medicare because (you do not require a
> level of care that will qualify as skilled nursing care/or covered
> hospital services under Medicare)/(or state any other reasons for the
> noncertified bed placement). Nonqualifying services furnished a
> patient in a noncertified or inappropriately certified bed are not
> payable by Medicare. However, you may request us to file a claim for
> Medicare benefits.
>
> Based on this claim, Medicare will make a formal determination and
> advise whether any benefits are payable to you.
>
> (For related general billing requirements, see Chapter 1,60 of this
> manual, or other chapters specific to the benefit being billed:
> Chapter 3 for inpatient hospitals and swing beds, Chapter 6 for swing
> bed PPS and inpatient SNFs, and Chapter 7 for outpatient SNFs.)
>
> **C. Determining Beneficiary Consent**
>
> The CMS presumes that the beneficiary did not consent to being placed
> in a noncertified bed. In order to rebut the presumption of lack of
> consent, the provider must indicate on the bill the date it provided
> the beneficiary with an ABN notifying the beneficiary that the
> accommodations would no longer be covered; and requested the
> beneficiary's signed acknowledgement (on the ABN) of having received
> such a statement. Moreover, in any case in which a Medicare
> beneficiary gives his/her consent to placement in a noncertified bed,
> the provider must, if requested by the A/B MAC (A) (contemplated only
> at an appeal level of claim processing), submit a copy of the ABN
> signed by the beneficiary to the A/B MAC (A), for a determination of
> the ABN's validity. The ABN must be signed by the beneficiary
> (provided he/she is competent to give such consent) or by the\
> beneficiary's authorized representative. If the beneficiary or his/her
> authorized\
> representative refuses to sign the form, the provider may annotate the
> file to indicate it presented the ABN to the beneficiary (or his/her
> authorized representative), but the beneficiary refused to sign. As
> long as the provider's ABN notifies the beneficiary of the likely
> Medicare noncoverage, the beneficiary's refusal to sign the ABN does
> not render it invalid. (See §40.3.4.6.) If any of the above
> requirements is not met, the A/B MAC (A) automatically determines the
> ABN is defective.
>
> When the A/B MAC (A) receives a claim with an indication that the
> provider has provided the beneficiary or his/her authorized
> representative, with an ABN, the A/B MAC (A) denies the claim and
> notifies the beneficiary that §1879 limitation on liability cannot be
> applied because of the beneficiary's valid consent to be cared for in
> a noncertified or inappropriately certified bed. If the A/B MAC (A)
> determines that the ABN is not valid, the A/B MAC (A) processes the
> claim in accordance with §130.4.
>
> If the beneficiary appeals the initial denial, the A/B MAC (A) obtains
> the ABN from the provider and determines whether it is valid. If the
> A/B MAC (A) determines that the
>
> ABN is invalid, it notifies the provider and the beneficiary that
> payment **may** be made to the extent that all other requirements are
> met.
>
> **D. Determining Whether Other Requirements for Payment are Met**
>
> Denials still are appropriate for any of the following reasons. The
> A/B MAC (A) must undertake the development needed to permit a
> determination as to whether:
>
> •The patient did not receive or require otherwise covered hospital
> services or a covered level of SNF care;
>
> •The benefits are exhausted;
>
> •The physician's certification requirement is not met;
>
> •There was no qualifying 3-day hospital stay (applicable to SNFs
> only); or
>
> •Transfer from the hospital to the SNF was not made on a timely basis.
> (However, if transfer to an institution which contains a participating
> SNF is made on a timely basis, a claim cannot be denied solely on the
> grounds that the transfer requirement is not met because the bed in
> which the beneficiary is placed is not a certified SNF bed.)
>
> The A/B MAC (A) denies cases falling within these categories under
> existing procedures. Also, if the beneficiary receives care in a
> totally nonparticipating institution, denial on the grounds that the
> beneficiary was not in a participating SNF or hospital is still
> appropriate.
>

> Noncertified SNF or Hospital Bed**\
> **(Rev .4001, Issued: 03-16-18, Effective: 06-19-18, Implementation:
> 06-19-18)**
>
> The A/B MAC (A) presumes that the provider properly notified the
> beneficiary of noncoverage, and that the beneficiary assented, if the
> claim includes the proper indicators of liability notification.
>
> The following development occurs only if the beneficiary appeals the
> A/B MAC (A)'s decision that the beneficiary may not have liability
> waived because the provider gave him/her timely notice that Medicare
> would not cover the accommodation; and that he/she consented to being
> placed in a noncertified bed.
>
> **A. Beneficiary Liability**
>
> If the A/B MAC (A) determines that the beneficiary did not consent to
> placement in a noncertified portion of the same institution that also
> includes the participating facility (see §130.3.C), and that no other
> basis for denial of the claim exists (see §130.3.D), it finds the
> beneficiary not liable under §1879 of the Act.
>
> **B. Provider Liability**
>
> If the beneficiary is found not liable under §1879, liability may rest
> with the provider, or with the program. Liability rests with the
> Medicare program, unless any of the following conditions exist, in
> which case the provider is liable for the services.
>
> The provider did not give timely written notice to the beneficiary of
> the implications of receiving care in a noncertified or
> inappropriately certified bed as discussed in §130.3.B;
>
> The provider failed to provide the beneficiary with an appropriate ABN
> and/or did not attempt to obtain a valid consent statement from the
> beneficiary. (See §130.3.C.); or
>
> The A/B MAC (A) determined from medical records in its claims files
> that it is clear that the beneficiary required and received services
> equivalent to a covered level of SNF care, or that constituted covered
> hospital services, and the provider had no reasonable basis for
> placing the beneficiary in a noncertified bed. Following are examples
> of situations in which it would be found that the provider did in fact
> have a reasonable basis to place a beneficiary in a noncertified bed:
>
> **EXAMPLES:**
>
> •The A/B MAC (A), a QIO, or Utilization Review Committee had advised
> the provider that the beneficiary did not require a covered level of
> SNF care or covered hospital services preadmission/admission;
>
> •The beneficiary's attending physician specifically advised the
> provider (verified by documentation in the medical record) that the
> beneficiary no longer required a covered level of care or services;
> note that if covered care had previously existed, effective July 1,
> 2005, notification under the expedited determination process would be
> required (see §20);
>
> •A beneficiary not requiring covered services had a change in his/her
> condition that later required a covered level of care or services and
> the provider had no certified bed available (of course, the SNF
> transfer requirement must be met, see the Medicare Benefit Policy
> Manual, Chapter 8.); or
>
> •The A/B MAC (A) has other sufficient evidence to determine that the
> provider acted in good faith but inadvertently placed the beneficiary
> in a noncertified bed.

> A medical necessity "partial denial" is the denial of coverage for the

>
> **Issue a determination.** QIOs make their determinations based on
> criteria in §1154(a) of the Act, which specifies that QIOs will
> determine whether:
>
> •the services are reasonable and medically necessary,
>
> •the services meet professionally recognized standards of care, and
>
> •the services could be safely be delivered in another setting.
>
> The QIO will make a determination and notify the beneficiary, the

>
> Providers must deliver the NOMNC to all beneficiaries eligible for the
> expedited determination process per §260.2. A NOMNC must be delivered
> even if the beneficiary agrees with the termination of services.
>
> Medicare providers are responsible for the delivery of the NOMNC.
> Providers may formally delegate the delivery of the notices to a

> requirements of valid notice delivery apply to designated agents.
>
> The provider must ensure that the beneficiary or representative signs
> and dates the NOMNC to demonstrate that the beneficiary or
> representative received the notice and understands that the
> termination decision can be disputed. Use of assistive devices may be
> used to obtain a signature.
>
> Electronic issuance of NOMNCs is not prohibited. If a provider elects
> to issue a NOMNC that is viewed on an electronic screen before
> signing, the beneficiary must be given the option of requesting paper
> issuance over electronic if that is what is preferred. Regardless of

> **(Rev. 2711, Issued: 05-24-13, Effective: 08-26-13, Implementation:

>
> The NOMNC should be delivered to the beneficiary at least two calendar
> days before Medicare covered services end or the second to last day of
> service if care is not being provided daily. For example, if the last
> day of covered SNF care is a Friday, the NOMNC should be delivered no
> later than the preceding Wednesday.
>
> Note: The two day advance requirement is NOT a 48 hour requirement.
> For example, if a patient's last covered home health service is at
> 10AM on Wednesday and the notice is delivered at 4PM on the prior
> Monday, it is considered timely.
>
> If home health services are being provided less frequently than daily,
> the notice must be delivered no later than the next to last visit
> before Medicare covered services end. For example, if home health care
> is provided on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and Tuesday is the last day of
> Medicare covered services, the notice must be delivered no later than
> the preceding Thursday.
>
> The NOMNC may be delivered earlier than two days preceding the end of
> covered services. However, delivery of the notice should be closely
> tied to the impending end of coverage so a beneficiary will more
> likely understand and retain the information regarding the right to an
> expedited determination.
>
> The notice may not be routinely given at the time services begin. An
> exception is when the services are expected to last fewer than two
> days. In these instances, the notice may be given by the provider when
> services begin.
>
> There is an accepted circumstance when the NOMNC may be delivered
> sooner than two days or the next to last visit before coverage ends.
> This exception is limited to cases where a beneficiary receiving home
> health services is found to no longer be homebound, and thus
> ineligible for covered home health care. In this circumstance, the
> NOMNC should be immediately delivered to the beneficiary upon
> discovery of the loss of homebound status. We expect that in the vast
> majority of cases, in all settings, the decision of a physician to end
> care will be based on medical necessity, and thus, foreseeable by the
> provider within the required time frames for notice delivery.

>
> If the beneficiary refuses to sign the NOMNC the provider should

The NOMNC may be delivered to a beneficiary's appointed or authorized
representative.

> Appointed representatives are individuals designated by beneficiaries
> to act on their behalf during the appeal process. A beneficiary may
> designate an appointed representative via the "Appointment of
> Representative" form, the CMS-1696.
>
> See Chapter 29 of the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, section
> 270.1, for more information on appointed representatives.
>
> CMS usually requires that notification to a beneficiary who has been
> deemed legally incompetent be made to an authorized representative of
> the beneficiary. Generally, an authorized representative is an
> individual who, under State or other applicable law, may make health
> care decisions on a beneficiary's behalf (e.g., the beneficiary's
> legal guardian, or someone appointed in accordance with a properly
> executed durable medical power of attorney).
>
> However, if a beneficiary is temporarily incapacitated a person
> (typically, a family member or close friend) whom the provider has
> determined could reasonable represent the beneficiary, but who has not
> been named in any legally binding document, may be a representative
> for the purpose of receiving the notices described in this section.
> Such a representative should have the beneficiary's best interests at
> heart and must act in a manner that is protective of the beneficiary
> and the beneficiary's rights. Therefore, a representative should have
> no relevant conflict of interest with the beneficiary.
>
> In these instances of delivering a notice to an unnamed
> representative, the provider should annotate the NOMNC with the name
> of the staff person initiating the contact, the name of the person
> contacted, and the date, time, and method (in person or telephone) of
> the contact. A copy of the NOMNC with this information should be
> retained in the beneficiary's record.
>
> Note - Exceptions to in person notice delivery. If the NOMNC must be
> delivered to a representative not living with the beneficiary, the
> provider is not required to make off-site in- person notice delivery
> to the representative. The provider must complete the\
> NOMNC as required and telephone the representative at least two days
> prior to the end of covered services. The provider should inform the
> representative of the beneficiary's right to appeal a coverage
> termination decision.
>
> The information provided should include the following:
>
> •The beneficiary's last day of covered services, and the date when the
> beneficiary's liability is expected to begin.
>
> •The beneficiary's right to appeal a coverage termination decision.
>
> •A description of how to request an appeal by a QIO.
>
> •The deadline to request a review as well as what to do if the
> deadline is missed.
>
> •The telephone number of the QIO to request the appeal.
>
> The date the provider communicates this information to the
> representative, whether by telephone or in writing, is considered the
> receipt date of the NOMNC.
>
> The NOMNC must be annotated with the following information on the day
> that the provider makes telephone contact:
>
> Reflect that all of the information indicated above was communicated
> to the representative;
>
> Note the name of the staff person initiating the contact, the name of
> the representative contacted by phone, the date and time of the
> telephone contact, and the telephone number called.
>
> A copy of the annotated NOMNC should be mailed to the representative
> the day telephone contact is made and a dated copy should be placed in
> the beneficiary's medical file.
>
> If the provider chooses to communicate the information in writing, a
> hard copy of the NOMNC must be sent to the representative by certified
> mail, return receipt requested, or any other delivery method that can
> provide signed verification of delivery (e.g. FedEx, UPS) The burden
> is on the provider to demonstrate that timely contact was attempted
> with the representative and that the notice was delivered.
>
> The date that someone at the representative's address signs (or
> refuses to sign) the receipt is considered the date received. Place a
> copy of the annotated NOMNC in the\
> beneficiary's medical file.
>
> If both the provider and the representative agree, providers may send
> the notice by fax or e-mail, however, providers fax and e-mail systems
> must meet the **The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
> Act of 1996 (**HIPAA) privacy and security\
> requirements.

> **(Rev. 2711, Issued: 05-24-13, Effective: 08-26-13, Implementation:

>
> The provider must retain the original signed NOMNC in the
> beneficiary's file. The beneficiary should receive a paper copy of the
> NOMNC that includes all of the required information such as the
> effective date and covered service at issue. Electronic notice
> retention is permitted if the NOMNC was delivered electronically.

>
> A beneficiary must obtain a physician certification stating that
> failure to continue home health or CORF services is likely to place
> the beneficiary's health at significant risk. Without such a
> certification statement a QIO may not make a determination for service
> terminations in these settings.
>
> The physician certification is a written statement from any licensed
> physician contacted by a beneficiary. This is a special certification
> required only in this expedited\
> determination process for expedited determinations in home health and
> CORF settings.
>
> A beneficiary may request an expedited determination from a QIO before

>
> When the QIO receives a request from a beneficiary, the QIO must

> **(Rev. 2711, Issued: 05-24-13, Effective: 08-26-13, Implementation:

The QIO must validate that the NOMNC included the required elements
outlined below:

> •Date that coverage of services ends.
>
> •Date that beneficiary's financial liability begins.
>
> •Description of right to an expedited determination (and how to
> request an expedited determination) and the right to submit relevant
> information to the QIO.
>
> •Right to detailed information on why the provider believes Medicare
> will no longer cover services.
>
> •Contact information for QIO in the state where services were
> delivered.
>
> The QIO should determine that NOMNC delivery was valid if all of the
> following criteria are met:
>
> •All elements stated above are included.
>
> •The beneficiary signed and dated the notice. If the NOMNC was
> annotated because the beneficiary refused to sign the notice upon
> delivery, the QIO may still conduct an expedited determination in
> these instances**.**
>
> •Notice was delivered at least two days before services terminate. For
> a non-residential provider, the notice may be delivered at the next to
> last visit before services terminate.
>
> Invalidating a NOMNC should be a rare occurrence. The only reasons to
> invalidate are the lack of one of the criteria stated above or a
> pattern of minor errors as established by the provider.
>
> If a QIO invalidates a NOMNC, a new NOMNC must be issued to the
> beneficiary with an effective date at least two days after the
> beneficiary receives valid notice. If the beneficiary again disagrees
> with the termination of care, a new request to the QIO must be made.

>
> No later than 72 hours after receipt of the request for an expedited

> coverage policies.
>
> **Note:** If the QIO does not receive supporting information from the

> or defer a decision until it receives the necessary information. If
> this delay results in continued services for the beneficiary, the
> provider may be held financially liable for these services as
> determined by the QIO.
>
> The QIO must notify the beneficiary, the beneficiary's physician, and
> the provider of services of its determination. This notification must
> include the rationale for the\
> determination and an explanation of Medicare payment consequences and
> beneficiary liability. QIOs must also inform the beneficiary of the
> right to an expedited\

>
> If the QIO decision extends coverage to a period where a physician's
> orders do not exist, either because of the duration of the expedited
> determination process, or because the physician has already concurred
> with the termination of care, providers cannot deliver care. In the
> event of a QIO decision favorable to a beneficiary without physician
> orders, the ordering physician should be made aware the QIO has ruled
> coverage should continue, and be given the opportunity to reinstate
> orders. The beneficiary may also seek other personal physicians to
> write orders for care as well as find another service provider. The
> expedited determination process does not override regulatory or State
> requirements that physician orders are required for a provider to
> deliver care.
>
> If a QIO decision is favorable to the beneficiary and the beneficiary
> resumes covered services, a new NOMNC should be delivered if that care
> is later terminated, per the requirements of this section. If the
> beneficiary again disagrees with the termination of care, a new
> request to the QIO must be made.
>
> The QIO decision will affect the necessity of subsequent Advance
> Beneficiary Notice of Noncoverage (ABN) deliveries.
>
> Example: If covered home health care continues following a favorable
> QIO decision for the beneficiary, the HHA would resume issuance of
> Home Health Advanced Beneficiary Notices (HHABNs) as warranted for the
> remainder of this home health episode. If the QIO decides that
> Medicare covered care should end and the patient wishes to continue
> receiving care from the HHA, even though Medicare will not pay, an
> HHABN with Option Box 1 must be issued to the beneficiary since this
> would be an initiation of non-covered care.
>
> Example: If covered Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) care continues
> following a favorable QIO decision for the beneficiary but later ends
> due to the end of Medicare coverage, and the patient wishes to
> continue receiving uncovered care at the SNF, a SNFABN must be issued
> to the beneficiary.

> denied, the beneficiary may appeal the denial within the standard
> claims appeal process (See Chapter 29 of this manual.)

> **(Rev. 2711, Issued: 05-24-13, Effective: 08-26-13, Implementation:

>
> Delivery of the NOMNC does not replace the required delivery of other
> mandatory notices, including ABNs. Notice delivery must be determined
> by the individual NOMNC requirements per this section and ABN delivery
> requirements per §1879 of the Act and per guidance in this chapter.
> Both the NOMNC and an ABN may be required in certain instances.
>
> Only one notice may be required when Medicare covered care is ending.
>
> Example: A beneficiary is receiving CORF services and all covered CORF
> care is ending. A NOMNC must be delivered at least two days, or two
> visits, prior to the end of coverage. If the beneficiary does not
> continue the CORF services, an ABN should not be issued.
>
> Some situations may require two notices at the end of Medicare covered
> care.
>
> Example: A beneficiary's Part A stay is ending because skilled level
> care is no longer medically necessary and the beneficiary wishes to
> remain in the SNF receiving custodial care. The beneficiary must
> receive the NOMNC two days prior to the end of coverage. A SNFABN must
> also be delivered before custodial care begins.
>
> It is also possible that no notice is required when Medicare coverage
> is ending.
>
> Example: A beneficiary exhausts the 100 day benefit in a SNF. In this
> instance, the NOMNC should not be delivered. The SNFABN is not
> required in this situation. However, it can be issued voluntarily, as
> a courtesy to the beneficiary.

> **(Rev. 1257, Issued: 05-25-07; Effective: 07-01-07; Implementation:

>
> A beneficiary who is dissatisfied with a QIO determination can request
> a reconsideration by an independent review entity (IRE). Such
> reconsiderations are codified in regulations effective July 1, 2005
> (42 CFR 405.1204) but are familiar to inpatient hospital providers as

>
> **Submitting a Request**: A beneficiary who chooses to exercise the
> right to an expedited reconsideration must submit a request to the
> appropriate IRE in writing or by telephone no later than noon of the
> calendar day following the initial notification (whether by telephone
> or in writing) of the QIO's determination. The beneficiary, upon
> request of the QIO, should be available to discuss the case or supply
> information that the IRE may request. The beneficiary may, but is not
> required to, submit written evidence to be considered by the IRE.
>
> **Untimely Requests:** When the beneficiary fails to make a timely
> request for an expedited reconsideration subsequently may request a
> reconsideration under the standard claims appeal process (See Chapter
> 29 of this Manual), but the coverage protection described in Section
> 300.5 would not extend through this reconsideration, nor would the
> notification timeframes or the escalation process described in Section
> 300.2 apply.

>
> **Receipt of the Request.** On the day the IRE receives the request
> for an expedited reconsideration, the IRE must immediately notify the
> QIO that made the expedited determination and the provider of services
> of the request for the expedited\
> reconsideration.
>
> **Examine Records and Other Information**. The IRE must offer the
> beneficiary and the provider an opportunity to provide further
> information.
>
> **Notification.** Unless the beneficiary requests an extension (see
> below), the IRE must notify the QIO, the beneficiary, and the provider
> of services of its decision no later than 72 hours after receipt of
> the request for an expedited reconsideration, and any such records
> needed for the reconsideration. The initial notification may be done
> by telephone followed by a written notice that includes:
>
> •The rationale for the reconsideration decision,\
> k\
> •An explanation of the Medicare payment consequences of the
> determination and the beneficiary's date of liability,
>
> •Information about the beneficiary's right to appeal the IRE's
> reconsideration decision to an ALJ, including how to request an appeal
> and the time period for doing so.
>
> **Escalation.** Unless the beneficiary requests an extension, if the
> IRE does not issue a decision within 72 hours of receipt of the
> request, the IRE must notify the beneficiary of his or her right to
> have the case escalated to the ALJ hearing level if the amount
> remaining in controversy is \$100 or more.
>
> **Extensions.** A beneficiary who requests an expedited
> reconsideration may request (either in writing or orally) that an IRE
> grant such additional time as the beneficiary specifies (not to exceed
> 14 days) for the reconsideration. If an extension is granted, the
> deadlines described above under notification, do not apply.
>
> **300.3 - The Responsibilities of the QIO**\
> **(Rev. 1257, Issued: 05-25-07; Effective: 07-01-07; Implementation:

>
> When an IRE notifies the QIO that a beneficiary has requested an
> expedited\
> reconsideration, the QIO must supply all information that the IRE
> needs to make its expedited reconsideration as soon as possible, but
> no later than by close of business of the day that the IRE notifies
> the QIO of the request for the reconsideration.
>
> At the beneficiary's request, the QIO must furnish the beneficiary
> with a copy of, or access to, any documentation that it sends to the
> IRE. The QIO may charge the beneficiary a reasonable amount to cover
> the costs of duplicating the documentation and/or delivering it to the
> beneficiary. The QIO must accommodate the request by no later than
> close of business of the first day after the material is requested.

>
> The provider may, but is not required to, submit evidence to be
> considered by an IRE in making its decision. If a provider fails to
> comply with an IRE's request for additional information beyond that
> furnished by the QIO for purposes of the expedited\
> determination, the IRE makes its reconsideration decision based on the

>
> The MOON must be delivered to beneficiaries in Original Medicare
> (fee-for-service) and Medicare Advantage enrollees who receive
> observation services as outpatients for more than 24 hours. The
> hospital or CAH must provide the MOON no later than 36 hours after

>
> •Beneficiaries who do not have Part B coverage (as noted on the MOON,
> observation stays are covered under Medicare Part B).
>
> •Beneficiaries who are subsequently admitted as an inpatient prior to

>
> •Beneficiaries for whom Medicare is either the primary or secondary

> The statute expressly provides that the MOON be delivered to
> beneficiaries who receive observation services as an outpatient for
> more than 24 hours. In other words, the statute does not require

> receive observation services for more than 24 hours that they are
> outpatients receiving observation services and not inpatients, and the
> reasons for such status, and must be delivered no later than 36 hours
> after observation services begin. However, hospitals and CAHs may
> deliver the MOON to an individual receiving observation services as an
> outpatient before such individual has received more than 24 hours of

> individual has received 24 hours of observation services affords
>
> hospitals and CAHs the flexibility to deliver the MOON consistent with
> any applicable State law that requires notice to outpatients receiving
> observation services within 24 hours after observation services begin.
> The flexibility to deliver the MOON any time up to, but no later than,
> 36 hours after observation services begin also allows hospitals and
