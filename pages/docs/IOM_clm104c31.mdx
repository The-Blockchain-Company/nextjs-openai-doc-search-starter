# - Background

## (Rev. 2937, Issued; 04-25-14, Effective: 04-14-14, Implementation: 04-14-14)

> This section provides information on Medicare's implementation of the
> Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12 Health Care Eligibility
> Benefit Inquiry and Response (270/271) transaction (short reference:
> ASC X12 270/271 eligibility transaction). The CMS supports the
> currently mandated version of the transaction based upon the currently
> mandated version of the ASC X12 Standards for Electronic Data
> Interchange Technical Report Type 3\--Health Care Eligibility Benefit
> Inquiry and Response (270/271), both of which were adopted as the
> National standard for the health care eligibility benefit inquiry and
> response under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
> of 1996 (HIPAA). The technical report 3 is also known as a TR3 or
> implementation guide (IG). (Refer to chapter 24 for current versions
> adopted under HIPAA.)

# - ASC X12 276/277 Claims Status Request/Response Transaction Standard

### *(Rev. 10236, Issued: 07-31-2020, Effective: 08-31-2020, Implementation: 08-31-2020)*

> These instructions apply to Medicare Administrative Contractors
> (MACs), Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors
> (DME MACs), the Common Electronic Data Interchange (CEDI) contractor
> for DME MACs, and their shared systems on Medicare requirements for
> their implementation of the current HIPAA compliant version of the ASC

# - Transmission Requirements

## (Rev. 2937, Issued; 04-25-14, Effective: 04-14-14, Implementation: 04-14-14)

> A/B MACs, DME MACs, and CEDI may continue to operate automated
> response unit (ARU) capability for providers to request and receive
> claim status information. ARUs are not considered EDI and are not
> affected by the HIPAA requirements. Nor do they impact response time
> requirements for the standard transactions implemented under HIPAA.

# - Batch Transactions

## (Rev. 2937, Issued; 04-25-14, Effective: 04-14-14, Implementation: 04-14-14)

> Contractors must be able to accept the current ASC X12 276 claim
> status request in batch mode, and respond via the ASC X12 277 claim
> status response in batch mode. If a contractor currently supports
> batch capability in any EDI batch format to request claim status, the
> response time for issuance of an ASC X12 277 claim status response
> transaction in response must be within one business day of the receipt
> of a valid ASC X12 276 claim status request transaction.

# - Online Direct Data Entry (DDE)

## (Rev. 4260; Issued: 03-22-19; Effective: 04-22-19; Implementation: 04-22-19)

> The term Medicare beneficiary identifier (Mbi) is a general term
> describing a beneficiary\'s Medicare identification number. For
> purposes of this manual, Medicare beneficiary identifier references
> both the Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) and the Medicare
> Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) during the new Medicare card transition
>
> period and after for certain business areas that will continue to use
> the HICN as part of their processes.
>
> The HIPAA uses the term "direct data entry" generically to refer to a
> type of functionality operated by many different payers under a
> variety of titles. Within this instruction, the acronym DDE is being
> used to refer to any type of direct data entry system maintained by
> contractors, or shared system maintainers, including A/B MAC (A) or
> (HHH) DDE or equivalent functionality that may have a different title.
> Although DDE operates online, DDE does not typically operate on a
> detailed inquiry and response basis. For claim status purposes, data
> is maintained within an interactive database that providers may access
> to view screens containing a wide variety of information on their
> claims. A provider accesses that data by furnishing certain
> identifying data for security purposes to establish their right to
> read the data and to specify those claim records the provider wishes
> to review.
>
> The information in this database for specific claims or providers is
> initiated when a provider enters claim data, and is then updated by a
> contractor to include subsequent actions taken that affect that claim.
> DDE was specifically permitted to continue in the HIPAA initial
> transactions final rule (45 CFR 162.923), with the stipulation that
> direct data entry is subject to "...the applicable data content and
> data condition requirements of the standard when conducting the
> transaction. The health care provider is not required to use the
> format requirements of the standard.\"
>
> Data content conformity means that the same information permitted or
> required by the ASC X12 277 claim status response implementation guide
> must be reported in the claims status screens (the DDE outbound). The
> DDE outbound may not report a data element for claim status purposes
> that is not included in the ASC X12 277 claim status response, exceeds
> the maximum length of the data element in the ASC X12 277 claim status
> response, does not meet the minimum length for the data element in the
> ASC X12 277 claim status response, or that does not meet the ASC X12
> 277 claim status response requirement that the data element be
> numeric, alpha-numeric, an amount, or meet another characteristic as
> specified in the ASC X12 277 claim status response. On the inbound,
> the DDE system can require less information than the ASC X12 276 claim
> status request, but not more. The inquirer is not required to furnish
> information in the DDE inquiry that is available by other means to the
> contractor. Any data element keyed in a DDE system must conform to the
> requirements. The ASC X12 standard TR3 include data element length and
> characteristics in their definition of data attributes.
>
> Conformity does not mean that a DDE screen that includes claim status
> information must display each of the data qualifiers or other means of
> data identification contained in the ASC X12 277 claim status response
> implementation guide. DDE screens typically identify, explicitly or by
> context, the type of information being reported in a field, e.g.,
> would identify if a number represents a HCPCS, Medicare beneficiary
> identifier, amount, grams, date of birth, etc. DDE screens would not
> be expected to use a qualifier contained in the ASC X12 277 claim
> status response to identify data type if that is otherwise evident in
> the design or content of the DDE screen.
>
> Shared system maintainers must map the DDE claim status data elements
> to the ASC X12 276/277 claim status request and response
> implementation guide to determine if the DDE claim status data
> elements meet the conformity requirements above. If needed, changes
> must be made to enable contractor DDE claim status data elements to
> conform.
>
> If a contractor continues to support DDE, it must be offered in
> addition to batch ASC X12 276/277 claim status request and response,
> but the contractor must take one of two approaches to assure their
> claim status data content conforms to the requirements:

1.  Eliminate claim status data elements from the DDE screens, unless
    > those data elements are also needed for a purpose other than claim
    > status. For example, if a data element is needed in a DDE screen
    > for claim entry or claim correction, and it is also used to help
    > determine claim status, retain the data element so it can continue
    > to be used for claim entry or correction. If a data element is
    > used solely for claim status, and is not essential for an
    > alternate purpose, eliminate it; or

2.  If a contractor elects to continue to display claim status-specific
    > data elements in their DDE screens, those data elements must at a
    > minimum contain/report data that conforms to:

    -   All required and applicable conditional data elements for those
        > segments in the ASC X12 277 claim status response; and

    -   Data content as specified for those data elements in the ASC X12
        > 277 claim status response, as applicable, including compliance
        > with the data attributes for those data elements as defined in
        > the ASC X12 277 implementation guide.

> Preliminary feedback from contractors suggests that existing DDE
> screens used for Medicare may already conform to the ASC X12 277 claim
> status response implementation guide requirements, but data element
> mapping is required to verify. For example, since industry input was
> used to develop the ASC X12 277 claim status response implementation
> guide as well as, presumably the data elements for claim status
> currently furnished via DDE, it is unlikely that DDE screen field
> sizes would be larger than the ASC X12 277 claim status response
> maximum length or shorter than the ASC X12 277 claim status response
> minimum length. It is also unlikely that a DDE screen would contain a
> data element considered important for claim status that is not
> included in the ASC X12 277 claim status response, or vice versa.
>
> If a shared system maintainer determines that DDE screen changes are
> required, the maintainer in conjunction with its users must determine
> if it would be cost effective to modify the DDE screens to conform to
> the ASC X12 277 claim status response implementation guide. If not
> cost effective, the maintainer must eliminate the claim status-only
> data elements from the DDE screens and require the contractors to use
> the batch ASC X12 276/277 claim status request and response, an ARU,
> and/or other non- EDI means to obtain claim status information.
>
> If retention is cost effective, the maintainer must modify these
> screens as necessary to ensure that providers are able to access all
> applicable data content available in the ASC X12 277 claim status
> response. The DDE screens must be able to furnish providers
> information that conforms to the data that would have been issued to
> the provider in an ASC X12 277 claim status response. See above for
> the discussion of conformity.

## (Rev. 2937, Issued; 04-25-14, Effective: 04-14-14, Implementation: 04-14-14)

A.  The contractor's translator must perform editing on the submitted
    > ASC X12 276 claim status request transaction at the ASC X12
    > standard and implementation levels, and generate an ASC X12 TA1
    > interchange acknowledgment in batch if an interchange control

> receipt of the ASC X12 276 claim status request.
>
> An ASC X12 TA1 interchange acknowledgment and ASC X12 999
> implementation acknowledgment of an ASC X12 276 claim status request
> submitted in an interactive/online mode must be issued as quickly as
> the ASC X12 277 claim status response would have been issued had the
> ASC X12 276 claim status request been valid.
>
> Under the current HIPAA adopted ASC X12 version, inclusive of any
> adopted Errata moving forward, the contractor's translator shall edit
> the incoming ASC X12 276 claim status request transaction as
> documented by the CMS 276/277 Edits spreadsheet (as updated per
> quarterly release) from the CMS Website:
> [[http://www.cms.gov/ElectronicBillingEDITrans/10_ClaimStatus.asp#TopOfPage]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/ElectronicBillingEDITrans/10_ClaimStatus.asp#TopOfPage)

B.  The shared system shall continue to process claim status
    > transactions in current ASC X12 version to include edits to verify
    > that the submitted ASC X12 276 data complies with IG and Medicare
    > requirements. If edits are failed, the shared system must generate
    > an edit report following the model established for TR3 and
    > Medicare program edit reporting for the HIPAA compliant version of
    > the ASC X12 837 claim implementation. The edit report must include
    > any reason(s) for the rejection in a concise but explicit manner
    > that can be understood by provider staff as well as contractor
    > staff. Contractors will forward the edit messages to submitters
    > for correction of the edit condition. The shared system must
    > generate these edit reports within 1 business day.

> The TR3 edits must be performed as defined in the TR3 segment and data
> element notes, data element attributes, conditions of use, and overall
> guiding principles for use of the standards as contained in the
> introduction section and addenda to the IG. The Medicare program edits
> must be performed as required by current Medicare program
> instructions.

C.  The A/B MAC or, for DME, the CEDI contractor, shall process inbound
    > claim status transactions in the current ASC X12 version(s)
    > (inclusive of any ASC X12 Errata) and beyond to include the edits
    > defined in the CMS 276/277 Edits spreadsheet as translator
    > applicable in order to pass to the Part A or Part B Common Edits
    > and Enhancement Module (CEM) software a CMS defined flat file
    > format (inclusive of Control Record(s) hereafter referred to as
    > CTRD).

> For Part A and Part B, the CEM software shall perform all edits not
> marked as Translator on the CMS 276/277 Edits spreadsheet for inbound
> claim status transactions in order to pass the fully edited inbound
> claim status transaction on to the appropriate Part A or Part B shared
> system for appropriate claim status request processing in the shared
> system.
>
> For DME, the CEDI contractor shall also process inbound claim status
> transactions in the current ASC X12 version(s) (inclusive of any ASC
> X12 Errata) and beyond to also include edits defined in the CMS
> 276/277 Edits spreadsheet other than translator applicable in order to
> pass the fully edited inbound claim status transaction on to the DME
> shared system for appropriate claim status request processing in the
> shared system.

D.  For claim status request and response transactions formatted in the
    > current ASC X12 version(s) and beyond the shared system:

    -   Updates the Control Record database with the CTRD record for the
        > activities being processed (e.g. interchange -- ISA segment to
        > IEA) and appropriate content of the Control Record. Stores any
        > ASC X12 276 claim status request data elements required for
        > preparation of a compliant ASC X12 277 claim status response
        > that are either not retained in the Medicare core system, or
        > exceed the size limits for that type of data in the Medicare
        > core system in a temporary file.

> Completes the application request/inquiry according to the components
> that outbound claim status response requires, as well as, generates
> and populates the outbound Control Record for the outbound claim
> status response. These processes shall comply with the TR3 for the ASC
> X12 transaction and the CMS defined Control Record definition
> (inclusive of any quarterly release updates). The shared system shall
> also perform data scrubbing of outbound data prior to the data exiting
> the Enterprise Data Center (EDC) and being transferred to the Local
> Data Center (LDC) as deemed appropriate by CMS and the MACs. The
> initial instructions for the outbound data scrubbing were contained in
> Transmittal 702, Change Request 6946. This edit process shall be
> implemented beginning with the October 2010 release for DME and in the
> January 2011 release for Part A and Part B shared systems. The
> processes shall be modified through subsequent releases, as directed
> via future Change Requests, add to the editing process of the
