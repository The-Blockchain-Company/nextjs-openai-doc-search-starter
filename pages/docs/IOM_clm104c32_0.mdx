10. # **- Diagnostic Blood Pressure Monitoring**
**(Rev. 109, 02-27-04)**

1. # <a name="_bookmark2"></a>**- Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) Billing Requirements**
## **(Rev. 11021; Issued: 10-01-21; Effective: 10-29-21; Implementation: 10-29-21)**

1. **Coding Applicable to A/B MACs (A and B)**

Effective April 1, 2002, a National Coverage Decision was made to allow for Medicare coverage of ABPM for those beneficiaries with suspected "white coat hypertension" (WCH). ABPM involves the use of a non-invasive device, which is used to measure blood pressure in 24-hour cycles. These 24-hour measurements are stored in the device and are later interpreted by a physician. Suspected "WCH" is defined as: (1) Clinic/office blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg on at least three separate clinic/office visits with two separate measurements made at each visit; (2) At least two documented separate blood pressure measurements taken outside the clinic/office which are < 140/90 mm Hg; and (3) No evidence of end-organ damage. ABPM is not covered for any other uses. Coverage policy can be found in Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual, Chapter 1, Part 1,

§20.19. (<http://www.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/103_cov_determ/ncd103index.asp>).

The ABPM must be performed for at least 24 hours to meet coverage criteria. Payment is not allowed for institutionalized beneficiaries, such as those receiving Medicare covered skilled nursing in a facility. In the rare circumstance that ABPM needs to be performed more than once for a beneficiary, the qualifying criteria described above must be met for each subsequent ABPM test.

Effective dates for applicable Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes for ABPM for suspected WCH and their covered effective dates are as follows:


|**HCPCS**|**Definition**|**Effective Date**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|93784|ABPM, utilizing a system such as magnetic tape and/or computer disk, for 24 hours or longer; including recording, scanning analysis, interpretation and report.|04/01/2002|
|93786|ABPM, utilizing a system such as magnetic tape and/or computer disk, for 24 hours or longer; recording only.|04/01/2002|
|93788|ABPM, utilizing a system such as magnetic tape and/or computer disk, for 24 hours or longer; scanning analysis with report.|01/01/2004|

CMS established a related policy entitled Counseling to Prevent Tobaccos Use at NCD Manual 210.4.1 effective August 25, 2010. However, effective September 30, 2016, the conditions of Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B coverage for smoking and tobacco-use cessation counseling services (210.4) were deleted.

The remaining NCD entitled Counseling to Prevent Tobacco Use (210.4.1), remains in effect, along with HCPCS codes 99406 and 99407, specifically payable for counseling to prevent tobacco use effective October 1, 2016.

Sacral nerve stimulation involves both a temporary test stimulation to determine if an implantable stimulator would be effective and a permanent implantation in appropriate candidates. Both the test and the permanent implantation are covered.

The following limitations for coverage apply to all indications:

- Patient must be refractory to conventional therapy (documented behavioral, pharmacologic and/or surgical corrective therapy) and be an appropriate surgical candidate such that implantation with anesthesia can occur.

- Patients with stress incontinence, urinary obstruction, and specific neurologic diseases (e.g., diabetes with peripheral nerve involvement) that are associated with secondary manifestations of the above three indications are excluded.

- Patient must have had a successful test stimulation in order to support subsequent implantation. Before a patient is eligible for permanent implantation, he/she must demonstrate a 50% or greater improvement through test stimulation. Improvement is measured through voiding diaries.

- Patient must be able to demonstrate adequate ability to record voiding diary data such that clinical results of the implant procedure can be properly evaluated.

50. # <a name="_bookmark37"></a>**– Deep Brain Stimulation for Essential Tremor and Parkinson’s Disease**
## **(Rev. 128, 03-26-04)**

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) refers to high-frequency electrical stimulation of anatomic regions deep within the brain utilizing neurosurgically implanted electrodes. These DBS electrodes are stereotactically placed within targeted nuclei on one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) sides of the brain. There are currently three targets for DBS -- the thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus (VIM), subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus interna (GPi).

Essential tremor (ET) is a progressive, disabling tremor most often affecting the hands. ET may also affect the head, voice and legs. The precise pathogenesis of ET is unknown. While it may start at any age, ET usually peaks within the second and sixth decades. Beta- adrenergic blockers and anticonvulsant medications are usually the first line treatments for reducing the severity of tremor. Many patients, however, do not adequately respond or cannot tolerate these medications. In these medically refractory ET patients, thalamic VIM DBS may be helpful for symptomatic relief of tremor.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative disorder involving the loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. The disease is characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and progressive postural instability.

Dopaminergic medication is typically used as a first line treatment for reducing the primary

symptoms of PD. However, after prolonged use, medication can become less effective and can produce significant adverse events such as dyskinesias and other motor function complications. For patients who become unresponsive to medical treatments and/or have intolerable side effects from medications, DBS for symptom relief may be considered.

1. # <a name="_bookmark38"></a>**– Coverage Requirements**
## **(Rev. 128, 03-26-04)**

Effective on or after April 1, 2003, Medicare will cover unilateral or bilateral thalamic VIM DBS for the treatment of ET and/or Parkinsonian tremor and unilateral or bilateral STN or GPi DBS for the treatment of PD only under the following conditions:

1. Medicare will only consider DBS devices to be reasonable and necessary if they are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved devices for DBS or devices used in accordance with FDA approved protocols governing Category B Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) DBS clinical trials.

1. For thalamic VIM DBS to be considered reasonable and necessary, patients must meet all of the following criteria:

1. Diagnosis of essential tremor (ET) based on postural or kinetic tremors of hand(s) without other neurologic signs, or diagnosis of idiopathic PD (presence of at least 2 cardinal PD features (tremor, rigidity or bradykinesia)) which is of a tremor- dominant form.

1. Marked disabling tremor of at least level 3 or 4 on the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Clinical Tremor Rating Scale (or equivalent scale) in the extremity intended for treatment, causing significant limitation in daily activities despite optimal medical therapy.

1. Willingness and ability to cooperate during conscious operative procedure, as well as during post-surgical evaluations, adjustments of medications and stimulator settings.

1. For STN or GPi DBS to be considered reasonable and necessary, patients must meet all of the following criteria:

1. Diagnosis of PD based on the presence of at least 2 cardinal PD features (tremor, rigidity or bradykinesia).

1. Advanced idiopathic PD as determined by the use of Hoehn and Yahr stage or Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III motor subscale.

1. L-dopa responsive with clearly defined “on” periods.

1. Persistent disabling Parkinson’s symptoms or drug side effects (e.g., dyskinesias, motor fluctuations, or disabling “off” periods) despite optimal medical therapy.

1. Willingness and ability to cooperate during conscious operative procedure, as well as during post-surgical evaluations, adjustments of medications and stimulator settings.

The DBS is not reasonable and necessary and is not covered for ET or PD patients with any of the following:

1. Non-idiopathic Parkinson’s disease or “Parkinson’s Plus” syndromes.

1. Cognitive impairment, dementia or depression which would be worsened by or would interfere with the patient’s ability to benefit from DBS.

1. Current psychosis, alcohol abuse or other drug abuse.

1. Structural lesions such as basal ganglionic stroke, tumor or vascular malformation as etiology of the movement disorder.

1. Previous movement disorder surgery within the affected basal ganglion.

1. Significant medical, surgical, neurologic or orthopedic co-morbidities contraindicating DBS surgery or stimulation.

Patients who undergo DBS implantation should not be exposed to diathermy (deep heat treatment including shortwave diathermy, microwave diathermy and ultrasound diathermy) or any type of MRI which may adversely affect the DBS system or adversely affect the brain around the implanted electrodes.

The DBS should be performed with extreme caution in patients with cardiac pacemakers or other electronically controlled implants which may adversely affect or be affected by the DBS system.

For DBS lead implantation to be considered reasonable and necessary, providers and facilities must meet all of the following criteria:

1. Neurosurgeons must: (a) be properly trained in the procedure; (b) have experience with the surgical management of movement disorders, including DBS therapy; and (c) have experience performing stereotactic neurosurgical procedures

1. Operative teams must have training and experience with DBS systems, including knowledge of anatomical and neurophysiological characteristics for localizing the targeted nucleus, surgical and/or implantation techniques for the DBS system, and operational and functional characteristics of the device.

1. Physicians specializing in movement disorders must be involved in both patient selection and post-procedure care.

1. Hospital medical centers must have: (a) brain imaging equipment (MRI and/or CT) for pre-operative stereotactic localization and targeting of the surgical site(s); (b) operating rooms with all necessary equipment for stereotactic surgery; and (c) support services necessary for care of patients undergoing this procedure and any potential complications arising intraoperatively or postoperatively.

The prothrombin time (PT) test is an in-vitro test to assess coagulation. PT testing and its normalized correlate, the International Normalized Ratio (INR), are the standard measurements for therapeutic effectiveness of warfarin therapy. Warfarin, Coumadin®, and others, are self-administered, oral anticoagulant, or blood thinner, medications that affect a person’s Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.

Use of the INR allows physicians to determine the level of anticoagulation in a patient independent of the laboratory reagents used. The INR is the ratio of the patient's prothrombin time compared to the mean prothrombin time for a group of normal individuals.

1. # <a name="_bookmark55"></a>**– Coverage Requirements**

## **(Rev. 1562, Issued: 07-25-08, Effective: 03-19-08, Implementation: 08-25-08)**

For services furnished on or after July 1, 2002, Medicare will cover the use of home INR monitoring for anticoagulation management for patients with mechanical heart valves on warfarin. The monitor and the home testing must be prescribed by a physician and the following patient requirements must be met:

66. # <a name="_bookmark76"></a>**– No Cost Items**
## **(Rev. 1147, Issued: 01-05-07, Effective: 11-06-06, Implementation: 02-05-07)**

On occasion, providers may receive an item (such as a device or drug) that is offered by a manufacturer/supplier free of charge. Such items, for purposes of these instructions, are considered “no cost items.” Providers are not to seek reimbursement for no cost items as noted in Section 1862(a)(2) of the Social Security Act.

1. # <a name="_bookmark77"></a>**– Practitioner Billing for No Cost Items**
## **(Rev. 1657, Issued: 12-31-08, Effective: 01-01-09, Implementation: 01-05-09)**

Practitioners typically should not bill for no cost items as there is no non-covered charges field on the claim and there are also no system edits in place to require providers to do so. However, practitioners are required to report Category A IDE devices received at no cost on claims as specified in §68.3 of this chapter (although they will not receive payment).

1. # <a name="_bookmark78"></a>**– Institutional Billing for No Cost Items**
**(Rev. 4013, Issued: 03-30-18, Effective: 01-01-09, Implementation: 06-29-18)**

Generally speaking, institutional, providers should not have to report the usage of a no cost item. However, for some claims (e.g., hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) claims), providers may be required to bill a no cost item due to claims processing edits that require an item (even if received at no cost) to be billed along with an associated service (e.g., a specified device must be reported along with a specified implantation procedure).

For OPPS claims, when a drug is provided at no cost, claims processing edits prevent drug administration charges from being billed when the claim does not contain a covered/billable drug charge. Therefore, for drugs provided at no cost in the hospital outpatient department, providers must report the applicable drug HCPCS code and appropriate units with a token charge of less than $1.01 for the item in the covered charge field and mirror this less than $1.01 amount reported in the noncovered charge field. Providers must also bill the corresponding drug administration charge with the appropriate drug administration CPT or HCPCS code.

For OPPS claims, providers must report a token charge of less than $1.01 for the item in the covered charge field, along with the applicable HCPCS modifier (i.e., modifier –FB) appended to the procedure code that reports the service requiring a device. For more information on billing no cost items under the OPPS, refer to Chapter 4, §20.6.9 and 61.3.1 of this manual.

By billing in this way, the provider is accomplishing four things:

1) Communicating to the contractor that the provider is not seeking payment for the no cost item;

1) Reflecting, with completeness and accuracy, all services provided to the patient;

1) Preventing the line item or claim from being rejected/denied by system edits that require an item to be billed in conjunction with an associated procedure (such as implantation or administration procedures);

1) Assuring that the patient and provider are not held liable for any charges for the no cost item.

Future updates will be issued in a Recurring Update Notification.

1. # <a name="_bookmark79"></a>**– Billing No Cost Items Due to Recall, Replacement, or Free Sample**
## **(Rev. 3181, Issued: 01-30-15, Effective: 07-01-15, Implementation: 07-06-15)**

Currently, institutional providers that use the Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System (HCPCS) bill device HCPCS codes for no cost or full credit items with token charges in order for claims to pass OPPS claims processing edits that require certain devices to be billed with their associated procedures so that payment can be made.

Effective January 1, 2006, modifier –FB is used to indicate that an item used in a procedure was furnished without cost to the provider, and, therefore, it is not being charged to Medicare or the beneficiary. More information on billing HCPCS modifier –FB can be located in Chapter 4, §20.6.9 and 61.3.1 of this manual.

Effective April 1, 2006, two new condition codes were created for institutional use: 49 and 50 (Table 1). These new codes are used to identify and track medical devices that are provided by a manufacturer at no cost or with full credit to the hospital due to warranty for a malfunction or recall.


|**Table 1: New Condition Codes and Descriptions**|
| :- |
|**Condition Code**|**Description**|
|49|Product Replacement within Product Lifecycle|Replacement of a product earlier than the anticipated lifecycle.|
|50|Product Replacement for Known Recall of a Product|Manufacturer or FDA has identified the product for recall and therefore replacement.|

0. Providers must use these condition codes to identify medical devices that are provided by a manufacturer at no cost or with full credit due to warranty or recall. These condition codes will be used to track no cost/full credit devices replaced due to recall or warranty.

0. Providers must report these condition codes on any inpatient or outpatient institutional claim that includes a no cost/full credit replacement device when conditions of warranty or recall are met.

**NOTE:** OPPS hospitals billing no cost/full credit devices must append modifier –FB to the procedure code for implanting the no cost/full credit device, along with the appropriate condition code if applicable (in Table 1 above), in instances when claims processing edits require that certain devices be billed with their associated procedures. The modifier identifies the procedure code line for the no cost/full credit device, while the condition code explains if the device was provided free of cost due to warranty or recall.

Effective January 1, 2014, an additional new condition code was created for institutional use: 53 (Table 2). This new code is used to identify and track medical devices that are provided

by a manufacturer at no cost or with full credit to the hospital due a clinical trial or a free sample.


|**Table 2: New Condition Codes and Descriptions**|
| :- |
|**Condition Code**|**Description**|
|49|Product Replacement within Product Lifecycle|Replacement of a product earlier than the anticipated lifecycle.|
|50|Product Replacement for Known Recall of a Product|Manufacturer or FDA has identified the product for recall and therefore replacement.|
|53|Initial placement of a medical device provided as part of a clinical trial or free sample|Code is for outpatient claims that have received a device credit upon initial medical device placement in a clinical trial or a free sample.|

0. Providers must use these condition codes to identify medical devices that are provided by a manufacturer at no cost or with full credit due to warranty, recall, or free sample. These condition codes will be used to track no cost/full credit devices replaced due to recall, warranty, or free sample.

0. Providers must report these condition codes on any inpatient or outpatient institutional claim that includes a no cost/full credit replacement device when conditions of warranty, recall, or free sample are met.

**NOTE:** OPPS hospitals billing no cost/full credit devices are no longer required to append modifier –FB to the procedure code for implanting the no cost/full credit device, along with the appropriate condition code if applicable (in Table 2 above), in instances when claims processing edits require that certain devices be billed with their associated procedures.

Effective January 1, 2014, if the Category B IDE device is provided at no cost, outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) providers must report a token charge in the covered charge field along with condition code “53” and Value Code “FD”. For more information on billing ‘no cost items’ under the OPPS, refer to Chapter 4, §§20.6.9 and 61.3.1 of this manual.

## **Practitioner Billing**

Routine Costs

Practitioners shall submit claims for the routine costs of a clinical trial involving a Category B IDE device by billing according to the clinical trial billing instructions found in section 69.6 of this chapter.

Category B Device

Effective for claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2014, it is **mandatory** to report a clinical trial number on claims for items/services provided in clinical trials/studies/registries, or under CED. Providers report the 8-digit number on the following claims locators:

- 837 professional claim format (do not use ‘CT’ on the electronic claim) or,

- CMS-1500 paper form-place in Field 19 (preceded by ‘CT’).

In addition to the clinical trial number, claims shall include (in either the primary/secondary positions):

- If ICD-9-CM is applicable, ICD-9 diagnosis code V70.7

- If ICD-10-CM is applicable, ICD-10 diagnosis code Z00.6

- HCPCS modifier Q0 or Q1 as appropriate

Claims submitted without a clinical trial number shall be returned as unprocessable reporting the following messages:

CARC 16: “Claim/service lacks information which is needed for adjudication. At least one Remark Code must be provided (may be comprised of either NCPDP Reject Reason Code, or Remittance Advice Remark Code that is not an ALERT.)”

RARC MA50: “Missing/incomplete/invalid Investigational Device Exemption number for FDA-approved clinical trial services.”

RARC MA130: “Your claim contains incomplete and/or invalid information, and no appeal rights are afforded because the claim is unprocessable. Please submit a new claim with the

complete/correct information.”

Group Code-Contractual Obligation (CO)

Effective for dates of service on or before December 31, 2007, practitioners must bill the Category B IDE device on a line with a QA modifier (FDA IDE) along with the IDE number. However, effective for dates of service on or after January 1, 2008, practitioners will no longer bill a QA modifier to identify a Category B device. Instead, practitioners will bill a Q0 modifier (numeral 0 versus the letter O) (Investigational clinical service provided in a clinical research study that is in an approved clinical research study) along with the IDE number.

The following table shows the designated field locations to report the Category B IDE number on institutional and practitioner claims:


|**Data**|**CMS-1450**|**CMS-1500**|**837 institutional claim format and 837 professional claim format**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|IDE #|Revenue Code Description field|Item 23|Segment 2300, REF02(REF01=LX)|

Contractors will validate the IDE number for the Category B device when modifier Q0 is submitted on the claim along with the IDE number. Claims containing an invalid IDE number will be returned to the provider using the following messages:

RARC MA50: “Missing/incomplete/invalid Investigational Device Exemption Number for FDA approved clinical trial services.”

CARC 16: “Claim/service lacks information which is needed for adjudication. At least one Remark Code must be provided (may be comprised of either NCPDP Reject Reason Code, or Remittance Advice Remark Code that is not an ALERT.”

## **(Rev. 1147, Issued: 01-05-07, Effective: 11-06-06, Implementation: 02-05-07)**

The CMS has issued a National Coverage Determination (NCD) which allows Medicare coverage for the routine costs of qualifying clinical trial services as well as reasonable and necessary items and services used to diagnose and treat complications arising from participation in all clinical trials. The coverage requirements for routine costs of qualifying clinical trial services are contained in [The National Coverage Determinations Manual, Section](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/downloads/ncd103c1_Part4.pdf) [310.1.](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/downloads/ncd103c1_Part4.pdf)

1. # <a name="_bookmark84"></a>**- Payment for Qualifying Clinical Trial Services**
## **(Rev. 2998, Issued: 07-25-14, Effective: Upon implementation of ICD-10; 01-01-12 - ASC X12, Implementation: 08-25-2014 - ASC X12; Upon Implementation of ICD-10)**
For dates of service on or after September 19, 2000, pay for covered services furnished to beneficiaries participating in qualifying clinical trials. Payment is based on the payment methodology applicable for the service that was furnished (e.g., physician fee schedule, lab fee schedule, durable medical equipment fee schedule, reasonable charge, etc.). With the exception of managed care enrollees, applicable deductibles and coinsurance rules apply to clinical trial items and services. The Part A and Part B deductibles are assumed to be met for covered clinical trial services billed on a fee service basis for managed care enrollees.

**NOTE:** Effective for claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2014, it is **mandatory** to report a clinical trial number on claims for items/services provided in clinical trials/studies/registries, or under CED. This is the number assigned by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) ClinicalTrials.gov Web site when a new study appears in the NLM Clinical Trials data base. This number is listed prominently on each specific study’s page and is always preceded by the letters “NCT.” Contractors verify the validity of a trial/study/registry by consulting CMS’s clinical trials/registry web site at: [http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/MedicareApprovedFacilitie/index.html) [Information/MedicareApprovedFacilitie/index.html.](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/MedicareApprovedFacilitie/index.html)

**NOTE:** Contractors shall ensure value code ‘D4’/amount data from their internal claims processing is mapped/populated to the 837 institutional claim format for a coordination of benefits 837 institutional claim.

1. # <a name="_bookmark85"></a>**- Medical Records Documentation Requirements**
## **(Rev. 487, Issued: 03-04-05, Effective and Implementation: N/A)**

The billing provider must include in the beneficiary's medical record the following information: trial name, sponsor, and sponsor-assigned protocol number. This information does not need to be submitted with the claim but must be provided if requested for medical <a name="_bookmark86"></a>review.

1. # **- Local Medical Review Policy**
## **(Rev. 487, Issued: 03-04-05, Effective and Implementation: N/A)**

Do not develop new or revised LMRPs for clinical trial services. Clinical trial services that meet the requirements of the NCD are considered reasonable and necessary.

1. # <a name="_bookmark87"></a><a name="_bookmark88"></a>**- Billing Requirements – General**
## **(Rev. 2955, Issued: 05-14-14, Effective, 01-01-14, Implementation, 01- 06-14)**

Instruct practitioners and institutional providers to enter clinical trial and non-clinical trial services on separate line items when billing both types of services on the same claim. For services that require a Certificate of Medical Necessity (CMN), continue to require CMNs. Items and services provided free-of-charge by research sponsors generally may not be billed to be paid by Medicare, and providers are not required to submit the charge to Medicare. If it is necessary for a provider to show the items and services that are provided free-of-charge in order to receive payment for the covered routine costs (e.g. administration of a non-covered chemotherapeutic agent), providers are instructed to submit such charges as non-covered at the time of entry, while also assuring that the beneficiary is not held liable. This instruction applies to all hospitals including hospitals located in Maryland under the jurisdiction of the Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC).

For OPPS claims, providers must report a token charge for a ‘no cost’ item in the covered charge field along with the applicable HCPCS modifier (i.e., modifier –FB) appended to the procedure code that reports the service provided to furnish the ‘no cost’ item, in instances when claims processing edits require that certain devices be billed with their associated procedures. For more information on billing ‘no cost’ items under the OPPS, refer to Chapter 4, §§20.6.9 and 61.3.1 of this manual.

**NOTE:** Effective for claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2014, it is **mandatory** to report a clinical trial number on claims for items/services provided in clinical trials/studies/registries, or under CED.

Future updates will be issued in a Recurring Update Notification.

Remittance Advice Remark Code M76: “Missing/incomplete/invalid diagnosis or condition.”

Effective for clinical trial claims received after April 1, 2008, (regardless of the date of service) providers can begin to report an 8-digit clinical trial number. The reporting of this number is **voluntary** through December 31, 2013. Refer to change request (CR) 5790 for more information regarding the 8-digit number.

Effective for claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2014 it is **mandatory** to report a clinical trial number on claims for items/services provided in clinical trials/studies/registries, or under CED. Providers report the 8-digit number on the following claims locators:

Effective for clinical trial claims received after April 1, 2008, (regardless of the date of service) providers can begin to report an 8-digit clinical trial number. The reporting of this number is **voluntary** thru December 31, 2013. Refer to CR 5790 for more information regarding the 8-digit number. To bill the 8-digit clinical trial number, institutional providers shall code value code ‘D4’---where the value code amount equals the 8-digit clinical trial number. Below are the claim locators in which to bill the 8-digit number:

- 837 institutional claim format-Loop 2300 REF02 (REF01=P4)

- Paper CMS-1450 value code ‘D4’

**NOTE:** Effective for claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2014, it is **mandatory** to report a clinical trial number on claims for items/services provided in clinical trials/studies/registries, or under CED. Institutional claims submitted without a clinical trial number shall be return to providers.

**NOTE:** The Q1 modifier is line item specific and must be used to identify items and services that constitute medically necessary routine patient care or treatment of complications arising from a Medicare beneficiary’s participation in a Medicare-covered clinical trial. Items and services that are provided solely to satisfy data collection and analysis needs and that are not used in the clinical management of the patient are not covered and may not be billed using the

Q1 modifier. Items and services that are not covered by Medicare by virtue of a statutory exclusion or lack of a benefit category also may not be billed using the Q1 modifier. When billed in conjunction with the V70.7/Z00.6 diagnosis code, the Q1 modifier will serve as the provider’s attestation that the service meets the Medicare coverage criteria (i.e., was furnished to a beneficiary who is participating in a Medicare qualifying clinical trial and represents routine patient care, including complications associated with qualifying trial participation).

## <a name="inpatient clinical trial claims"></a>**Inpatient Clinical Trial Claims**

Institutional providers billing clinical trial service(s) must report ICD-9 diagnosis code V70.7 if ICD-9 is applicable or, if ICD-10-CM is applicable, ICD-10 diagnosis code Z006 in either the primary or secondary position and a condition code 30 regardless of whether all services are related to the clinical trial or not.

**NOTE:** HCPCS codes are not reported on inpatient claims. Therefore, the HCPCS modifier requirements (i.e., Q0/Q1) as outlined in the outpatient clinical trial section immediately below, are not applicable to inpatient clinical trial claims.

## **Outpatient Clinical Trial Claims**

On all outpatient clinical trial claims, providers need to do the following:

- Report condition code 30,
- Report ICD-9 diagnosis code V70.7, if ICD-9-CM is applicable, in the primary or secondary position;
- Report ICD-10 diagnosis code Z00.6, if ICD-10-CM is applicable, in the primary or secondary position; and
- Identify all lines that contain an investigational item/service with a HCPCS modifier of:

- Q0 for dates of service on or after 1/1/08

- Identify all lines that contain a routine service with a HCPCS modifier of:

- Q1 for dates of service on or after 1/1/08.

## **(Rev. 487, Issued: 03-04-05, Effective and Implementation: N/A)**

If a service Medicare covers was billed with the appropriate clinical trial coding but was inadvertently denied (e.g., for medical necessity or utilization) and is subsequently brought to your attention, adjust the denied claim. If the denied services weren’t properly coded as clinical trial services, instruct the provider to resubmit the service on a new claim with appropriate clinical trial coding.

1. # <a name="_bookmark91"></a>**- Billing and Processing Fee for Service Claims for Covered Clinical Trial Services Furnished to Managed Care Enrollees**
## **(Rev. 1723, Issued: 05-01-09, Effective: 10-01-09, Implementation: 10-05-09)**

For dates of service on or after September 19, 2000, and until notified otherwise by CMS, Medicare contractors will pay for covered clinical trial services furnished to beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans. Providers who furnish covered clinical trial services to managed care beneficiaries must be enrolled with Medicare in order to bill on a fee-for- service basis. Providers that wish to bill fee for service but have not enrolled with Medicare must contact their local carrier, intermediary, regional home health intermediary or National Supplier Clearinghouse, as appropriate, to obtain an enrollment application.

Determine payment for covered clinical trial services furnished to beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans in accordance with applicable fee for service rules, except that beneficiaries are not responsible for the Part A or Part B deductibles (i.e., assume the Part A or Part B deductible has been met). Managed care enrollees are liable for the coinsurance amounts applicable to services paid under Medicare fee for service rules.

The clinical trial coding requirements for managed care enrollee claims are the same as those for regular Medicare fee for service claims. However, for beneficiaries enrolled in a managed care plan, institutional providers must not bill outpatient clinical trial services and non- clinical trial services on the same claim. If covered outpatient services unrelated to the clinical trial are rendered during the same day/stay, the provider must split-bill so that ONLY the clinical trial services are contained on a single claim and billed as fee-for-service (this allows the Medicare claims processing system to not apply deductible when the patient is found to be in a managed care plan). Any outpatient services unrelated to the clinical trial should be billed to the managed care plan.

Submit clinical trial services for managed care enrollees to CWF for payment approval. CWF will not reject clinical trial claims for managed care enrollees when all services on the claim transaction record are coded as clinical trial services and the date(s) of service is (are) on or after September 19, 2000. In addition, CWF will not apply Part B deductible to clinical trial claims for managed care enrollees (i.e., CWF will process clinical trial services for managed care enrollees as if the Part B deductible has already been met).

If you send a claim transaction to CWF that includes both clinical and non-clinical trial services for a managed care enrollee, the entire claim will be rejected with the UR 5232 error code. When you receive a UR 5232 error code split the claim and resubmit the clinical trial portion to CWF. Process the non-clinical trial portion of the rejected claims in the same manner that other non-clinical trial fee for service claims for managed care enrollees are handled.

## **If ICD-10 is applicable, ICD-10-CM codes for the clinical trial are: Secondary ICD-10-CM Diagnosis requirement for Clinical Trial:**
Z00.6	Encounter for examination for normal comparison and control in clinical research program

The applicable TOB is 11X. A secondary diagnosis (diagnoses positions 2 – 9) of ICD-10- CM code Z00.6 (examination of participant or control in clinical research) must be present along with condition code 30 (qualifying clinical trial) Z00.6 and condition code 30 alerts the claims processing system that this is a clinical trial. The procedure is paid under inpatient prospective payment system for hospitals with patients in the trial. Deductible and coinsurance apply for fee-for- service beneficiaries.

Inpatient hospitals participating in this trial are entitled to an add-on payment of $18,848.00 for islet isolation services. This amount is in addition to the final IPPS payment made to the hospital. Should two infusions occur during the same hospital stay, Medicare will pay for two add-ons for isolation of the islet cells, but never for more than two add-ons for a hospital stay.

Inpatient hospitals shall report charges for organ acquisition in Revenue Code 0810, 0811, 0812, 0813, or 0819. This includes charges for the pre-transplant items and services related to the acquisition and delivery of the pancreatic islet cell transplants. As is Medicare’s policy with other organ transplants, Medicare contractors deduct acquisition charges prior to processing through the IPPS Pricer. Pancreata procured for islet cell transplant are not included in the prospective payment. They are paid on a reasonable cost basis. This is a pass-through cost for which interim payments may be made.

Effective for services on or after May 1, 2006, contractors shall accept the QR modifier for islet cell transplantation follow up care when performed in an outpatient department of a hospital when the transplant was done in conjunction with an NIH-sponsored clinical trial, and when billed on type of bill 13X or 85X.

All other normal inpatient billing practices apply.

**Beneficiaries**
## **(Rev. 261, Issued: 07-30-04, Effective: 10-01-04, Implementation: 10-04-04)**

CMS will make payment directly on a fee-for service basis for the routine costs of pancreatic islet cell transplants as well as transplantation and appropriate related items and services, for MA beneficiaries participating in an NIH-sponsored clinical trial. MA organizations will not be liable for payment for routine costs of this new clinical trial until MA payments can be appropriately adjusted to take into account the cost of this national coverage decision. Medicare contractors shall make payment on behalf of MA organizations directly to providers of these islet cell transplants in accordance with Medicare payment rules, except that beneficiaries are not responsible for the Part A and Part B deductibles. MA enrollees will be liable for any applicable coinsurance amounts MA organizations have in place for clinical trial benefits.

80. # <a name="_bookmark100"></a>**- Billing of the Diagnosis and Treatment of Peripheral Neuropathy with Loss of Protective Sensation in People with Diabetes**
## **(Rev. 498, Issued: 03-11-05, Effective/Implementation: N/A)**

Coverage Requirements - Peripheral neuropathy is the most common factor leading to amputation in people with diabetes. In diabetes, peripheral neuropathy is an anatomically diffuse process primarily affecting sensory and autonomic fibers; however, distal motor findings may be present in advanced cases. Long nerves are affected first, with symptoms typically beginning insidiously in the toes and then advancing proximally.

This leads to loss of protective sensation (LOPS), whereby a person is unable to feel minor trauma from mechanical, thermal, or chemical sources. When foot lesions are present, the reduction in autonomic nerve functions may also inhibit wound healing.

Peripheral neuropathy with LOPS, secondary to diabetes, is a localized illness of the feet and falls within the regulation's exception to the general exclusionary rule (see 42 C.F.R. §411.15(l)(l)(i)). Foot exams for people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy with LOPS are reasonable and necessary to allow for early intervention in serious complications that typically afflict diabetics with the disease.

Effective for services furnished on or after July 1, 2002, Medicare covers, as a physician service, an evaluation (examination and treatment) of the feet no more often than every 6 months for individuals with a documented diagnosis of diabetic sensory neuropathy and LOPS, as long as the beneficiary has not seen a foot care specialist for some other reason in the interim. LOPS shall be diagnosed through sensory testing with the

5\.07 monofilament using established guidelines, such as those developed by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases guidelines. Five sites should be tested on the plantar surface of each foot, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases guidelines. The areas must be tested randomly since the loss of protective sensation may be patchy in distribution, and the patient may get clues if the test is done rhythmically. Heavily callused areas should be avoided. As suggested by the American Podiatric Medicine Association, an absence of sensation at two or more sites out of 5 tested on either foot when tested with the 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament must be present and documented to diagnose peripheral neuropathy with loss of protective sensation.

- Hospital outpatient departments – OPPS

- Critical Access Hospital (CAH) - Method I -- Reasonable cost; Method II -- Technical - reasonable cost, Professional -- 115 percent of the fee schedule

- Rural Health Clinics/Federally Qualified Health Centers (RHCs/FQHCs) - All inclusive rate.

Deductible and coinsurance apply.

While these physician services may be appropriately provided to patients of Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (CORFs), the CORF does not bill. The services are billed by the physician on a professional claim.

Examples of Payment calculation:

Part B Deductible Met: $900 (MPFS allowed amount) x 20 percent (co-insurance) = $720 (Medicare reimbursement). Beneficiary is responsible for $180.

Part B Deductible Not met: $900 (MPFS allowed amount) - $100 (Part B deductible) = $800 x 20 percent (co-insurance) = $640 (Medicare reimbursement). Beneficiary is responsible for $260.

Part B Deductible Met: $800 (actual charged amount) x 20 percent (co-insurance) = $640 (Medicare Reimbursement), beneficiary is responsible for $160 co-insurance.

Part B Deductible Not Met: $800 (actual charged amount) - $100 (Part B deductible) = $700 x 20 percent (co- insurance) = $560 (Medicare reimbursement). Beneficiary is responsible for $240, ($100 Part B deductible and $140 co-insurance).

Services are paid at 80 percent of the lesser of the fee schedule amount or the actual charges.

This service, when furnished in an RHC/FQHC by a physician or non-physician, is considered an RHC/FQHC service. RHCs/FQHCs bill you under bill type 71X or 73X with revenue code 940 and HCPCS G0245, G0246, and G0247.

Payment should not be made for this service unless the claim contains a related visit code. Therefore, install an edit in your system to assure payment is not made for revenue code 940 unless the claim also contains a visit revenue code (520 or 521).

Applicable Revenue Codes

The applicable revenue code is 940, except for hospitals.

This service can be performed in other revenue centers such as a clinic (510) for hospitals. Therefore, instruct your hospitals to report these procedures under the revenue center where they are performed.

1. # <a name="_bookmark107"></a>**- CWF General Information**
## **(Rev. 4203, Issued: 01-18-19, Effective: 02-19-19, Implementation: 02-19-19)**

The term Medicare beneficiary identifier (Mbi) is a general term describing a beneficiary's Medicare identification number. For purposes of this manual, Medicare beneficiary identifier references both the Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) and the Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) during the new Medicare card transition period and after for certain business areas that will continue to use the HICN as part of their processes.

Though G0245 and G0246 have no technical or professional components, for these codes, CWF will post institutional claims with type of bill 13X as technical, and professional claims as professional. For bill type 85X with revenue code 940, CWF will post as technical. For 85X bill type with revenue code 98X, (Method II), CWF will post as technical and professional. This will allow both the facility and professional service payments to be approved by CWF for payment when the code and date of service match. Therefore, should a claim be received with the same code and same date of service for the same beneficiary, the second claim submitted will not be rejected as a duplicate.

Due to the billing and payment methodology of Rural Health Clinics - bill type 71X and Federally Qualified Health Centers - bill type 73X, CWF will post these claims as usual, which will correctly allow claims from these entities that are billed on institutional claims to reject as duplicates when the HCPCS code, date of service, and Medicare beneficiary identifier are an exact match with a claim billed on a professional claim.

Medicare contractors must react to these duplicate claims as they currently do for any other duplicates.

1. # <a name="_bookmark108"></a>**- CWF Utilization Edits**
## **(Rev. 1742, Issued: 05-22-09, Effective: 06-08-09, Implementation: 06-08-09)**

Edit 1 - Should CWF receive a claim from an FI for G0245 or G0246 and a second claim from a contractor for either G0245 or G0246 (or vice versa) and they are different dates of service and less than 6 months apart, the second claim will reject. CWF will edit to allow G0245 or G0246 to be paid no more than every 6 months for a particular beneficiary, regardless of who furnished the service. If G0245 has been paid, regardless of whether it was posted as a facility or professional claim, it must be 6 months before G0245 can be paid again or G0246 can be paid. If G0246 has been paid, regardless of whether it was posted as a facility or professional claim, it must be 6 months before G0246 can be paid again or G0245 can be paid. CWF will not impose limits on how many times each code can be paid for a beneficiary as long as there has been 6 months between each service.

The CWF will return a specific reject code for this edit to the contractors and FIs that will be identified in the CWF documentation. Based on the CWF reject code, the contractors and FIs must deny the claims and return the following messages:

MSN 18.4 -- This service is being denied because it has not been    months since your last examination of this kind (NOTE**:** Insert 6 as the appropriate number of months.)

RA claim adjustment reason code 96 – Non-covered charges, along with remark code M86 – Service denied because payment already made for same/similar procedure within set time frame.

Edit 2

The CWF will edit to allow G0247 to pay only if either G0245 or G0246 has been submitted and accepted as payable on the same date of service. CWF will return a specific reject code for this edit to the contractors and FIs that will be identified in the CWF documentation. Based on this reject code, contractors and FIs will deny the claims and return the following messages:

MSN 21.21 - This service was denied because Medicare only covers this service under certain circumstances.

RA claim adjustment reason code 107 – The related or qualifying claim/service was not identified on this claim.

Edit 3

Once a beneficiary’s condition has progressed to the point where routine foot care becomes a covered service, payment will no longer be made for LOPS evaluation and management services. Those services would be considered to be included in the regular exams and treatments afforded to the beneficiary on a routine basis.

The physician or provider must then just bill the routine foot care codes, per Pub 100-02, Chapter 15, §290.

The CWF will edit to reject LOPS codes G0245, G0246, and/or G0247 when on the beneficiary’s record it shows that one of the following routine foot care codes were billed and paid within the prior 6 months: 11055, 11056, 11057, 11719, 11720, and/or 11721.

The CWF will return a specific reject code for this edit to the contractors and FIs that will be identified in the CWF documentation. Based on the CWF reject code, the contractors and FIs must deny the claims and return the following messages:

MSN 21.21 - This service was denied because Medicare only covers this service under certain circumstances.

The RA claim adjustment reason code 96 – Non-covered charges, along with remark code M86 – Service denied because payment already made for same/similar procedure within set time frame.

Single AuSCT is only covered for Durie-Salmon Stage II orIII multiple myeloma patients (ICD-10-CM codes C90.00, C90.01, C90.02 and D47.Z9) that fit the following requirements:

0. Newly diagnosed or responsive multiple myeloma. This includes those patients with previously untreated disease,those with at least a partial response to prior chemotherapy (defined as a 50% decrease either in measurable paraprotein [serum and/or urine] or in bone marrow infiltration, sustained for at least 1 month), and those in responsive relapse; and

0. Adequate cardiac, renal, pulmonary, and hepatic function.



1. ## **Effective for services performed on or after March 15, 2005:**

When recognized clinical risk factors are employed to select patients for transplantation, high dose melphalan(HDM) together with AuSCT is reasonable and necessary for Medicare beneficiaries of any age group with primary amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis (ICD-10-CM codes E85.4, E85.81, E85.89 and E85.9)

who meet the following criteria:

## **(Rev. 597, Issued: 06-24-05, Effective: 04-27-05, Implementation: 08-01-05)**

An ultrasonic osteogenic stimulator is a non-invasive device that emits low intensity, pulsed ultrasound. This device is applied to the surface of the skin at the fracture site and ultrasound waves are emitted via a conductive coupling gel to stimulate fracture healing. The ultrasonic osteogenic stimulators are not to be used concurrently with other non-invasive osteogenic devices.

120. # <a name="_bookmark129"></a>**- Presbyopia-Correcting (P-C IOLS) and Astigmatism-Correcting Intraocular Lenses (A-C IOLs) (General Policy Information)**
## **(Rev. 1228; Issued: 04-27-07; Effective: 01-22-07; Implementation: 05-29-07)**

Per CMS Ruling 05-01, issued May 3, 2005, Medicare will allow beneficiaries to pay additional charges associated with insertion of a P-C IOL following cataract surgery.

- Presbyopia is a type of age-associated refractive error that results in progressive loss of the focusing power of the lens of the eye, causing difficulty seeing objects at near distance, or close-up. Presbyopia occurs as the natural lens of the eye becomes thicker and less flexible with age.

- A presbyopia-correcting IOL is indicated for primary implantation in the capsular bag of the eye for the visual correction of aphakia (absence of the lens of the eye) following cataract extraction that is intended to provide near, intermediate and distance vision without the need for eyeglasses or contact lenses.

Per CMS-1536-Ruling, effective for services on and after January 22, 2007, Medicare will allow beneficiaries to pay additional charges (which are non-covered by Medicare as these additional charges are not part of a Medicare benefit category) for insertion of an A-C IOL.

- Regular astigmatism is a visual condition where part of an image is blurred due to uneven corneal curvature. A normal cornea has the same curvature at all axes, whereas the curvature of an astigmatic cornea differs in two primary axes, resulting in vision that is distorted at all distances.

- The A-C IOL is intended to provide what is otherwise achieved by two separate items; an implantable conventional IOL (one that is not astigmatism-correcting) that is covered by Medicare, and the surgical correction, eyeglasses or contact lenses that are not covered by Medicare.

1. # <a name="_bookmark130"></a>**- Payment for Services and Supplies**
## **(Rev. 1430; Issued: 02-01-08; Effective: 01-01-08; Implementation: 03-03-08)**

For an IOL inserted following removal of a cataract in a hospital, on either an outpatient or inpatient basis, that is paid under the hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) or the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), respectively; or in a Medicare-approved ambulatory surgical center (ASC) that is paid under the ASC fee schedule:

0. Medicare does not make separate payment to the hospital or ASC for an IOL inserted subsequent to extraction of a cataract. Payment for the IOL is packaged into the payment for the surgical cataract extraction/lens replacement procedure.

0. Any person or ASC, who presents or causes to be presented a bill or request for payment for an IOL inserted during or subsequent to cataract surgery for which payment is made under the ASC fee schedule, is subject to a civil money penalty.

0. For a P-C IOL or A-C IOL inserted subsequent to removal of a cataract in a hospital, on either an outpatient or inpatient basis, that is paid under the OPPS or the IPPS, respectively; or in a Medicare- approved ASC that is paid under the ASC fee schedule:

0. The facility shall bill for the removal of a cataract with insertion of a conventional IOL, regardless of whether a conventional, P-C IOL, or A-C IOL is inserted. When a beneficiary receives a P-C or A-C IOL following removal of a cataract, hospitals and ASCs shall report the same CPT code that is used to report removal of a cataract with insertion of a conventional IOL. Physicians, hospitals and ASCs may also report an additional HCPCS code, V2788, to indicate any additional charges that accrue when a P-C IOL or A-C IOL is inserted in lieu of a conventional IOL until January 1, 2008. Effective for A-C IOL insertion services on or after January 1, 2008, physicians, hospitals and ASCs should use V2787 to report any additional charges that accrue. On or after January 1, 2008, physicians, hospitals, and ASCs should continue to report HCPCS code V2788 to indicate any additional charges that accrue for insertion of a P-C IOL. See Section 120.2 for coding guidelines.

0. There is no Medicare benefit category that allows payment of facility charges for services and supplies required to insert and adjust a P-C or A-C IOL following removal of a cataract that exceed the facility charges for services and supplies required for the insertion and adjustment of a conventional IOL.

0. There is no Medicare benefit category that allows payment of facility charges for subsequent treatments, services and supplies required to examine and monitor the beneficiary who receives a P-C or A-C IOL following removal of a cataract that exceeds the facility charges for subsequent treatments, services and supplies required to examine and monitor a beneficiary after cataract surgery followed by insertion of a conventional IOL.

## **A - For a P-C IOL or A-C IOL inserted in a physician's office**

0. A physician shall bill for a conventional IOL, regardless of a whether a conventional, P-C IOL, or A- C IOL is inserted (see section 120.2, General Billing Requirements)

0. There is no Medicare benefit category that allows payment of physician charges for services and supplies required to insert and adjust a P-C or A-C IOL following removal of a cataract that exceed the physician charges for services and supplies for the insertion and adjustment of a conventional IOL.

0. There is no Medicare benefit category that allows payment of physician charges for subsequent treatments, service and supplies required to examine and monitor a beneficiary following removal of a cataract with insertion of a P-C or A-C IOL that exceed physician charges for services and supplies to examine and monitor a beneficiary following removal of a cataract with insertion of a conventional IOL.

## **B - For a P-C IOL or A-C IOL inserted in a hospital**

0. A physician may not bill Medicare for a P-C or A-C IOL inserted during a cataract procedure performed in a hospital setting because the payment for the lens is included in the payment made to the facility for the surgical procedure.

0. There is no Medicare benefit category that allows payment of physician charges for services and supplies required to insert and adjust a P-C or A-C IOL following removal of a cataract that exceed the physician charges for services and supplies required for the insertion of a conventional IOL.

## **C - For a P-C IOL or A-C IOL inserted in an Ambulatory Surgical Center**

0. Refer to Chapter 14, Section 40.3 for complete guidance on payment for P-C IOL or A-C IOL in Ambulatory Surgical Centers.

## **(Rev. 1430; Issued: 02-01-08; Effective: 01-01-08; Implementation: 03-03-08)**

Physicians and hospitals must report one of the following Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes on the claim:

66982 - Extracapsular cataract removal with insertion of intraocular lens prosthesis (one stage procedure), manual or mechanical technique (e.g., irrigation and aspiration or phacoemulsification), complex requiring devices or techniques not generally used in routine cataract surgery (e.g., iris expansion device, suture support for intraocular lens, or primary posterior capsulorrhexis) or performed on patients in the amblyogenic development stage.

0. 66983 - Intracapsular cataract with insertion of intraocular lens prosthesis (one stage procedure)

0. 66984 - Extracapsular cataract removal with insertion of intraocular lens prosthesis (one stage procedure), manual or mechanical technique (e.g., irrigation and aspiration or phacoemulsification)

0. 66985 - Insertion of intraocular lens prosthesis (secondary implant), not associated with concurrent cataract extraction

0. 66986 - Exchange of intraocular lens

In addition, physicians inserting a P-C IOL or A-C IOL in an office setting may bill code V2632 (posterior chamber intraocular lens) for the IOL. Medicare will make payment for the lens based on reasonable cost for a conventional IOL. Place of Service (POS) = 11.

Effective for dates of service on and after January 1, 2006, physician, hospitals and ASCs may also bill the non-covered charges related to the P-C function of the IOL using HCPCS code V2788. Effective for dates of service on and after January 22, 2007 through January 1, 2008, non-covered charges related to A-C function of the IOL can be billed using HCPCS code V2788. The type of service indicator for the non-covered billed charges is Q. (The type of service is applied by the Medicare carrier and not the provider). Effective for A-C IOL insertion services on or after January 1, 2008, physicians, hospitals and ASCs should use V2787 rather than V2788 to report any additional charges that accrue.

When denying the non-payable charges submitted with V2787 or V2788, contractors shall use an appropriate Medical Summary Notice (MSN) such as 16.10 (Medicare does not pay for this item or service) and an appropriate claim adjustment reason code such as 96 (non-covered charges) for claims submitted with the non-payable charges.

Hospitals and physicians may use the proper CPT code(s) to bill Medicare for evaluation and management services usually associated with services following cataract extraction surgery, if appropriate.

## **A - Applicable Bill Types**

The hospital applicable bill types are 12X, 13X, 83X and 85X.

## **B - Other Special Requirements for Hospitals**

Hospitals shall continue to pay CAHs method 2 claims under current payment methodologies for conditional IOLs.

## **(Rev. 1228; Issued: 04-27-07; Effective: 01-22-07; Implementation: 05-29-07)**

When a beneficiary requests insertion of a P-C or A-C IOL instead of a conventional IOL following removal of a cataract:

0. Prior to the procedure to remove a cataractous lens and insert a P-C or A-C lens, the facility and the physician must inform the beneficiary that Medicare will not make payment for services that are specific to the insertion, adjustment or other subsequent treatments related to the P-C or A-C functionality of the IOL.

0. The P-C or A-C functionality of a P-C or A-C IOL does not fall into a Medicare benefit category, and, therefore, is not covered. Therefore, the facility and physician are not required to provide an Advanced Beneficiary Notice to beneficiaries who request a P-C or A-C IOL.

0. Although not required, CMS strongly encourages facilities and physicians to issue a Notice of Exclusion from Medicare Benefits to beneficiaries in order to clearly identify the non-payable aspects of a P-C or A-C IOL insertion. This notice may be found in English at http:\\cms.hhs.gov/medicare/bni/20007\_English.pdf

## **(Rev. 1228; Issued: 04-27-07; Effective: 01-22-07; Implementation: 05-29-07)**

When a beneficiary requests insertion of a P-C or A-C IOL instead of a conventional IOL following removal of a cataract and that procedure is performed, the beneficiary is responsible for payment of facility and physician charges for services and supplies attributable to the P-C or A-C functionality of the P-C or A-C IOL:

0. In determining the beneficiary's liability, the facility and	physician may take into account any additional work and resources required for insertion, fitting, vision acuity testing, and monitoring of the P-C or A-C IOL that exceed the work and resources attributable to insertion of a conventional IOL.
- The physician and the facility may not charge for cataract extraction with insertion of a P-C or A-C IOL unless the beneficiary requests this service.

- The physician and the facility may not require the beneficiary to request a P-C or A-C IOL as a condition of performing a cataract extraction with IOL insertion.

## **(Rev. 898, Issued: 03-31-06; Effective/Implementation Dates: 03-31-06)**

Commonly referred to as enhanced external counterpulsation, is a non-invasive outpatient treatment for coronary artery disease refractory medical and/or surgical therapy. Effective for dates of service July 1, 1999, and after, Medicare will cover ECP when its use is in patients with stable angina (Class III or Class IV, Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification or equivalent classification) who, in the opinion of a cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon, are not readily amenable to surgical intervention, such as PTCA or cardiac bypass, because:

- Their condition is inoperable, or at high risk of operative complications or post-operative failure;

- Their coronary anatomy is not readily amenable to such procedures; or

- They have co-morbid states that create excessive risk.

## **(Rev. 11426; Issued: 05-20-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 07-05-22)**

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) means a physician-supervised program that furnishes physician prescribed exercise; cardiac risk factor modification, including education, counseling, and behavioral intervention; psychosocial assessment; and outcomes assessment. Intensive cardiac rehabilitation (ICR) program means a physician-supervised program that furnishes CR and has shown, in peer-reviewed published research, that it improves patients’ cardiovascular disease through specific outcome measurements described in 42 CFR 410.49(c). Effective January 1, 2010, Medicare Part B pays for CR/ICR if specific criteria are met by the Medicare beneficiary, the CR/ICR program itself, the setting in which it is administered, and the physician administering the program.

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) means a physician-supervised program for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and certain other chronic respiratory diseases designed to optimize physical and social performance and autonomy. Effective January 1, 2010, Medicare Part B pays for PR if specific criteria are met by the Medicare beneficiary, the PR program itself, the setting in which it is administered, and the physician administering the program, as outlined below.

- Have had a heart or heart-lung transplant.

Effective for dates of services on or after March 22, 2006, services provided in connection with a CR exercise program may be considered reasonable and necessary for up to 36 sessions. Patients generally receive 2 to 3 sessions per week for 12 to 18 weeks. The contractor has discretion to cover CR beyond 18 weeks. Coverage must not exceed a total of 72 sessions for 36 weeks.

CR programs shall be performed incident to physician’s services in outpatient hospitals, or outpatient settings such as clinics or offices. Follow the policies for services incident to the services of a physician as they apply in each setting. For example, see Pub. 100-02, Chapter 6, §2.4.1, and Pub. 100-02, Chapter 15, §60.1. (Refer to Publication 100-03, §20.10 for further coverage guidelines.)

1. # **- Coding Requirements for Cardiac Rehabilitation Services Furnished On or Before Dec. 31, 2009**
## **(Rev. 11426; Issued: 05-20-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 07-05-22)**

The following are the applicable Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes:

93797 - Physician services for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation; without continuous ECG monitoring (per session); and

93798 - Physician services for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation; with continuous ECG monitoring (per session).

Effective for dates of service on or after January 1, 2008, and before January 1, 2010, providers and practitioners may report more than one unit of CPT code 93797 or 97398 for a date of service if more than one CR session lasting at least 1 hour each is provided on the same day. In order to report more than one session for a given date of service, each session must last a minimum of 60 minutes. For example, if the CR provided on a given day total 1 hour and 50 minutes, then only one session should be billed to report the CR provided on that day.

1. # <a name="_bookmark139"></a>**– Cardiac Rehabilitation Program Services Furnished On or After January 1, 2010**
## **(Rev. 11426; Issued: 05-20-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 07-05-22)**

As specified at 42 CFR 410.49, Medicare Part B covers CR for beneficiaries who have experienced one or more of the following:

- An acute MI within the preceding 12 months;
- A coronary artery bypass surgery;
- Current stable angina pectoris;
- Heart valve repair or replacement;
- PTCA or coronary stenting;
- A heart or heart-lung transplant;
- Stable, chronic heart failure defined as patients with left ventricular ejection fraction

of 35% or less and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV symptoms despite being on optimal heart failure therapy for at least 6 weeks, on or after February 18, 2014; or,

- Other cardiac conditions as specified through a national coverage determination (NCD).

CR must include all of the following components:

- Physician-prescribed exercise each day CR items and services are furnished.
- Cardiac risk factor modification, including education, counseling, and behavioral intervention, tailored to the individual’s needs.
- Psychosocial assessment.
- Outcomes assessment.
- An individualized treatment plan detailing how components are utilized for each

patient. The individualized treatment plan must be established, reviewed, and signed by a physician every 30 days.

Medicare Part B pays for CR in a physician’s office or a hospital outpatient setting. All settings must have a physician immediately available and accessible for medical consultations and emergencies at all times when items and services are being furnished under the program. This provision is satisfied if the physician meets the requirements for direct supervision for physician office services, at 42 CFR 410.26, and for hospital outpatient services at 42 CFR 410.27.

As specified at 42 CFR 410.49(f)(1), the number of CR sessions are limited to a maximum of 2 1-hour sessions per day for up to 36 sessions over up to 36 weeks with the option for an additional 36 sessions over an extended period of time if approved by the

Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC).

1. # <a name="_bookmark140"></a>**– Coding Requirements for CR Services Furnished On or After January 1, 2010**
## **(Rev. 11426; Issued: 05-20-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 07-05-22)**

The following are the applicable Current Procedural Technology (CPT) codes for CR services:

**93797** Physician or other qualified health care professional services for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation; without continuous ECG monitoring (Per Session)

**93798** Physician or other qualified care health professional services for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation; with continuous ECG monitoring (Per Session)

Effective for dates of service on or after January 1, 2010, hospitals and practitioners may report a maximum of 2 1-hour sessions per day. In order to report one session of CR in a day, the duration of treatment must be at least 31 minutes. Two sessions of CR may only be reported in the same day if the duration of treatment is at least 91 minutes. In other words, the first session would account for 60 minutes and the second session would account for at least 31 minutes if two sessions are reported. If several shorter periods of CR are furnished on a given day, the minutes of service during those periods must be added together for reporting in 1-hour session increments.

**Example**: If the patient receives 20 minutes of CR in the day, no CR session may be reported because less than 31 minutes of services were

furnished.

**Example**: If a patient receives 20 minutes of CR in the morning and 35 minutes of CR in the afternoon of a single day, the hospital or practitioner would report 1 session of CR under 1 unit of the appropriate CPT code for the total duration of 55 minutes of CR on that day.

**Example**: If the patient receives 70 minutes of CR in the morning and 25 minutes of CR in the afternoon of a single day, the hospital or practitioner would report two sessions of CR under the appropriate CPT code(s) because the total duration of CR on that day of 95 minutes exceeds 90 minutes.

**Example**: If the patient receives 70 minutes of CR in the morning and 85 minutes of CR in the afternoon of a single day, the hospital or practitioner would report two sessions of CR under the appropriate CPT code(s) for the total duration of CR of 155 minutes. A maximum of two sessions per day may be reported, regardless of the total duration of CR.

1. # <a name="_bookmark141"></a>**– Claims Processing Requirements for Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) and Intensive Cardiac Rehabilitation (ICR) Services Furnished On or After January 1, 2010**
## **(Rev. 11426; Issued: 05-20-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 07-05-22)**

**NOTE**: A beneficiary may switch from an ICR program to a CR program. The beneficiary is limited to a one-time switch, multiple switches are not allowable. Once the beneficiary switches from ICR to CR he or she will be limited to the number of sessions remaining in the program. For example, a beneficiary who switches from ICR to CR after 12 sessions will have 24 sessions of CR remaining, (i.e., 12 sessions of ICR + 24 sessions of CR = total of 36 sessions). Should a beneficiary experience more than one indication simultaneously, he or she may participate in a single series of CR or ICR sessions (i.e., a patient who had a MI within 12 months and currently experiences stable angina is entitled to one series of CR sessions, up to 36 1-hour sessions with contractor discretion for an additional 36 sessions; or one series of ICR sessions, up to 72 1-hour sessions over a period up to 18 weeks). Beneficiaries may not switch from CR to ICR. Upon completion of a CR or ICR program, beneficiaries must experience another indication in order to be eligible for coverage of more CR or ICR.

Contractors shall accept the inclusion of the -KX modifier on the claim line(s) as an attestation by the provider of the service that documentation is on file verifying that further treatment beyond 36 sessions of CR up to a total of 72 sessions meets the requirements of the medical policy or, for ICR, that any further sessions beyond 72 sessions within a 126-day period counting from the date of the first session, or for any sessions provided after 126 days from the date of the first session, meet the requirements of the medical policy. Beneficiaries who switch from ICR to CR may also be eligible for up to 72 combined sessions with contractor discretion for CR sessions after 36 (to include completed ICR sessions prior to switch). In these cases, and consistent with the information above, the -KX modifier must be included on the claim should the beneficiary participate in more than 36 CR sessions following the switch.

See Pub. 100-06, Medicare Financial Management Manual, chapter 6, section 420, and Pub. 100-02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 15, section 232, and Pub. 100-08, Medicare Program Integrity Manual, chapter 10, section 10.2.2.5 for detailed information regarding CR and ICR policy and claims processing.

- An acute MI within the preceding 12 months;
- A coronary artery bypass surgery;
- Current stable angina pectoris;
- Heart valve repair or replacement;
- PTCA or coronary stenting;
- A heart or heart-lung transplant;
- Stable, chronic heart failure defined as patients with left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less and NYHA class II to IV symptoms despite being on optimal heart failure therapy for at least 6 weeks, on or after February 9, 2018; or,
- Other cardiac conditions as specified through an NCD. The NCD process may also be used to specify non-coverage of a cardiac condition for ICR if coverage is not supported by clinical evidence.

ICR must include all of the following components:

- Physician-prescribed exercise each day CR items and services are furnished.
- Cardiac risk factor modification, including education, counseling, and behavioral intervention, tailored to the individual’s needs.
- Psychosocial assessment.
- Outcomes assessment.
- An individualized treatment plan detailing how components are utilized for each patient. The individualized treatment plan must be established, reviewed, and signed by a physician every 30 days.

A list of approved ICR programs, identified through the NCD process, will be listed in the Federal Register and is available on the CMS website at [https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/MedicareApprovedFacilitie/ICR) [Information/MedicareApprovedFacilitie/ICR.](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/MedicareApprovedFacilitie/ICR) In order to be approved, a program must demonstrate through peer-reviewed, published research that it has accomplished one or more of the following for its patients:

- Positively affected the progression of coronary heart disease.
- Reduced the need for coronary bypass surgery.
- Reduced the need for percutaneous coronary interventions.

An ICR program must also demonstrate through peer-reviewed published research that it accomplished a statistically significant reduction in 5 or more of the following measures for patients from their levels before CR services to after CR services:

- Low density lipoprotein.
- Triglycerides.
- Body mass index.
- Systolic blood pressure.
- Diastolic blood pressure.
- The need for cholesterol, blood pressure, and diabetes medications.

Medicare Part B pays for ICR in a physician’s office or a hospital outpatient setting. All settings must have a physician immediately available and accessible for medical consultations and emergencies at all times when items and services are being furnished under the program. This provision is satisfied if the physician meets the requirements for direct supervision for physician office services, at 42 CFR 410.26, and for hospital outpatient services at 42 CFR 410.27.

As specified at 42 CFR 410.49(f)(2), ICR sessions are limited to 72 1-hour sessions (as defined in section 1848(b)(5) of the Act), up to 6 sessions per day, over a period of up to 18 weeks.

## **(Rev. 11426; Issued: 05-20-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 07-05-22)**


The following are the applicable HCPCS codes for ICR:

G0422 (Intensive cardiac rehabilitation; with or without continuous ECG monitoring, with exercise, per hour, per session)

G0423 (Intensive cardiac rehabilitation; with or without continuous ECG monitoring, without exercise, per hour, per session)

Effective for dates of service on or after January 1, 2010, hospitals and practitioners may report a maximum of 6 1-hour sessions per day. In order to report one session of ICR in a day, the duration of treatment must be at least 31 minutes. Additional sessions of ICR beyond the first session may only be reported in the same day if the duration of treatment is 31 minutes or greater beyond the hour increment. In other words, in order to report 6 sessions of ICR on a given date of service, the first five sessions would account for 60 minutes each and the sixth session would account for at least 31 minutes. If several shorter periods of ICR are furnished on a given day, the minutes of service during those periods must be added together for reporting in 1-hour session

increments.

**Example**: If the patient receives 20 minutes of ICR in the day, no ICR session may be reported because less than 31 minutes of services were furnished.

**Example**: If a patient receives 20 minutes of ICR in the morning and 35 minutes of ICR in the afternoon of a single day, the hospital or practitioner would report 1 session of ICR under 1 unit of the appropriate HCPCS code for the total duration of 55 minutes of ICR on that day.

**Example**: If the patient receives 70 minutes of ICR in the morning and 25 minutes of ICR in the afternoon of a single day, the hospital or practitioner would report two sessions of ICR under the appropriate HCPCS code(s) because the total duration of ICR on that day of 95 minutes exceeds 90 minutes.

**Example**: If the patient receives 70 minutes of ICR in the morning and 85 minutes of ICR in the afternoon of a single day, the hospital or practitioner would report three sessions of ICR under the appropriate HCPCS code(s) because the total duration of ICR on that day is 155 minutes, which exceeds 150 minutes and is less than 211 minutes.

- Who have had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and experience persistent symptoms that include respiratory dysfunction for at least four weeks (effective January 1, 2022);
- Additional medical indications for coverage for PR may be established through an NCD.

PR must include all of the following components:

- Physician-prescribed exercise during each pulmonary rehabilitation session.
- Education or training that is closely and clearly related to the individual’s care and treatment which is tailored to the individual’s needs and assists in achievement of goals toward independence in activities of daily living, adaptation to limitations and improved quality of life. Education must include information on respiratory problem management and, if appropriate, brief smoking cessation counseling.
- Psychosocial assessment.
- Outcomes assessment.
- An individualized treatment plan detailing how components are utilized for each patient. The individualized treatment plan must be established, reviewed, and signed by a physician every 30 days.

Medicare Part B pays for PR in a physician’s office or a hospital outpatient setting. All settings must have the following: (i) A physician immediately available and accessible for medical consultations and emergencies at all times when items and services are being furnished under the program. This provision is satisfied if the physician meets the requirements for direct supervision for physician office services, at 42 CFR 410.26, and for hospital outpatient services at 42 CFR 410.27, and, (ii) The necessary cardio-pulmonary, emergency, diagnostic, and therapeutic life-saving equipment accepted by the medical community as medically necessary (for example, oxygen, cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment, and defibrillator) to treat chronic respiratory disease.

As specified at 42 CFR 410.47(e), the number of PR sessions are limited to a maximum of 2 1-hour sessions per day for up to 36 sessions over up to 36 weeks with the option for an additional 36 sessions over an extended period of time if approved by the MACs.

94625 (Physician or other qualified health care professional services for outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation; without continuous oximetry monitoring (per session))

94626 (Physician or other qualified health care professional services for outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation; with continuous oximetry monitoring (per session)

Effective for dates of service on or after January 1, 2010, hospitals and practitioners may report a maximum of 2 1-hour sessions per day. In order to report one session of PR in a day, the duration of treatment must be at least 31 minutes. Two sessions of PR may only be reported in the same day if the duration of treatment is at least 91 minutes. In other words, the first session would account for 60 minutes and the second session would account for at least 31 minutes, if two sessions are reported. If several shorter periods of PR are furnished on a

given day, the minutes of service during those periods must be added together for reporting in 1-hour session increments.

**Example**: If the patient receives 20 minutes of PR in the day, no PR session may be reported because less than 31 minutes of services were furnished.

**Example**: If a patient receives 20 minutes of PR in the morning and 35 minutes of PR in the afternoon of a single day, the hospital or practitioner would report 1 session of PR under 1 unit of HCPCS code/CPT code for the total duration of 55 minutes of PR on that day.

**Example**: If the patient receives 70 minutes of pulmonary rehabilitation services in the morning and 25 minutes of pulmonary rehabilitation services in the afternoon of a single day, the hospital or practitioner would report two sessions of pulmonary rehabilitation services under the HCPCS G-code/CPT codes because the total duration of pulmonary rehabilitation services on that day of 95 minutes exceeds 90 minutes.

**Example**: If the patient receives 70 minutes of pulmonary rehabilitation services in the morning and 85 minutes of pulmonary rehabilitation services in the afternoon of a single day, the hospital or practitioner would report two sessions of pulmonary rehabilitation services under the HCPCS G-code/CPT codes for the total duration of pulmonary rehabilitation services of 155 minutes.

1. # **- Claims Guidance for Payment**
## **(Rev. 11021; Issued: 10-01-21; Effective: 10-29-21; Implementation: 10-29-21)**

**Covered Bariatric Surgery Procedures for Treatment of Co-Morbid Conditions Related to Morbid Obesity**

Contractors shall process covered bariatric surgery claims as follows:

1. Identify bariatric surgery claims.

Contractors identify inpatient bariatric surgery claims by the presence of ICD-10 diagnosis code E66.01as the primary diagnosis (for morbid obesity) and one of the covered ICD-10 procedure codes listed in

§150.3.

Contractors identify practitioner bariatric surgery claims by the presence of ICD-10 diagnosis code E66.01 as the primary diagnosis (for morbid obesity) and one of the covered HCPCS procedure codes listed in

§150.2.

1. Perform facility certification validation for all bariatric surgery claims on a pre-pay basis up to and including date of service September 23, 2013.


A list of approved facilities are found at the link noted in section 150.1, section A, above.

1. Review bariatric surgery claims data and determine whether a pre- or post-pay sample of bariatric surgery claims need further review to assure that the beneficiary has a BMI ≥35 (Z68.35-Z68.45) (see ICD- 10 equivalents above in section 150.5), and at least one co-morbidity related to obesity.

The A/B MAC medical director may define the appropriate method for addressing the obesity-related co-morbid requirement.

Effective for dates of service on and after September 24, 2013, CMS has removed the certified facility requirements for Bariatric Surgery for Treatment of Co-Morbid Conditions Related to Morbid Obesity.

**NOTE:** If ICD-10 diagnosis code E66.01 is present, but a covered procedure code (listed in §150.2 or §150.3) is/are not present, the claim is not for bariatric surgery and should be processed under normal procedures.

**NOTE:** If ICD-10 diagnosis code E66.01 is present, but a covered procedure code (listed in §150.2 or

§150.3) is/are not present, the claim is not for bariatric surgery and should be processed under normal procedures.

1. # <a name="_bookmark167"></a>**- A/MAC Billing Requirements**

## **(Rev. 2841, Issued: 12-23-13, Effective: 09-24-13, Implementation: 12-17-13)**

The A/MAC billing requirements will pay for bariatric surgery only when the services are submitted on the following type of bill (TOB): 11X. Type of facility and setting determines the basis of payment:

- For services performed in Indian Health Services inpatient hospitals, TOB 11X under the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) is based on the diagnosis-related group (DRG).

- For services performed in inpatient hospitals, TOB 11X under IPPS is based on the DRG.

- For services performed in IHS critical access hospitals (CAHs), TOB 11X, payment is based on 101% facility specific per diem rate.

- For services performed in CAH inpatient hospitals, TOB 11X, payment is based on 101% of reasonable cost.

1. # <a name="_bookmark168"></a>**- Advance Beneficiary Notice and HINN Information**
## **(Rev. 1233, Issued: 04-27-07, Effective: 02-21-06, Implementation: 05-29-07)**

Physicians must be advised that the physician is liable for charges if the surgery is performed in an unapproved facility, unless the beneficiary was informed that he or she would be financially responsible prior to performance for the procedure. The provider must have the beneficiary sign an advance beneficiary notice (ABN) if the bariatric surgery is performed in an unapproved facility. Note that the ABN is the appropriate notice for Part B services.

The HINN model language should be adapted to this situation in the sections addressing: description of the care at issue if the surgery is performed on an inpatient basis, in an unapproved facility, to avoid being liable, the provider must issue a HINN. Other content requirements of HINN still apply. Use the HINN letter most appropriate to the overall situation.

160. # <a name="_bookmark169"></a>**– PTA for Implanting the Carotid Stent**
**(Rev. 1042, Issued: 08-25-06; Effective: 03-17-05; Implementation: 10-02-06)**

1. # <a name="_bookmark170"></a>**– Category B Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Study Coverage**
## **(Rev. 1925; Issued: 03-05-10; Effective Date: 12-09-09; Implementation Date: 04-05-10)**

Effective July 1, 2001, Medicare covers percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the carotid artery concurrent with stent placement when furnished in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) protocols governing Category B Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) studies.

The billing for this procedure is based upon how the service is delivered. There are several CPT codes that may be billed depending upon how the procedure is performed. Contractor medical directors should consider what provider education information is needed to assist providers on the billing for this service.

Contractors must review their local coverage determinations to ensure that payment is provided for claims for PTA in an FDA-approved clinical study and deny any claims for services for PTA of the carotid artery when provided outside of an FDA-approved clinical study.

As a requirement for Category B IDE coverage, providers must bill a six-digit IDE Number that begins with a “G” (i.e., G123456). To identify the line as an IDE line, institutional providers must bill this IDE Number on a 0624 Revenue Code line while practitioners must bill this IDE Number along with a Q0 modifier.

1. # <a name="_bookmark171"></a>**– Post-Approval Study Coverage**
## **(Rev. 1925; Issued: 03-05-10; Effective Date: 12-09-09; Implementation Date: 04-05-10)**

Effective October 12, 2004, Medicare covers PTA of the carotid artery concurrent with the placement of an FDA-approved carotid stent and an FDA-approved or –cleared embolic protection device (effective December 9, 2009) for an FDA-approved indication when furnished in accordance with FDA-approved protocols governing post-approval studies. Billing post-approval studies is similar to normal Category B IDE billing procedures, except that under post-approval coverage, providers must bill the Pre-Market Approval (PMA) number assigned to the stent system by the FDA. PMA numbers are like typical IDE Numbers in that they have six-digits, but they begin with a “P” (i.e., P123456) instead of a “G.”

1. # <a name="_bookmark172"></a>**– Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS) for Post-Approval Studies**
## **(Rev. 11021; Issued: 10-01-21; Effective: 10-29-21; Implementation: 10-29-21)**

1. **Background**

As the post-approval studies began to end, CMS received requests to extend coverage for the post- approval studies. CMS has reviewed the extension requests and has determined that patients participating in post-approval extension studies are also included in the currently covered population of patients participating in FDA-approved post-approval studies.

1. ## <a name="b. policy"></a>**Policy**

To grant approval for post-approval studies, the FDA reviews each study protocol. Once approval is granted, the FDA issues a formal approval letter to the study sponsor.

Extensions of post-approval studies are not subject to approval by the FDA because they surpass the post- approval study requirements identified in the conditions of approval for post-approval studies. Since the FDA cannot approve these extension studies, individual Post-Market Approval (PMA) numbers cannot be issued to separately identify each study. Currently, in order to receive reimbursement for procedures performed as part of a carotid artery stenting post-approval study, providers must include the FDA-issued PMA number on each claim to indicate participation in a specific study.


CMS has determined that all extension studies must be reviewed by the FDA. The FDA will issue an acknowledgement letter stating that the extension study is scientifically valid and will generate clinically relevant post-market data. Upon receipt of this letter and review of the extension study protocol, CMS will issue a letter to the study sponsor indicating that the study under review will be covered by Medicare. Since an individual PMA number cannot be assigned by the FDA to each extension study, these studies will use the PMA number assigned to the original FDA-approved post-approval study (i.e., CAPTURE 2 shall use the PMA number assigned to CAPTURE 1).

1. ## <a name="c. billing"></a>**Billing**

In order to receive Medicare coverage for patients participating in post-approval extension studies, providers shall submit both the FDA acknowledgement letter and the CMS letter providing coverage for the extension study to their contractor. Additionally, providers shall submit any other materials contractors would require for FDA-approved post- approval studies.

In response, contractors will issue a letter assigning an effective date for each facility’s participation in the extension study. Providers may bill for procedures performed in the extension study for dates of service on and after the assigned effective date. Providers billing A/B MACs (A) must bill using the most current ICD-10-CM is applicable, Indications for PTA of the Carotid Artery Concurrent with Stenting (must bill one of these primary codes to meet coverage under 20.7B2, 20.7B3, 20.7B4)

1. # <a name="_bookmark173"></a>**– Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS) With Embolic Protection Coverage**
## **(Rev. 1925; Issued: 03-05-10; Effective Date: 12-09-09; Implementation Date: 04-05-10)**

Effective March 17, 2005, Medicare covers PTA of the carotid artery concurrent with the placement of an FDA-approved carotid stent with embolic protection under specific patient indications found in Pub. 100-03, Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual, part 1, section 20.7. Coverage is limited to procedures performed using FDA-approved CAS systems and FDA-approved or –cleared (effective December 9, 2009) embolic protection devices (EPDs). If deployment of the EPD is not technically possible, and not performed, then the procedure is not covered.

In addition to the specific patient indications, CMS determined that CAS with embolic protection is reasonable and necessary only if performed in facilities that have been determined to be competent in performing the evaluation, procedure, and follow-up necessary to ensure optimal patient outcomes. CMS created a list of minimum standards modeled in part on professional society statements on competency. All facilities must at least meet CMS’s standards in order to receive coverage for CAS for high-risk patients.

Facilities must recertify every 2 years in order to maintain coverage of CAS procedures.

1. # **– 510k Post-Approval Extension Studies using 510k-Cleared Embolic Protection Devices during Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS) Procedures**
## **(Rev. 11021; Issued: 10-01-21; Effective: 10-29-21; Implementation: 10-29-21)**

1. Background

As explained above in section 160.2, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued instructions in 2004 for processing claims for carotid artery stenting (CAS) procedures performed in Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved post-approval studies. As the post-approval studies began to end, CMS received requests to extend coverage for the post-approval studies. As explained above in section 160.2.1, CMS reviewed the extension requests and determined that patients participating in post-approval

extension studies were also included in the covered population of patients participating in FDA-approved post-approval studies.

Recently, the FDA issued 510k approvals for proximal embolic protection devices (EPDs) which are utilized in CAS procedures. Utilization of an EPD is required in the Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) national coverage determination (NCD) at Pub. 100-03, chapter 1, section 20.7. However the 510k process does not involve a post- approval study requirement as traditional FDA marketing approvals require. CMS received requests to include patients participating in studies following the FDA 510k approval of these devices under NCD 20.7. CMS subsequently determined that these patients, similar to patients covered in traditional post-approval extension studies, are eligible for coverage under the current coverage policy at NCD 20.7.

The FDA does not require devices approved through the 510k process to undergo further study following clearance. As such, 510k post-approval extension studies are neither required by the FDA or subject to FDA approval. However, for the purposes of study review, the FDA evaluates traditional post-approval extension studies and 510k post- approval extension studies via the Pre-Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) process. As a result of the Pre-IDE process, each study is assigned and identified by a single, 6-digit pre-IDE number, preceded by the letter ‘I’ (i.e. I123456).

1. Policy

Effective October 22, 2010, CMS has determined that all 510k post-approval extension studies must be reviewed by the FDA. The FDA will issue an acknowledgement letter stating that the extension study is scientifically valid and will generate clinically relevant post-market data. Upon receipt of this letter and review of the 510k post-approval extension study protocol, CMS will issue a letter to the study sponsor indicating that the study under review will be covered by Medicare. Since the FDA evaluates these studies via the Pre-IDE process, each 510k post-approval extension study will be identified by the ‘I’ number assigned to the study when submitted to the FDA for review (i.e., the FREEDOM study examining the 510k-cleared Gore Flow Reversal System was assigned I090962 and will be identified as such on all claims).

1. Billing

In order to receive Medicare coverage for patients participating in 510k post-approval extension studies, providers shall follow the same processes as explained above in section

160\.2.1 (CAS for Post-Approval Studies). The only difference is that providers must report 510k-cleared devices with a pre-IDE number beginning with an “I”, instead of an IDE number beginning with a “P” (post-market approval).

Contractors will issue a letter assigning an effective date for each facility’s participation in the extension study. Providers may bill for procedures performed in the extension study for dates of service on and after the assigned effective date utilizing the most current ICD-10 CM procedure codes.

160. # <a name="_bookmark174"></a>**- Intracranial Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) With Stenting**
## **(Rev. 11021; Issued: 10-01-21; Effective: 10-29-21; Implementation: 10-29-21)**

1. **Background**

In the past, PTA to treat obstructive lesions of the cerebral arteries was non-covered by Medicare because the safety and efficacy of the procedure had not been established. This national coverage determination (NCD) meant that the procedure was also non-covered for beneficiaries participating in Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved investigational device exemption (IDE) clinical trials.

1. ## **Policy**

On February 9, 2006, a request for reconsideration of this NCD initiated a national coverage analysis. CMS reviewed the evidence and determined that intracranial PTA with stenting is reasonable and necessary under §1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act for the treatment of cerebral vessels (as specified in [The](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/downloads/ncd103c1_Part1.pdf) [National Coverage Determinations](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/downloads/ncd103c1_Part1.pdf) [Manual, Chapter 1, part 1, section 20.7](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/downloads/ncd103c1_Part1.pdf)) only when furnished in accordance with FDA- approved protocols governing Category B IDE clinical trials. All other indications for intracranial PTA with stenting remain non-covered.


- ## <a name="• billing"></a>**Billing**

Providers of covered intracranial PTA with stenting shall use Category B IDE billing requirements, as listed above in section 68.4. In addition to these requirements, providers must bill the appropriate procedure and diagnosis codes for the date of service to receive payment.

See the below ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes list applies, depending on the date of

service. Indications for PTA and Stenting of Intracranial Arteries (must bill I67.2 and one of these primary codes to meet coverage under 20.7B5)

If ICD-10-CM is applicable:

|I67.2	Cerebral atherosclerosis|
| :- |
|I66.01 Occlusion and stenosis of right middle cerebral artery|
|I66.02 Occlusion and stenosis of left middle cerebral artery|
|I66.03 Occlusion and stenosis of bilateral middle cerebral arteries|
|I66.11 Occlusion and stenosis of right anterior cerebral artery|
|I66.12 Occlusion and stenosis of left anterior cerebral artery|
|I66.13 Occlusion and stenosis of bilateral anterior cerebral arteries|
|I66.21 Occlusion and stenosis of right posterior cerebral artery|
|I66.22 Occlusion and stenosis of left posterior cerebral artery|
|I66.23 Occlusion and stenosis of bilateral posterior cerebral arteries|
|I66.8	Occlusion and stenosis of other cerebral arteries|
|I63.59 Cerebral infarction due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of other cerebral artery|


If ICD-10-PCS is applicable, ICD-10-PCS procedure codes.

That is, under Part A, providers must bill intracranial PTA using if ICD-10-PCS procedure codes is applicable.

The A/B MAC (A) will pay for LADR when approved under the IDE/clinical trial criteria only when submitted with ICD-9-CM procedure code 84.65 if ICD-9 is applicable, with condition code 30 and if ICD-9- CM is applicable*,* ICD-9-CM diagnosis code V70.7 when submitted on type of bill (TOB) 11X from May 16, 2006 through August 13, 2007.

Special Billing instructions:

For services performed on TOB 11X in critical access hospitals (CAH), the payment will be 101% of reasonable cost.

For services performed on TOB 11X Indian Health Services (IHS) inpatient hospitals will pay under the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) based on the DRG.

For services performed on TOB 11X, IHS CAHs will pay under 101% facility specific per diem rate.

**NOTE:** The ICD-9-CM procedure code 84.65 is not payable for beneficiaries over 60 years of age, with the Charite<sup>TM</sup> lumbar artificial disc, which is the only one that is FDA approved for any diagnosis.

Effective for discharges on or after August 14, 2007, CMS has found that LADR is not reasonable and necessary for the Medicare population over 60 years of age. Therefore, LADR is non-covered for Medicare beneficiaries over 60 years of age as identified in section 150.10, of Pub.100-03, the NCD Manual. A/B MACS (A) shall deny claims with ICD-9-CM procedure code 84.65 for Medicare beneficiaries over 60 years of age.

For Medicare beneficiaries 60 years of age and younger, there is no NCD, leaving such determinations to continue to be made by the local contractors.

## **(Rev. 1340, Issued: 09-21-07, Effective: 08-14-07, Implementation: 10-01-07)**

Contractors shall use the following messages when denying claims for Medicare beneficiaries over 60 years of

st

age (i.e. on or after a beneficiary’s 61 birthday).

21\.24  “This service is not covered for patients over age 60.”

“Este servicio no está cubierto en pacientes mayores de 60 años.” Use an appropriate Claim Adjustment Reason Code:

96	"Non-covered charge(s)."

Use an appropriate Remittance Advice Remark Code:

N386 “This decision was based on a National Coverage Determination (NCD). An NCD provides a coverage determination as to whether a particular item or service is covered. A copy of this policy is available at [http://www.cms.hhs.gov/mcd/search.asp.](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/mcd/search.asp) If you do not have Web access, you may contact the contractor to request a copy of the NCD.”

1. # <a name="_bookmark179"></a>**- Advance Beneficiary Notice (ABN) and Hospital Issued Notice of Noncoverage (HINN) Information**
## **(Rev. 1340, Issued: 09-21-07, Effective: 08-14-07, Implementation: 10-01-07)**

Providers must be advised that the provider is liable for charges if the lumbar artificial disc replacement is used in the surgery, unless the beneficiary was informed that he/she would be financially responsible prior to performance of the procedure. To avoid this liability the provider should have the beneficiary sign an ABN.

The HINN model language should be adapted to this situation in the sections addressing description of the care at issue if the surgery is performed on an inpatient basis. Unless the beneficiary was informed prior to the admission that he/ she would be financially liable for the admission, the provider is liable. To avoid this liability the provider must issue a HINN. Other content requirements of a HINN still apply. Use the HINN letter most appropriate to the overall situation.

## **(Rev. 2998, Issued: 07-25-14, Effective: Upon implementation of ICD-10; 01-01-12 - ASC X12, Implementation: 08-25-2014 - ASC X12; Upon Implementation of ICD-10)**

Claims for cryosurgery for the prostate gland are to be submitted on the ASC X12 837, or, in exceptional circumstances, on a hard copy Form CMS – 1450. This procedure can be rendered in an inpatient or outpatient hospital setting (types of bill (TOBs) 11x 13x, 83x, and 85x).

The A/B MAC (A) will look for the following when processing claims with cryosurgery services:

0. If ICD-9-CM is applicable, ICD-9 CM diagnosis code 185 or

0. If ICD-10-CM is applicable, ICD-10 CM diagnosis code C61 must be on all cryosurgical claims;

0. For outpatient claims HCPCS 55873 and revenue codes 0360, 0361, or 0369 Cryosurgery ablation of localized prostate cancer, stages T1- T3 (includes ultrasonic guidance for interstitial cryosurgery probe placement, postoperative irrigations and aspiration of sloughing tissue included) must be on all outpatient claims; and

0. For inpatient claims correct procedure codes are:

0. If ICD-9-CM is applicable, ICD-9-CM procedure code 60.62 (perineal prostatectomy- the definition includes cryoablation of prostate, cryostatectomy of prostate, and radical cryosurgical ablation of prostate)

0. If ICD-10 is applicable,ICD-10-PCS procedure code 0V500ZZ (Destruction of Prostate, Open Approach), or 0V503ZZ (Destruction of Prostate, Percutaneous Approach), or 0V504ZZ (Destruction of Prostate, Percutaneous Endoscopic Approach).

1. # <a name="_bookmark183"></a>**– Payment Requirements**
## **(Rev. 1111, Issued: 11-09-06, Effective: 04-01-07, Implementation: 04-02-07)**

This service may be paid as a primary treatment for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer, Stages T1 – T3. The ultrasonic guidance associated with this procedure will not be paid for separately, but is bundled into the payment for the surgical procedure. When one provider has furnished the cryosurgical ablation and another the ultrasonic guidance, the provider of the ultrasonic guidance must seek compensation from the provider of the cryosurgical ablation.

Effective July 1, 2001, cryosurgery performed as salvage therapy, will be paid only according to the coverage requirements described above.

Type of facility and setting determines the basis of payment:

## **(Rev. 1271, Issued: 06-22-07; Effective: 05-04-07; Implementation: 07-23-07)**

VNS is a pulse generator, similar to a pacemaker, that is surgically implanted under the skin of the left chest and an electrical lead (wire) is connected from the generator to the left vagus nerve. Electrical signals are sent from the battery-powered generator to the vagus nerve via the lead. These signals are in turn sent to the brain. FDA approved VNS for treatment of refractory epilepsy in 1999. Further coverage guidelines can be found in the National Coverage Determination Manual (Publication 100-03), Chapter 1, Section 160.18. Since the HCPCS codes for VNS can also be used for other indications, contractors must determine if the service being billed are for VNS and make a determination to pay or deny. CMS guidance on payment is listed below.

Information regarding these NCDs can be found in Publication (Pub.) 100-03, Chapter 1, sections 140.6, 140.7, and 140.8, respectively.

Inpatient Claims

Hospitals are required to bill two claims when a surgical error is reported and a covered service is also being reported:

- One claim with covered service(s)/procedure(s) unrelated to the erroneous surgery(s) on a Type of Bill (TOB) 11X (with the exception of 110), and
- The other claim with the non-covered service(s)/procedure(s) related to the erroneous surgery(s) on a TOB 110 (no-pay claim)

**NOTE:** Both the covered and non-covered claim shall have a matching Statement Covers Period.

For discharges prior to October 1, 2009, the non-covered TOB 110 must indicate on the 837 institutional claim format, or in the Remarks field of the Form CMS1450 one of the applicable erroneous surgery(s) two-digit codes (entered exactly as specified below):

- For a wrong surgery on patient, enter the following: **MX**
- For a surgery on a wrong body part, enter the following: **MY**
- For a surgery on wrong patient, enter the following: **MZ**

For discharges on or after October 1, 2009, the non-covered TOB 110 must have one of the following diagnosis codes reported in diagnosis position 2-9, instead of billing the aforementioned two-digit codes in Remarks:

## **If ICD-9-CM Is Applicable**
- **E876.5** - Performance of wrong operation (procedure) on correct patient (existing code)
- **E876.6** - Performance of operation (procedure) on patient not scheduled for surgery
- **E876.7**- Performance of correct operation (procedure) on wrong side/body part

**NOTE**: The above codes shall not be reported in the External Cause of Injury (E-code) field.

## **If ICD-10-CM Is Applicable**
- Y65.51 Performance of wrong procedure (operation) on correct patient
- Y65.52 Performance of procedure (operation) on patient not scheduled for surgery
- Y65.53 Performance of correct procedure (operation) on wrong side of body parts Outpatient, Ambulatory Surgical Centers, and Practitioner Claims

Providers are required to append one of the following applicable HCPCS modifiers to all lines related to the erroneous surgery(s):

- PA: Surgery Wrong Body Part
- PB: Surgery Wrong Patient
- PC: Wrong Surgery on Patient All claims

Claim/Lines submitted with a surgical error will be denied/line-item denied using the following:

Medicare Summary Notice

**23.17** – Medicare won’t cover these services because they are not considered medically necessary.”

**23.17** – Medicare no cubrirá estos servicios porque no son considerados necesarios por razones médicas.

Claim Adjustment Reason Code

CARC 50 – These are non-covered services because this is not deemed a ‘medical necessity” by the payer.

Group Code

CO – Contractual Obligation Beneficiary Liability

Generally, beneficiary liability notices such an Advance Beneficiary Notice of Non-coverage (ABN) or a Hospital Issued Notice of Non-coverage (HINN) is appropriate when a provider is furnishing an item or service that the provider reasonably believes Medicare will not cover on the basis of §1862(a)(1). An ABN must include all of the elements described in Pub. 100-04, Claims Processing Manual (CPM), Ch. 30, §50.6.3, in order to be considered valid. For example, the ABN must specifically describe the item or service expected to be denied (e.g. a left leg amputation) and must include a cost estimate for the non-covered item or service.

Similarly, HINNs must specifically describe the item or service expected to be denied (e.g. a left leg amputation) and must include all of the elements described in the instructions found in the CPM Ch. 3,0 §200. Thus, a provider cannot shift financial liability for the non-covered services to the beneficiary, unless the ABN or the HINN satisfies all of the applicable requirements in the CPM Ch. 30, §50.6.3 and §200, respectively. Given these requirements, CMS cannot envision a scenario in which HINNs or ABNs could be validly delivered in these NCD cases. However, an ABN or a HINN could be validly delivered prior to furnishing services related to the follow-up care for the non-covered surgical error that would not be considered a related service to the non-covered surgical error.

## **(Rev. 1877, Issued: 12-18-09, Effective: 04-01-10, Implementation: 04-05-10)**

Claims for some services for beneficiaries with transgender, ambiguous genitalia, and hermaphrodite issues, may inadvertently be denied due to sex related edits unless these services are billed properly.

The National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC) has approved condition code 45 (Ambiguous Gender Category) as a result of the increasing number of claims received that are denied due to sex/diagnosis and sex/procedure edits. This claim level condition code should be used by institutional providers to identify these unique claims and alerts the fiscal intermediary that the gender/procedure or gender/diagnosis conflict is not an error allowing the sex related edits to be by-passed.

The KX modifier (Requirements specified in the medical policy have been met) is now a multipurpose informational modifier and will also be used identify services for transgender, ambiguous genitalia, and hermaphrodite beneficiaries in addition to its other existing uses. Physicians and non-physician practitioners should use modifier KX with procedure codes that are gender specific in the particular cases of transgender, ambiguous genitalia, and hermaphrodite beneficiaries. Therefore, if a gender/procedure or gender/diagnosis conflict edit occurs, the KX modifier alerts the MAC that it is not an error and will allow the claim to continue with normal processing.

Beginning April 5, 2010, for claims with dates of service on and after August 3, 2009, the Medicare Shared System will track the number of times a beneficiary receives pharmacogenomic testing for warfarin response. When a claim is received for pharmacogenomic testing for warfarin response, and the shared system has determined that the beneficiary has already received the test in his/her lifetime, it will generate a Medicare line-item denial and the Medicare contractor will provide the following messages to enforce the one-time limitation for the test:

Claim Adjustment Reason Code (CARC) 50 – These are non-covered services because this is not deemed a ‘medical necessity’ by the payer. This change to be effective April 1, 2010: These are non-covered services because this is not deemed a ‘medical necessity’ by the payer.

The Medicare shared system and the A/B MACs (B) will also ensure that pharmacogenomic testing for warfarin response is billed in accordance with clinical trial reporting requirements. In other words, the shared system and the A/B MACs (B) will return to provider/return as unprocessable lines for pharmacogenomic testing for warfarin response when said line is not billed with HCPCS modifier Q0 and ICD-10- CM diagnosis code if applicable, ICD-10-CM Z00.6 is not present as a secondary diagnosis. When the system or the A/B MAC (B) initiates the line- item return to provider or returns the claim as unprocessable, the Medicare contractor will respond with the following messages:

For a missing Q0 modifier:

CARC 4 - The procedure code is inconsistent with the modifier used or a required modifier is missing.

For a missing Z00.6 diagnosis code when a HCPCS Q0 modifier is reported with HCPCS G9143:

1. # **– Policy**
## **(Rev. 2105, Issued: 11-24-10, Effective: 03-23-10, Implementation: 07-06-10)**

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) received a request for national coverage of treatments for facial lipodystrophy syndrome (LDS) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected Medicare beneficiaries. Facial LDS is often characterized by a loss of fat that results in a facial abnormality such as severely sunken cheeks. This fat loss can arise as a complication of HIV and/or highly active antiretroviral therapy. Due to their appearance and stigma of the condition, patients with facial LDS may become depressed, socially isolated, and in some cases may stop their HIV treatments in an attempt to halt or reverse this complication.

Effective for claims with dates of service on and after March 23, 2010, dermal injections for facial LDS are only reasonable and necessary using dermal fillers approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this purpose, and then only in HIV-infected beneficiaries who manifest depression secondary to the physical stigmata of HIV treatment.

See Pub. 100-03, National Coverage Decision manual, section 250.5, for detailed policy information concerning treatment of LDS.

1. # <a name="_bookmark239"></a>**– Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs)**
## **(Rev.10837; Issued: 06-11-21; Effective: 12-01-20; Implementation: 07-27-21)**

Medicare may cover a Ventricular Assist Device (VAD). A VAD is surgically attached to one or both intact ventricles and is used to assist or augment the ability of a damaged or weakened native heart to pump blood. Improvement in the performance of the native heart may allow the device to be removed. Refer to the Internet Only Manual Publication 100-03, National Coverage Determination (NCD) Manual, section 20.9.1, for coverage criteria.

1. # <a name="_bookmark240"></a>**– Post-cardiotomy**
## **(Rev.10837; Issued: 06-11-21; Effective: 12-01-20; Implementation: 07-27-21)**

Post-cardiotomy is the period following open-heart surgery. VADs used for support of blood circulation post-cardiotomy are covered only if they have received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that purpose, and the VADs are used according to the FDA-approved labeling instructions.

1. # <a name="_bookmark241"></a>**–** VADs **for Short-term or Long-term Mechanical Circulatory Support**
## **(Rev.10837; Issued: 06-11-21; Effective: 12-01-20; Implementation: 07-27-21)**

Effective for claims with dates of service on or after December 1, 2020**,** Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are covered if they are FDA-approved for short-term (e.g., bridge-to- recovery and bridge-to-transplant) or long-term (e.g., destination therapy) mechanical circulatory support for heart failure patients who meet specific clinical criteria outlined in NCD 20.9.1.

1. # <a name="_bookmark242"></a>**– Other**
## **(Rev.10837; Issued: 06-11-21; Effective: 12-01-20; Implementation: 07-27-21)**

All other indications for the use of VADs not otherwise listed remain non-covered, except in the context of Category B investigational device exemption clinical trials (42 CFR 405) or as a routine cost in clinical trials defined under section 310.1 of the NCD Manual.

Coverage under section 1862(a) (1) (A) of the Social Security Act for VADs in these situations will be made by local Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) within their respective jurisdictions.

1. # **– Replacement Accessories and Supplies for External VADs or Any VAD**
## **(Rev.10837; Issued: 06-11-21; Effective: 12-01-20; Implementation: 07-27-21)**

Effective April 1, 2013, claims for replacement of accessories and supplies for VADs implanted in patients who were not eligible for coverage under Medicare Part A or had other insurance that paid for the device and hospital stay at the time that the device was implanted, but are now eligible for coverage of the replacement supplies and accessories under Part B, should be submitted using HCPCS code Q0509. Those claims will be manually reviewed.

In rare instances it may be appropriate to pay for replacement of supplies and accessories for external VADs used by patient who are discharged from the hospital. In addition, in some rare instances, it may be necessary for a patient to have an emergency back-up controller for an external VAD. Coverage of these items is at the discretion of the contractor. Claims for replacement of supplies and accessories used with an external VAD that are furnished by suppliers should be billed to the Part B MACs. Claims for replacement of supplies and accessories used with an external VAD that are furnished by hospitals and other providers should be billed to the Part AMACs. Effective April 1, 2013, these items should be billed using code Q0507 so that the claims can be manually reviewed.

Claims for replacement supplies or accessories used with VADs that do not have specific HCPCS codes and do not meet the criteria of codes Q0507 and Q0509 should be billed using code Q0508.

330. # <a name="_bookmark243"></a>**– Percutaneous Image-guided Lumbar Decompression (PILD) for Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS)**
## **(Rev. 2959, Issued: 05-16-14, Effective: 01-09-14, Implementation: 10-06-14)**

PILD is a posterior decompression of the lumbar spine performed under indirect image guidance without any direct visualization of the surgical area. This is a procedure proposed as a treatment for symptomatic LSS unresponsive to conservative therapy. This procedure is generally described as a non-invasive procedure using specially designed instruments to percutaneously remove a portion of the lamina and debulk the ligamentum flavum. The procedure is performed under x-ray guidance (e.g., fluoroscopic, CT) with the assistance of contrast media to identify and monitor the compressed area via epiduragram. For complete Medical coverage guidelines, see National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Manual (Pub 100-03) §150.13.

1. # <a name="_bookmark244"></a>**– Claims Processing Requirements for Percutaneous Image-guided Lumbar Decompression (PILD) for Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS) on Professional Claims**
## **(Rev. 3811, Issued: 07-25-17, Effective: 12-07-16, Implementation: 06-27-17)**

For claims with dates of service on or after January 9, 2014, PILD (procedure code 0275T) is a covered service when billed as part of a clinical trial approved by CMS. The description for CPT 0275T is “Percutaneous laminotomy/laminectomy (intralaminar approach) for decompression of neural elements, (with or without ligamentous resection, discectomy, facetectomy and/or foraminotomy”, any method, under indirect image guidance (e.g., fluoroscopic, CT), with or without the use of an endoscope, single or multiple levels, unilateral or bilateral; lumbar”.

For claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2015, PILD (procedure code G0276) is a covered service when billed as part of a clinical trial approved by CMS. HCPCS G0276 is “Blinded procedure for lumbar stenosis, percutaneous image-guided lumbar decompression (PILD), or placebo control, performed in an approved coverage with evidence development (CED) clinical trial”.

Effective for dates of service on or after December 7, 2016, Medicare will cover PILD under CED for beneficiaries with LSS who are enrolled in a CMS-approved prospective longitudinal study for PILD procedures using a FDA- approved/cleared device that completed a CMS-approved randomized, controlled clinical trial (RCT) that met the criteria listed in the January 2014 NCD (see CR 8757, transmittal # 2959, dated May 16, 2014).

The claim may only contain one of these procedure codes, not both. To use G0276, the procedure must be performed in an approved CED clinical trial that is randomized, blinded, and contains a placebo control arm of the trial. CMS will cover procedure code 0275T for PILD only when the procedure is performed within any other CED approved clinical trial. Regardless of the type of CED approved clinical trial (e.g. G0276 vs 0275T), PILD is only covered when billed for the ICD-9 diagnosis of 724.01-724.03 or the ICD-10 diagnosis of M48.05-M48.07, when billed in places of service 22 (Outpatient) or 24 (Ambulatory Surgical Center), when billed along with V70.7 (ICD-9) or Z00.6 (ICD-10) in either the primary/secondary positions, and when billed with modifier Q0.

Additionally, per Transmittal 2805 (Change Request 8401), issued October 30, 2013, all claims for clinical trials must contain the 8 digit clinical trial identifier number.

The following message(s) shall be used to notify providers of return situations that may occur:

## **(Rev. 10985; Issued:09-08-21, Effective:01-19-21; Implementation:10-08-21)**

Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair (TEER) of the mitral valve (previously named Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair (TMVR)) is used in the treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR). TEER approximates the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets by grasping them with a clipping device in an approach similar to a treatment developed in cardiac surgery called the Alfieri stitch.

The most recent reconsideration of NCD 20.33 (TEER for Mitral Valve Regurgitation (previously named TMVR)) is effective for claims with dates of service on and after January 19, 2021. It expands coverage of mitral valve TEER procedures for the treatment of functional MR and maintains coverage of TEER for the treatment of degenerative MR, through coverage with evidence development (CED) and with mandatory registry participation. It also makes changes to the criteria for the heart team and hospital, and to the registry questions/criteria and the trial requirements and outcomes. For more detailed information see Pub. 100-03, Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Manual, Chapter 1, Section 20.33.

For services furnished between August 7, 2014 and January 19, 2021, the CMS covered TMVR for MR when furnished under CED when the treatment was furnished for an FDA-approved indication with an FDA-approved device as follows:

(1) Treatment of significant, symptomatic, degenerative MR when furnished according to an FDA-approved indication and all CMS coverage criteria are met, and, (2) TMVR for MR uses not expressly listed as FDA-approved indications but only within the context of an FDA-approved, randomized clinical trial that meets all CMS coverage criteria. TMVR was non-covered outside CED or for non-MR indications.

U.S. hospital where they are necessary to prevent the death or serious impairment of the health of the individual. Because of the threat to the life or health of the individual, the use of the most accessible hospital equipped to furnish such services is necessary. Items and services furnished in a domestic nonparticipating hospital may be reimbursed if the following apply:

The hospital meets the definition of an emergency hospital. (See §350.3.) The services meet the definition of emergency services. (See §350.2.)

The hospital is substantially more accessible from the site of the emergency than is the nearest participating hospital. (See §350.4.)

1. ## **Services Received by Medicare Beneficiaries outside the United States**

Items and services furnished outside the United States and certain services rendered on board a ship are excluded from coverage except for the following services:

Emergency inpatient hospital services where the emergency occurred:

0. While the beneficiary was physically present in the United States; or
0. In Canada while the beneficiary was traveling without reasonable delay and by the most direct route between Alaska and another State.

Emergency or nonemergency inpatient hospital services furnished by a hospital located outside the United States, if the hospital was closer to, or substantially more accessible from, the beneficiary’s United States residence than the nearest participating United States hospital that was adequately equipped to deal with, and available to provide treatment for the illness or injury.

Physician and ambulance services furnished in connection with a covered foreign hospitalization. Program payment may not be made for any other Part B medical and other health services, including outpatient services furnished outside the United States.

Services rendered on board a ship in a United States port, or within 6 hours of when the ship arrived at, or departed from, a United States port, are considered to have been furnished in United States territorial waters. Services not furnished in a United States port, or within 6 hours of when the ship arrived at, or departed from, a United States port, are considered to have been furnished outside United States territorial waters, even if the ship is of United States registry.

The term “United States” means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and, for purposes of services rendered on a ship, includes the territorial waters adjoining the land areas of the United States.

A hospital that is not physically situated in one of the above jurisdictions is considered to be outside the United States, even if it is owned or operated by the United States Government.

1. ## **Ship Physician’s Office is in the United States.**

When the physician’s office is inside of the United States, the contractor designated to process the shipboard claim is determined by the beneficiary’s residence.

1. ## **Ship Physician’s Office is Outside of the United States.**

When the physician’s office is outside of the United States, the contractor designated to process the shipboard claim is determined by the beneficiary’s residence.

## **MSN message 16.240 (English)**

Services provided aboard a ship are covered only when the ship is in United States waters. In addition, the service must be provided by a doctor licensed to practice in the United States.

## **MSN message 16.240 (Spanish)**

Servicios proporcionados abordo de un barco son cubiertos solamente cuando el barco está en aguas territoriales de los Estados Unidos. Además, el servicio debe ser proporcionado por un médico con licencia para practicar en los Estados Unidos.

Payment may not be made for any item provided or delivered to the beneficiary outside the United States, even though the beneficiary may have contracted to purchase the item while he or she was within the United States or purchased the item from an American firm.

Under the Railroad Retirement Act, payment is made to qualified Railroad Retirement beneficiaries (QRRBs) by the RRB for covered hospital services furnished in Canadian hospitals as well as in the U.S. Physician and ambulance services are not covered by the Railroad Retirement Act; however, under an agreement between CMS and RRB, if the QRRB claims payment for Part B services in connection with Canadian hospitalization, RRB processes the Part B claim. In such cases the RRB determines:

Whether the requirements are met for the inpatient services; and

Whether the physician and/or ambulance services were furnished in connection with the services.

Services for an individual who has elected religious nonmedical health care status may be covered if the above requirements are met but this revokes the religious nonmedical health care institution election.

1. # <a name="_bookmark253"></a>**- Establishing an Emergency**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

Claims for emergency services must be accompanied by a physician's statement describing the nature of the emergency and stating that the services were necessary to prevent the death, or the serious impairment of, the beneficiary. A

statement that an emergency existed is not sufficient. In addition, when inpatient services are involved, the statement must include the date when, in the physicians' judgment, the emergency ceased.

The finding of whether the patient's condition required emergency diagnosis or treatment is ordinarily based upon the physician's evaluation of the patient's condition immediately upon the beneficiary's arrival at the hospital.

However, the emergency nature of the situation may have been assessed by a physician who attended the patient where the incident resulting in hospitalization occurred (for example, a heart attack or an automobile accident). In these cases, the attending physician who ordered the hospitalization may substantiate the claim that emergency hospitalization was necessary.

Most emergencies are of relatively short duration so that only one bill is submitted. Generally, only one physician's statement is necessary. However, in the rare situation where an emergency continued over an extended period, subsequent requests for payment must be accompanied by a physician's statement containing sufficient information to indicate clearly that the emergency situation still existed. A statement that the emergency continued to exist is not acceptable.

Additional information to support a finding that the services were emergency services from the physician, the hospital, and others (e.g., the police department at the scene of an accident) may be requested.

Medical necessity can be documented by the physician on a CMS-l77l, Attending Physician's Statement and Documentation of Medicare Emergency or by the beneficiary's medical records. The CMS-1771 can be obtained from:

Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Forms Management Section

7500 Security Blvd.

Baltimore, MD 21244-1850

Or, the form can be downloaded from <http://cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms-List.html>

1. # <a name="_bookmark254"></a>**- Qualifications of an Emergency Services Hospital**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

An emergency services hospital is a nonparticipating hospital that meets the requirements of the law's definition of a "hospital" relating to full-time nursing services and licensure under State or applicable local law. (A federal hospital need not be licensed under state or local licensing laws to meet this definition.) In addition, the hospital must be primarily engaged in providing, under the supervision of doctors of medicine or osteopathy, services of the type described in defining the term hospital.

The hospital must not be primarily engaged in providing skilled nursing care and related services for patients who require medical or nursing care. Psychiatric hospitals can qualify as emergency hospitals.

1. # <a name="_bookmark255"></a>**- Coverage Requirements for Emergency Hospital Services Furnished Outside of the United States**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

The following requirements must be met for payment to be made for emergency services received by Medicare beneficiaries in foreign hospitals:

- The hospital must meet the definition of an emergency hospital and be licensed or approved by the appropriate agency of the country in which it is located.

- The services meet the criteria of emergency services.

The foreign hospital must be closer to or substantially more accessible from the site of the emergency than the nearest

U.S. hospital that was adequately equipped and available to treat the illness or injury.

1. Emergency Occurred in the U.S. (See §350.1.B for definition of the U.S.)

If the individual was physically present in the U.S. at the time the emergency occurred, the individual's reason for departure from the U.S. must have been specifically to obtain treatment at the foreign hospital. Services are not covered where the person's departure from the U.S. is part of a trip abroad and the foreign hospital is more accessible simply because the individual was in the process of travel. For example, the airplane on which the individual was traveling could not readily return to permit the person's removal.

1. Emergency Occurred in Canada

If the emergency occurred in Canada, the beneficiary must have been traveling, without unreasonable delay, by the most direct route between Alaska and another state. Benefits are not payable if the emergency occurred while a beneficiary was vacationing. The requirement of travel without unreasonable delay by the most direct route will be considered met if the emergency occurred while the beneficiary was enroute between Alaska and another state by the shortest practicable route, or while making a necessary stopover in connection with such travel.

**NOTE:** An emergency occurring within the Canadian inland waterway between the States of Washington and Alaska is considered to have occurred in Canada.

Ordinarily, the "shortest practicable route" is the one that results in the least amount of travel in Canada, consistent with the mode of travel used between the point of entry into Canada and the intended point of departure. The amount of travel in the U.S., prior to entering Canada is not pertinent. A route involving greater travel within Canada may be considered the "shortest practicable route" if the additional travel resulted in a saving of time or was necessary because of such factors as:

0. Road or weather conditions;

0. The age of the traveler;

0. Health, or physical condition of the traveler;

0. The need to make suitable travel arrangements; or

0. The need to obtain acceptable accommodations.

However, the individual would be considered to have deviated from the "shortest practicable route" if the detour was unrelated to the purpose of reaching their destination (e.g., for the principal purpose of sightseeing or vacationing).

The term "necessary stopover" means a routine stopover for rest, food, or servicing of the vehicle, and a non-routine stopover (even though of significant duration) caused by such factors as unsuitable road or weather conditions, the age, health, or physical condition of the traveler, the need to make suitable travel arrangements, or to obtain acceptable accommodations.

1. # <a name="_bookmark256"></a>**- Services Furnished in a Foreign Hospital Nearest to Beneficiary's U.S. Residence**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

Coverage is provided for inpatient hospital services furnished in a foreign hospital that is closer to, or substantially more accessible from, the beneficiary's U.S. residence than the nearest available participating U.S. hospital that is adequately equipped to deal with the illness or injury, whether or not an emergency existed and without regard to where the illness or injury occurred.

"Residence" means the beneficiary's fixed and permanent home to which they intend to return whenever they are away or a dwelling where the beneficiary periodically spends some time (e.g., a summer home).

The foreign hospital must meet accreditation requirements equivalent to Joint Commission standards. For example, the Canadian Council on Hospital Accreditation (CCHA) has equivalent requirements. Thus, Canadian hospitals accredited by the CCHA meet the qualifying requirements. In the case of Mexican hospitals, the Dallas or San Francisco RO makes the determination, depending upon the hospital's location. Claims for services provided in countries other than Canada or Mexico should be sent to the MAC that is responsible for the state or territory where the emergency arose. In other words, the foreign claim would be processed similarly to how claims are processed in the state or territory where the emergency arose.

See §350.11.4 below for discussion of accessibility criteria.

Some claims for services furnished in a foreign hospital nearest to the beneficiary's U.S. residence will not be "emergency." In these nonemergency situations, it may be necessary to deny payment in whole or part, (even though it has been approved with regard to accessibility) because the services are not medically reasonable and necessary or involve custodial care (i.e., exclusions under §§1862(a)(1) and (9)). However, in the case of denials under the medical necessity and custodial care exclusions, the MAC applies the limitation on liability considerations under [§1879](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of the Act before issuing the denial notice.

The MAC examines claims involving medical necessity or custodial care denials to determine if there is any evidence that the beneficiary (or the person acting on behalf of the beneficiary) was aware that the beneficiary did not require, or no longer required, a covered level of care. The foreign hospital, since it is not participating, is not under any obligation to furnish a written notice of noncoverage to a beneficiary in order to protect itself from being held liable under the

§1879 waiver of liability provision. However, there may be instances where the medical records of the denied foreign claim show that the beneficiary was advised that the beneficiary did not require, or no longer required, Medicare covered services, (e.g., written notice of noncoverage from the hospital's staff or a prior CMS denial notice). It will probably be rare where a finding is made that the beneficiary had knowledge of noncoverage, so that, generally, payments are made under the waiver of liability provision. The MAC uses appropriate Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) and Remittance Advice denial messages for determinations involving the limitation on liability provision. For additional information regarding the application of the §1879 liability provisions, see Pub 100-04, chapter 30.

1. # <a name="_bookmark257"></a>**– Coverage of Physician and Ambulance Services Furnished Outside U.S.**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

Payment is made for necessary physician and ambulance services that meet the other coverage requirements of the Medicare program, and are furnished in connection with a covered foreign hospitalization.

1. Coverage of Physician and Ambulance Services Furnished Outside the U.S.

Where inpatient services in a foreign hospital are covered, payment may also be made for: Physicians’ services furnished to the beneficiary while he/she is an inpatient,

Physicians’ services furnished to the beneficiary outside the hospital on the day of his/her admission as an inpatient, provided the services were for the same condition for which the beneficiary was hospitalized (including the services of a physician who furnishes emergency services in Canadian waters on the day the patient is admitted to a Canadian hospital for a covered emergency stay) and,

Ambulance services, where necessary, for the trip to the hospital in conjunction with the beneficiary’s admission as an inpatient. Return trips from a foreign hospital are not covered.

In cases involving foreign ambulance services, the general requirements in chapter 15 are also applicable, subject to the following special rules:

If the foreign hospitalization was determined to be covered on the basis of emergency services, the medical necessity requirements outlined in chapter 15 are considered met.

The definition of “physician,” for purposes of coverage of services furnished outside the U.S., is expanded to include a foreign practitioner, provided the practitioner is legally licensed to practice in the country in which the services are furnished.

Only the beneficiary may file for Part B benefits. The assignment method may not be used. However, where the beneficiary is deceased, the rule for settling Part B underpayments is applicable, i.e., payment may be made to the foreign physician or ambulance company on the basis of an unpaid bill, provided the physician or ambulance company accepts the MACs reasonable charge determination as the full charge.

The regular deductible and coinsurance requirements apply to physician and ambulance services.

1. # <a name="_bookmark258"></a>**- Claims for Services Furnished in Canada to Qualified Railroad Retirement Beneficiaries**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

All claims for hospital and/or related physician or ambulance services furnished in Canada to qualified railroad retirement beneficiaries (QRRB’s) are forwarded first to the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB). Under the Railroad Retirement Act, payment is made by the RRB to Qualified Railroad Retirement Beneficiaries (QRRB) for covered hospital services furnished in Canadian hospitals as well as in the U.S. The Railroad Retirement Act does not cover physician and ambulance services; however, under an agreement between CMS and RRB, if the QRRB claims payment for Part B services in connection with Canadian hospitalization, RRB processes the Part B claim. In such cases the RRB determines:

- Whether the requirements in §§350.1.B and 350.6 are met in regard to the inpatient services; and
- Whether the requirements in§350.6.A are met in regard to the physician and/or ambulance services were furnished in connection with the services

If either is not met, RRB denies the claim and notifies the beneficiary. If met, RRB refers the claim to the RRB MAC, Palmetto GBA, to determine if the coverage criteria for physician and/or ambulance services are met.

The hospital must forward all claims for services furnished QRRBs in Canada to:

Retirement Medicare Section

U.S. Railroad Retirement Board 844 North Rush Street Chicago, IL 60611-2092

If a QRRB is a resident of Canada, Medicare payments are reduced by the amount of payment made for the same services by the Canadian Provincial Health Insurance Plan.

1. Claims for services furnished in other foreign countries

The RRB does not pay for health care services furnished in Mexico or any foreign countries other than Canada.

All claims for inpatient hospital services and/or related physician or ambulance services furnished in Mexico to QRRB’s should be forwarded directly to the Railroad Retirement Board. If the Railroad Retirement Board determines that the requirements in §350.6.A are not met, the Railroad Retirement Board will deny the claim and send notice to the beneficiary. If the requirements in §350.6.A or B are met, the Railroad Retirement Board will hold any potentially allowable Part B claim until an MAC determination regarding the coverage of Part A services has been made. When the information regarding Part A coverage is available, the Railroad Retirement Board will send the Part B claim, together with pertinent information regarding the Part A determination, to Palmetto Government Benefits for consideration of whether the other requirements for Part B coverage are met, and further processing.

1. # <a name="_bookmark259"></a>**- Claims from Hospital-Leased Laboratories Not Meeting Conditions of Participation**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

Services furnished by a laboratory that does not meet the hospital laboratory conditions of participation and is operated under a lease arrangement in a domestic emergency hospital are covered only if they are emergency inpatient services reimbursable under Part A.

A MAC may send a claim from such a laboratory and identify it as an "Emergency Lead." The MAC checks its files to see if a claim for emergency services was filed and, if so, determines whether the laboratory services were furnished during the period of emergency. If the emergency claim was forwarded to the appropriate MAC for processing, it enters the date received on the laboratory claim.

If no emergency claim was filed, or laboratory services were not furnished in the period covered by the emergency claim, the MAC develops the claim as a possible emergency. It includes the laboratory claim with any subsequent claim.

If no emergency is alleged, the MAC records on the claim that no emergency existed and disallows it.

1. # <a name="_bookmark260"></a>**- Nonemergency Part B Medical and Other Health Services**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

1. Coverage

Nonemergency services to Medicare beneficiaries may be paid for if the coverage requirements for the services are met, and are not covered as Part A emergency inpatient services.

Program payment may be made for the following Part B medical and other health services furnished by a U.S. nonparticipating hospital on a nonemergency basis:

0. Diagnostic x-ray tests, diagnostic laboratory tests and other diagnostic tests. (The hospital must meet the applicable conditions of participation for the services.)

0. X-ray, radium, and radioactive isotope therapy, including materials and services of technicians. (The hospital must meet the applicable conditions of participation for these services.)

0. Services of residents and interns, nurses, therapists, etc., which are directly related to the provision of x-ray or laboratory or other diagnostic tests, or the provisions of x-ray or radium therapy.

0. Prosthetic devices (other than dental) which replace all or part of an internal body organ (including contiguous tissue) or replace all or part of the functions of a permanently inoperative or malfunctioning internal body organ, including replacement of such devices.

0. Leg, arm, back, and neck braces, trusses and artificial legs, arms, and eyes, including replacement, if required, because of a change in the patient's physical condition.

1. Distinction Between Emergency and Nonemergency Medical and Other Health Services

Emergency coverage, particularly Part B emergency outpatient coverage, is broader than the nonemergency Part B Medical and Other Health Services coverage provisions. When the emergency requirements are met, program payment may be made to the hospital for the full range of outpatient hospital services. In addition to the nonemergency coverage list, emergency coverage includes hospital services (including drugs and biologicals - blood is a biological - which cannot be self-administered), "incident to physicians' services rendered to outpatients," and outpatient physical therapy and speech-language pathology. The latter two services are not covered under the nonemergency provisions. Payment for "incident to" services can be only under the emergency rather than the nonemergency provisions.

Whether Part B payment is made under the emergency or nonemergency provisions, it may be made for diagnostic laboratory tests furnished by an emergency hospital only if the hospital meets the conditions of participation relating to hospital laboratories. It may be made only for radiology services furnished by an emergency hospital if the hospital meets the conditions of participation relating to radiology departments. Part B payment may be made for diagnostic laboratory tests furnished by a nonparticipating hospital which is not an emergency hospital only if the hospital laboratory meets the conditions of coverage of independent laboratories and for radiology services furnished by it, only if it meets the conditions of participation relating to radiology departments.

1. Claims Processing

The hospital enters the annotation "nonemergency-hospital accepts assignment" in Remarks of the Form CMS-1450. If it is determined that some or all of the services are not covered under the nonemergency provisions, the claim is returned to it (if hospital-filed) or to the beneficiary (if patient-filed) to determine whether the services might be covered as emergency services.

1. # <a name="_bookmark261"></a>**- Elections to Bill for Services Rendered By Nonparticipating Hospitals**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

1. Nonparticipating U.S. Hospitals

As a nonparticipating U.S. hospital meeting emergency requirements, the hospital has the option to bill the program during a calendar year by filing an election with its MAC. If it files an election, it should submit claims for the following services furnished all Medicare beneficiaries throughout the year:

0. Emergency inpatient services; and

0. Emergency outpatient services.

In addition, the hospital may not bill any beneficiary beyond deductibles, coinsurance, and noncovered services in that calendar year. It must agree to refund any monies incorrectly collected. It may not file an election for the calendar year if it has already charged any beneficiary for covered services furnished in that year.

If the hospital does not file a billing election, the beneficiary can file a claim. The beneficiary may request information from the hospital or the MAC as appropriate.

During November of each year, the MAC will send the non-participating hospital a letter (see [§360.3.1](#_bookmark276)). Also, during November of each year, the MAC will send a letter to each domestic hospital, giving it an opportunity to elect to bill Medicare if it has not been doing so ([§360.3.2](#_bookmark277)).

If during the year the hospital requests to bill the program, its MAC will send the model letter in [§360.3.3.](#_bookmark278)

1. Billing for Services Furnished Prior to Certification

The following rules apply if a bill is submitted for services rendered before and after a hospital's certification (participation) date:

0. PPS hospitals are paid the DRG, if the date of discharge is after the certification date.

0. Other hospitals are paid for services rendered after the certification date. However, the hospital must include services before certification date on its cost report.

It should annotate in the upper right hand corner of the claim "Emergency Conversion."

1. Foreign Hospitals

Foreign hospitals may submit a statement to the appropriate MAC stating that they will bill for all claims. If they do not, the beneficiary may claim the payment. When the MAC is aware that a hospital is willing to bill the program for all covered services, it solicits the hospital's agreement to:

0. Bill for all covered services for the calendar year (except for deductible and coinsurance amounts);

0. Not bill the beneficiary for any amounts other than for deductible and coinsurance and charges for noncovered services; and

0. Refund to the beneficiary any monies incorrectly collected.

A hospital may not file an election for a calendar year if it has charged any beneficiary for covered services during that year.

1. Submitting Claims

The beneficiary or the hospital that has elected to bill the program may submit emergency claims for payment to the appropriate MAC for evaluation of accessibility or emergency factors.

The hospital completes the claim (Form CMS-1450 or electronic equivalent) according to billing instructions in chapter

25\. It enters "hospital filed emergency admission" in Item 94 "Remarks." It sends the completed bill and the necessary emergency documentation (Form CMS-1771, Attending Physicians Statement and Documentation of Medicare Emergency) or medical records to substantiate the emergency to the appropriate MAC.

**NOTE:** See [§360.2,](#_bookmark274) "Designated Contractors."

If the hospital submits a claim but has not filed an election to bill the program, the MAC will contact the hospital to determine if it is qualified and wish to bill the program. If it declines, the claim will be denied. A claim will be solicited from the beneficiary.

If the hospital has filed a billing election and the beneficiary files a claim, the beneficiary's claim is denied and the MAC contacts the hospital regarding the claim.

1. # <a name="_bookmark262"></a>**- Processing Claims**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

All claims are subject to development to determine whether the Medicare secondary payer provisions apply. (See Pub. 100-05, Medicare Secondary Payer Manual.)

1. Nonparticipating Hospitals

The processing MAC is responsible for making accessibility and medical emergency determinations for physician and ambulance services.

1. Claims Subject to Technical Denials

The following claims are subject to technical denial:

0. Foreign nonemergency services claims if:

0. The residence requirement is not met. (See [§350.5](#_bookmark256).)

0. The hospital rendering the service does not meet Joint Commission or equivalent accreditation requirements set by a hospital approval program of the country in which it is located.

0. The accessibility requirements are not met. (See §350.11.4.)

0. Canadian travel claims when the requirements in [§350.4](#_bookmark255) are not met.

0. Emergency services claims for which the hospital does not meet the definition of an emergency hospital.

0. Claims for which the query response shows the beneficiary is not entitled to benefits.

0. Any foreign claim when Part A benefits are exhausted and Part B physician or ambulance claims are not involved.

1. Either the Accessibility or Medical Emergency Requirements are Not Met Claim is denied but retained in case of an appeal by the beneficiary.

**NOTE:** Even though Part A or Part B emergency services furnished by U.S. hospitals are denied, Part B payment may be possible for Medical and Other Health Services specified in Pub. 100-02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 6. Claim is retained in case of an appeal by the beneficiary.

1. Emergency Services Partially Denied

When the medical emergency is approved but not for the entire period, the claim is processed and payment made for the covered period.

1. Foreign Part B Physician and Ambulance Claims

The hospital must attach any Part B claim for foreign physician and ambulance services to the corresponding Part A claim and forward to the MAC.

If the MAC determines that the inpatient services were covered, it sends the physician and/or independent ambulance claim to the designated MAC for processing and payment. (See §350.6.)

If the Part A claim is denied on the basis of accessibility of medical emergency, the MAC denies the Part B claim, and sends a MSN to the beneficiary. It retains copies in case of an appeal by the beneficiary.

**NOTE:** Even though Part A benefits are totally or partially exhausted, payment may be made by the MAC for physician and independent ambulance services furnished if all coverage requirements are met.

If a Part A claim was partially denied because the emergency terminated, the MAC makes a decision on the claim and any provider-based ambulance claim. It sends copies to the appropriate MAC for processing.

1. # <a name="_bookmark263"></a>**- Contractors Designated to Process Foreign Claims**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

Per contractor Statement of Work (SOW) all contractors are designated to process claims for physicians’ and ambulance services furnished in connection with a covered foreign hospital stay for their beneficiaries who reside in the states/areas for which they process claims.

All contractors are designated to determine whether the requirements in §350.6 are met for claims for inpatient services based upon the geographic location of the foreign hospitals furnishing the services.

All contractors are designated to process these claims if there is evidence that the Part B services were furnished in connection with covered foreign inpatient hospital services. If there is no evidence, the Contractor must send a front-end rejection notice in accordance with §350.11.2.

1. # <a name="_bookmark264"></a>**- Contractor Processing Guidelines**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

Per contractor Statement of Work (SOW) all contractors are responsible for processing foreign, emergency and shipboard claims for their beneficiaries who reside in the states/areas for which they process claims.

The A/B MAC determines whether the requirements in §350.6.A are met. If these requirements are not met, the A/B MAC denies the Part A claim and related Part B claim and notifies the beneficiary. Where the A/B MAC determines that the requirements in §350.6.A are met, the A/B MAC determines whether other applicable Part A coverage requirements are met. If the A/B MAC disallows the Part A claim, it denies the related Part B claim and notifies the beneficiary. However, the A/B MAC will not be involved in the processing of foreign claims if, for any reason, the related Part A claim is denied.

If the claim does not show that the beneficiary was hospitalized, the A/B MAC sends the beneficiary a front-end rejection notice. In filling out the Notification of Medicare Determination, the A/B MACs should check “other” and include the following explanation: “Foreign physician or ambulance services are not covered unless they were furnished in connection with a covered inpatient stay.”

1. # <a name="_bookmark265"></a>**- Medicare Approved Charges for Services Rendered in Canada or Mexico**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

For Canadian services, the Medicare approved charge will be the lower of:

1. The allowed amount for the same service in the U.S. locality closest to where the service was furnished (as determined by the designated MAC), or

1. The Canadian Provincial fee.

Therefore, the designated MAC must obtain the most recent schedule of fees published by the appropriate Canadian Province. Most of the designated MACs deal with only one Provincial schedule.

For Mexican services, the maximum charge is the Medicare allowed amount for the same service in the locality closest to where the service was furnished (as determined by the designated MAC).

1. # <a name="_bookmark266"></a>**- Accessibility Criteria**
## **(Rev. 4111, Issued: 08-10-18, Effective: 9-11-18, Implementation: 9-11-18)**

1. Emergency Claims

The MAC uses the same criteria in domestic and foreign emergency claims. This includes services in a foreign religious non-medical health care institution and Canadian Travel claims. (See [§350.4](#_bookmark255) and §350.9.)

Emergency determinations take into account such matters as relative distances of a participating hospital, and road conditions. The MAC considers whether the nature of the emergency required immediate transportation to the nearest available hospital (i.e., the nonparticipating hospital) or, without hazard to the patient, would have permitted the additional transportation time to take the patient to a more distant participating hospital in the same general area.

The MAC does not consider in its determination such factors involving selection of a hospital which reflect the personal preferences of the individual or physician, (e.g., physician does not have staff privileges at the participating hospital) nearness to beneficiary's residence, presence of previous medical records at the nonparticipating hospital, cost, or type of accommodations available.

The following sections discuss documentation of the accessibility requirement and provide guidelines for making a determination where the participating hospital is:

0. Closer to the site of the emergency than is the admitting nonparticipating hospital;

0. Fifteen or fewer miles farther from the site of the emergency than is the nonparticipating hospital; or

0. Sixteen or more miles farther from the site of the emergency than is the admitting nonparticipating hospital.

In urban and suburban areas, where both participating and nonparticipating hospitals are similarly available, it is presumed, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, that the services could have been provided in the participating hospital.

1. Participating Hospital Closer to Site of Emergency

If there is an adequately equipped participating hospital with available beds closer to the site of the emergency than the nonparticipating hospital, accessibility is not met. Claim is denied unless extenuating circumstances were present that necessitated admission to the nonparticipating hospital, e.g., because of road or traffic conditions additional travel time would have been needed.

1. Participating Hospital 15 or Fewer Miles Farther From the Location of the Emergency Than the Admitting Nonparticipating Hospital

In this situation the accessibility is provisionally not met. The claim is reviewed to determine if the nature of the emergency required the immediate transportation to the nonparticipating hospital. If the review indicates that the nature of the emergency would have allowed the additional transportation time needed to take the patient to the participating hospital without undue hazard, the accessibility requirement is not met. The claim is denied.

1. Participating Hospital More than 15 Miles Farther From the Location of the Emergency Than the Admitting Nonparticipating Hospital

The accessibility requirement is deemed met.

1. Foreign Nonemergency Claims

The following presumptions are applied to the relative accessibility of the nearest participating U.S. and foreign hospitals.

1. Admitting Foreign Hospital is Closer to the Beneficiary's Residence Than the Nearest Participating U.S. Hospital The accessibility requirement is met.
1. Admitting Foreign Hospital is Farther From the Beneficiary's Residence Than the Nearest Participating U.S. Hospital

The accessibility requirement is not met unless evidence establishes the practical necessity for the beneficiary's admission. This requirement is met if the use of a closer participating U.S. hospital was impractical, e.g., non- availability of beds, needed equipment or personnel, or transportation not available.

In determining whether a foreign hospital is more accessible than a participating hospital, the MAC does not consider the personal preference of the beneficiary, physician, or others in the selection of a hospital, the type of accommodations available, or the nonavailability of staff privileges to the attending physician.

1. # <a name="_bookmark267"></a>**- Medical Necessity**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

1. Emergency Services

Reimbursement for emergency inpatient hospital services is permitted only for those periods during which the patient's state of injury or disease is such that a health or life-endangering emergency existed and continued to exist, requiring immediate care that could be provided only in a hospital. The allegation that an emergency existed must be substantiated by sufficient medical information from the physician or hospital. If the physician's statement does not provide it, or is not supplemented by adequate clinical corroboration of this allegation, it does not constitute sufficient evidence.

Death of the patient does not necessarily establish the existence of a medical emergency, since in some chronic, terminal illnesses, time is available to plan admission to a participating hospital. The lack of adequate care at home or lack of

transportation to a participating hospital does not constitute a reason for emergency hospital admission, without an immediate threat to the life and health of the patient. Since the existence of medical necessity for emergency services is based upon the physician's assessment of the patient prior to admission, serious medical conditions developing after a non-emergency admission are not "emergencies" under the emergency services provisions of the Act.

The emergency ceases when it becomes safe, from a medical standpoint, to move the individual to a participating hospital, another institution, or to discharge the individual.

1. Criteria

Since the decision that a medical emergency existed can be a matter of subjective medical judgment involving the entire gamut of disease and accident situations, it is impossible to provide arbitrary guidelines.

1. Diagnosis is Considered "Usually an Emergency"

An emergency condition is an unanticipated deterioration of a beneficiary's health which requires the immediate provision of inpatient hospital services because the patient's chances of survival, or regaining prior health status, depends upon the speed with which medical or surgical procedures are, or can be, applied. While many diagnoses (e.g., myocardial infarction, acute appendicitis) are normally considered emergencies, the hospital must check medical documentation for internal consistencies (e.g., signs and symptoms upon admission, notations concerning changes in a preexisting condition, results of diagnostic tests).

EXAMPLE: If the diagnosis is given as "coronary," the physician's statement is "coronary," without further explanatory remarks, and the statement of services rendered gives no indication that an electrocardiogram was taken, or that the patient required intensive care, etc., further information is required. On the other hand, if the diagnosis is one that ordinarily indicates a medical and/or surgical emergency, and the treatment, diagnostic procedures, and period of hospitalization are consistent with the diagnosis, further documentation may be unnecessary. An example is: admitting diagnosis - appendicitis; discharge diagnosis - appendicitis; surgical procedures - appendectomy; period of inpatient stay

\- 7 days.

1. Patient Dies During Hospitalization

If an emergency existed at the time of admission and the patient subsequently expires, the claim is allowed for emergency services if the period of coverage is reasonable. However, death of the patient is not prima facie evidence that an emergency existed; e.g., death can occur as a result of elective surgery or in the case of a chronically ill patient who has a long terminal hospitalization. Such claims are denied.

1. Patient's Physician Does Not Have Staff Privileges at a Participating Hospital

The fact that the beneficiary's attending physician does not have staff privileges at a participating hospital has no bearing on the emergency services determination. If the lack of staff privileges in an accessible participating hospital is the governing factor in the decision to admit the beneficiary to an "emergency hospital," the claim is denied irrespective of the seriousness of the medical situation.

1. Beneficiary Chooses to be Admitted to a Nonparticipating Hospital

The claim is denied if the beneficiary chooses to be admitted to a non-participating hospital as a personal preference (e.g., participating hospital is on the other side of town) when a bed for the required service is available in an accessible, participating hospital.

1. Beneficiary Cannot be Cared for Adequately at Home

The patient who cannot be cared for adequately at home does not necessarily require emergency services. The claim is denied in the absence of an injury, the appearance of a disease or disorder, or an acute change in a pre-existing disease state which poses an immediate threat to the life or health of the individual and which necessitates the use of the most accessible hospital equipped to furnish emergency services.

1. Lack of Suitable Transportation to a Participating Hospital

Lack of transportation to a participating hospital does not, in and of itself, constitute a reason for emergency services. The availability of suitable transportation can be considered only when the beneficiary's medical condition contraindicates taking the time to arrange transportation to a participating hospital. The claim is denied if there is no immediate threat to the life or health of the individual, and time could have been taken to arrange transportation to a participating hospital.

1. "Emergency Condition" Develops Subsequent to a Non-emergency Admission to a Nonparticipating Hospital

Program payment cannot be made for emergency services furnished by a nonparticipating hospital when the emergency condition arises after a non-emergency admission. An example: treatment of postoperative complications following an elective surgical procedure or treatment of a myocardial infarction that occurred during a hospitalization for an elective surgical procedure. The existence of medical necessity for emergency services is based upon the physician's initial assessment of the apparent condition of the patient at the time of the patient's arrival at the hospital, i.e., prior to admission.

1. Additional "Emergency Condition" Develops Subsequent to an Emergency Admission to a Nonparticipating Hospital

If the patient enters a nonparticipating hospital under an emergency situation and subsequently has other injuries, diseases or disorders, or acute changes in preexisting disease conditions, related or unrelated to the condition for which the patient entered, which pose an immediate threat to life or health, emergency services coverage continues.

Emergency services coverage ends when it becomes safe from a medical standpoint to move the patient to an available bed in a participating institution or to discharge the patient, whichever occurs first.

1. Documenting Medical Necessity

1. Physician's Supporting Statement

Claims for emergency services by a non-participating hospital should be accompanied by an Attending Physician's Statement and Documentation of Medicare Emergency, Form CMS-1771 or its equivalent. This form describes the nature of the emergency, furnishing relevant clinical information about the patient, and certifying that the services rendered were required as emergency services. However, a copy of the patient's hospital records may be submitted instead. It should include history, physical, and admission notes, the medical record admission sheet, nurses' notes, doctors' orders, discharge summary, and all progress notes. A statement that an emergency existed, or the listing of diagnoses, without supporting information, is not sufficient. In addition, the statement must include the date, in the physician's judgment, the emergency ceased. The physician who attended the patient at the hospital makes the statement concerning emergency services. Only in exceptional situations, with appropriate justification, may another physician having full knowledge of the case, make the certification.

1. Beneficiary's Statement in Canadian Travel Claims

In Canadian travel claims, the beneficiary's statement is considered in making a determination regarding medical necessity for emergency services; i.e., whether an emergency occurred while a beneficiary was traveling between Alaska and another State by the most direct route without unreasonable delay. (See [§350.4](#_bookmark255).)

1. # <a name="_bookmark268"></a>**- Time Limitation on Emergency and Foreign Claims**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

The regular time limits apply to requests and claims for payment for emergency hospital services and hospital services outside the U.S., for physician and ambulance services furnished in connection with foreign hospitalization, and for nonemergency services furnished by a domestic nonparticipating hospital. See chapter 1 for a description of these requirements.

1. Beneficiary Denial Notices

MACs shall send denial letters for non-covered foreign related claims.

Part B MACs will send an MSN for covered foreign emergency and shipboard claims related to a covered Part A foreign claim. An MSN is also sent for shipboard services provided within US territories.

1. Termination of Emergency Services

No payment will be made for inpatient or outpatient emergency services rendered after a reasonable period of medical care in relation to the emergency condition in question. Some services may be covered in a domestic nonparticipating hospital as Part B Medical and Other Health Services. (See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 6.) If, based upon all information, the total period claimed for emergency services coverage does not exceed the time required for a reasonable period of emergency medical care, the entire inpatient stay is covered. The fact that a medical record or other information states that the patient showed definite improvement several days prior to discharge is not necessarily an indication that the need for emergency services ceased as of that date. The concept of a reasonable period of emergency medical care is most easily applied when relatively short-term medical care is followed by the patient’s progressive improvement. There are situations or conditions in which the determination of the end of covered emergency services may be more difficult because the patient’s impairment is prolonged, there is no progressive improvement, or the patient’s course may be progressively downhill, even though the condition is not critical. The stroke patient may be in this category. In such cases the need for emergency medical care usually ceases before the need for medical care in an institutional setting (i.e., hospital or SNF) ceases. Thus, the reasonable period of emergency care does not include the entire hospital stay if the stay was prolonged beyond the point when major diagnostic evaluation and treatment were carried out.

The MAC will make the determination based upon all information available. As a general rule, if the period claimed for emergency services exceeds by more than 3 to 5 days the date on which the record definitely indicates that there was substantial improvement in the patient’s condition so that the patient could possibly have been moved to a participating facility or discharged without damage to health, the period beyond the 3 to 5 days is denied. If the total period claimed for emergency services exceeds by no more than 3 to 5 days the date on which the record indicates substantial improvement in the patient’s condition, the entire period is allowed.

This rule is intended to screen out short stay emergency hospitalization cases in which the patient was either discharged or transferred to a participating provider within a reasonable time after the medical record definitely indicated substantial improvement in the patient’s condition.

The reasonable period of emergency care is that period required to provide relief of acute symptoms or for initial management of the condition while arrangements are made for definitive treatment. Two examples:

0. Prostatic hypertrophy which results in acute urinary retention; and

0. Mental illness with suicidal and/or homicidal tendencies.

In acute urinary retention, the reasonable period of emergency medical care includes the period required for catheterization and stabilization of the patient. The patient could then be transferred to a participating hospital for surgery or other required treatment. For the suicidal or homicidal patient, a reasonable period of emergency medical care includes the time required for initial management of the case while arrangements are made for transfer (by commitment or otherwise) to a participating hospital. A period of 24 to 48 hours of emergency care is usually sufficient in both cases.

1. # <a name="_bookmark269"></a>**– Payment Denial for Medicare Services furnished to Alien Beneficiaries Who are Not Lawfully Present in the United States**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

Medicare payment may not be made for items and services furnished to an alien beneficiary who was not lawfully present in the United States on the date of service.

The CWF must establish an auxiliary file based on enrollment data contained in the Enrollment Data Base maintained by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in order to appropriately edit the claims specifically associated with alien beneficiaries. The auxiliary file will be the basis for an edit that rejects claims for a beneficiary that was not lawfully present in the U.S. on the date of service. MACs and DMACs must deny claims for items and services, rejected by CWF on the basis that the beneficiary was not lawfully present in the U.S. on the date of service. MACs and DMACs must refer to the CWF documentation on this subject for the error code MSN Message 5.7, assigned to this editing.

Upon receipt of an error code MSN Message 5.7, A/B MACs, DME MACs, and A/B MACs (HHH) must deny the claim and use reason code (CARC) 177 – “Patient has not met the required eligibility requirements.” When CWF rejects a claim, MACs and DMACs must use MSN message 5.7, “Medicare payment may not be made for the item or service because, on the date of service, you were not lawfully present in the United States.” 5.7, Medicare no puede pagar por este artículo o servicio porque, en la fecha en que lo recibió, usted no estaba legalmente en los Estados Unidos.

A party to a claim denied in whole or in part under this policy may appeal the initial determination on the basis that the beneficiary was lawfully present in the United States on the date of service. In addition, this same information must be published in your next regularly scheduled bulletin. If you have a listserv that targets the affected provider communities, you must use it to notify subscribers that information “Medicare Services for Alien Beneficiaries Lawfully present the United States” is available on your Web site.

**NOTE:** Section 401 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), codified at 8 U.S.C. §1611, prohibits aliens who are not “qualified aliens” from receiving Federal public benefits including Medicare.

However, Section 5561 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) amended Section 401 of the PRWORA to create a Medicare exemption to the prohibition on eligibility for non-qualified alien beneficiaries, who are lawfully present in the United States and who meet certain other conditions. Specifically, payment may be made for services furnished to an alien who is lawfully present in the United States (and provided that with respect to benefits payable under Part A of Title XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq.], who was authorized to be employed with respect to any wages attributable to employment which are counted for purposes of eligibility for Medicare benefits). The definition for “lawfully present in the United States” is found at 8 CFR 1.3.

1. # <a name="_bookmark270"></a>**- Appeals on Claims for Emergency and Foreign Services**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

When a MAC receives a beneficiary appeal of a claim submitted by the beneficiary for services provided by a non- participating provider, the MAC will process the appeal in accordance with the guidelines in Pub. 100-04 chapter 29.

When a MAC receives an appeal from a non-participating provider of a claim that was submitted by, or on behalf of, a beneficiary, the MAC shall dismiss the appeal request as the non-participating provider is not a proper party. The MAC shall send a copy of the dismissal to the beneficiary. A non-participating provider does not have standing to file an appeal for the individual claims for payment it submits on behalf of a beneficiary, or for claims the beneficiary submits for services it has furnished. See, 42 CFR 405.906(a)(3) and 405.902 (for the definition of provider); Pub. 100-04, chapter 29, §210 and the glossary in Pub. 100-04, chapter 29, §110 (for the definition of provider). Only a beneficiary (or the beneficiary’s authorized representative, or an appointed representative on behalf of the beneficiary) can appeal claim determinations for services furnished by a non-participating provider.

**NOTE:** Non-participating providers have appeal rights under the provider and supplier enrollment appeals process in 42 CFR Part 498 for MAC determinations related to the non-participating provider’s election to file claims (see §350.10).

**NOTE:** The RRB conducts Part B redeterminations under the Railroad Retirement Act for services rendered in Canada.

360. # <a name="_bookmark271"></a>**- Payment for Services Received By Nonparticipating Providers**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

The condition of payment regulations for emergency services received in Nonparticipating Providers can be found in the 42 CFR 424.100-109, Subpart G—Special Conditions: Emergency Services Furnished by a Nonparticipating Hospital.

The Form CMS-1450 or its electronic equivalent must be used.

1. Hospital Filed Claims

1. Inpatient Services

The payment rate for inpatient claims is 100 percent of the nonparticipating provider’s customary charges (see 42 C.F.R. 413.74(b) and 42 C.F.R. 424.104(a)(3)).

The cost of the services is adjusted by any applicable deductible and coinsurance amounts for which the beneficiary is responsible.

Payment will be made to Federal hospitals that furnish emergency services, on an inpatient basis, to individuals entitled to hospital benefits. Payment will be based on the lower of the actual charges from the hospital or rates published for Federal hospitals in the “Federal Register” under Office of Management and Budget - Cost of Hospital and Medical Care and Treatment Furnished by the United States; Certain Rates Regarding Recovery from Tortiously Liable Third Persons.

Medicare will not pay federal hospitals for emergency items or services furnished to veterans, retired military personnel or eligible dependents. However, Medicare can pay for the inpatient deductible charged by VA hospitals, or credit that amount to the Medicare Part A deductible, for emergency services furnished to veterans. If a Part A claim is denied, a denial notice will be forwarded to the beneficiary from the MAC. The beneficiary can use this notice to forward to their private insurer, if applicable.

The VA or Department Of Defense hospital must file a statement of election for each calendar year to receive direct payment from Medicare for all claims filed that year.

1. Outpatient Services

The amount paid by Medicare for emergency outpatient claims is obtained as follows:

0. Eighty-five percent of the total covered charges is the estimated cost figure. The applicable Part B deductible is subtracted. Coinsurance is subtracted from the remainder.

0. Subtracting the deductible from 85 percent of the total covered charges and applying the 20 percent coinsurance rate to the remainder obtains the patient’s coinsurance amount. The hospital will be paid cost (85 percent of covered charges) minus deductible and coinsurance.

1. Part B Medical and Other Health Services

Part B medical and other health services, including hospital-based ambulance services whether hospital or beneficiary filed, may be covered and paid on a non-emergency basis. To calculate the amount paid by Medicare, the hospital subtracts the Part B deductible from the total covered charges and applies the 80 percent payment rate.

1. Special Letters for Partially or Totally Denied (Hospital-Filed) Claims for Emergency Inpatient Services

The patient receives a notice from CMS covering the emergency payment of a partially denied claim. A denial letter and a Part B explanation of benefits is sent to the patient. The MAC includes its address on this letter.

1. Beneficiary Filed Claim

1. Emergency Inpatient Claims The payment computation follows:
   0. Any noncovered accommodation charge is subtracted from the total accommodation charges. The amount of the inpatient deductible or coinsurance met on this bill is subtracted. Any remainder is multiplied by 60 percent.

0. The total noncovered ancillary charge is subtracted from the total ancillary charge. Any inpatient deductible or coinsurance that remains is subtracted. The remainder is multiplied by 80 percent.

0. The benefit amounts obtained are added.

1. Emergency Outpatient Services

To calculate the amount paid by Medicare, the hospital must subtract any applicable Part B deductible from the total covered charges and apply the 80 percent payment rate.

1. Part B Medical and Other Health Services

Part B medical and other health services furnished by nonparticipating hospitals, including hospital-based ambulance services, may be covered and paid on a non-emergency basis.

To calculate the amount paid by Medicare, the hospital must subtract any applicable Part B deductible from the total covered charges and apply an 80 percent payment rate.

1. Special Letters for Patient-Filed Claims for Emergency Inpatient Services

For emergency admissions to nonparticipating hospitals where direct payment is made to the patient, the MAC sends the beneficiary one of the letters described below, as appropriate.

The letter explains the Part A payments made. Part B payments are made for ancillary services not covered by Part A and are also explained in a letter. This letter also explains the beneficiary’s right of appeal.

The MAC retains a duplicate of all notices sent for documentation in any appeals process. It enters the date the notice is released on both copies of all notices.

Sample paragraphs:

0. “Enclosed is a check for $	, which is the amount Medicare can pay for inpatient hospital services you received from (date of admission) to (date of discharge) in (hospital).”

0. “Medicare is able to pay 60 percent of the charges for your room and board plus 80 percent of the charges for all other covered services during the period (date emergency began) to (date payment ended).”

“Medicare is able to pay 60 percent of the charges for your room and board, 80 percent of the charges for other separately identified charges, and 66 2/3 percent of the other charges which were not separately identified on the hospital bill.”

0. “Medicare does not pay (the first $ 	 of charges) (the first three pints of blood) ($ 	 a day after the 60th day) in a benefit period. (Select one or more, if applicable.)”

0. “If lifetime reserve days are used, add $ 	 a day from 	 to 	.”

0. “If you believe your Medicare hospital insurance should have covered all or more of your expenses, you may get in touch with us at the address shown on this letter.”

0. “If you believe that the determination is not correct, you may request a reconsideration for hospital insurance (or a review for medical insurance). You may make the request by mail to the address shown on this letter. If you come in person, please bring this notice with you.”

0. “This check includes a medical insurance payment for 80 percent of the charges for certain nonroutine hospital services which you received from 	 through 	. These services are listed on the enclosed form.”

0. “If a hospital bill is not itemized, Medicare can pay 66 2/3 percent of the total covered charges. Payment is being made at this rate for charges from (date emergency began) to (date payment ended).”

0. “We are enclosing a check for $ 	. This is your payment under Part B for 80 percent of the charges for the services which you received from (admission date) through (discharge date) while in (name of hospital). These services are listed on the enclosed form.”

When payment cannot be made under hospital insurance, medical insurance covers some, but not all, of the hospital services. Room and board and certain other services are not covered by medical insurance.

1. # <a name="_bookmark272"></a>**- Payment for Services from Foreign Hospitals**
## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

The condition of payment regulations for emergency services received in Nonparticipating Providers can be found in the 42 CFR 424.100-109, Subpart G—Special Conditions: Emergency Services Furnished by a Nonparticipating Hospital

1. Hospital Filed Claim

A foreign hospital that elects to bill the Medicare program receives 100 percent of its customary charges, subject to applicable deductible and coinsurance amounts. The hospital establishes its customary charges for the services by submitting an itemized bill with each claim. This eliminates the need to file a cost report.

Regardless of the billing form used, the MAC must:

0. Recode the bill using revenue codes for the Form CMS-1450;

0. Prepare an HUIP or HUOP input record for CWF; and

0. Send a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) to the beneficiary.

The nonparticipating hospital must file a statement of election for each calendar year to receive direct payment from Medicare for all claims filed that year.

Payment is subject to the official exchange rate on the date the patient is discharged.

1. Beneficiary Filed Claim

To calculate the amount paid by Medicare for Part B Hospital-Based Ambulance Claims, the hospital must subtract any unmet Part B deductible from the total covered charges and apply the 80 percent payment rate.

Payment to the beneficiary is subject to the official exchange rate on the date of discharge.

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES REFER TO:

Identification Number:	

Dear 	:

Your election to bill the Medicare program for emergency services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries will expire on December 31. Payment for emergency services can be made to a nonparticipating hospital only if the hospital elects to receive reimbursement from Medicare for all emergency services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in a calendar year.

If you elect to bill the program, please return to us in the enclosed self-addressed envelope a statement signed by an authorized official of your hospital stating that you elect to claim payment under the Medicare program. An election to bill cannot be withdrawn during the year. If a statement is not received by December 31, we will assume that you do not wish to continue to bill the program at this time. However, you still retain the right to elect to bill the program at any time during the coming year if, when you make your election, you have not yet charged any Medicare beneficiary in that year for emergency hospital services rendered to him.

Hospitals electing to bill the program for emergency services may obtain information on reimbursement by contacting the MAC serving nonparticipating hospitals in your State. If you do not elect to bill, the beneficiary may apply for reimbursement by submitting an itemized bill.

Please contact us if you need any further information. In addition, if at any time you decide to request full participation as a provider of hospital services under the Medicare program, please contact your Medicare MAC for complete particulars.

Sincerely,

## **(Rev. 3287, Issued: 06-30-15, Effective: 04-21-15, Implementation: 04-21-15)**

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES

REFER TO:

Identification Number:	

Dear 	:

Under the Medicare program, hospital benefits ordinarily can be paid only for care furnished to patients of hospitals that are participating in the program. However, the program can also pay for hospital services furnished to a beneficiary who is admitted to a nonparticipating hospital in an emergency. To receive payments for emergency services, a nonparticipating hospital must meet certain conditions specified in the law. We have determined that your hospital meets these conditions.

Payment for emergency services can be made to a nonparticipating hospital only if the hospital elects to receive reimbursement from Medicare for all emergency services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in a calendar year. Although your hospital did not elect to bill the program for the current calendar year, you may wish to bill for the coming year. If you so choose, please have an authorized official of your hospital sign a statement to this effect and return in the enclosed self-addressed envelope. Retain a copy for your records. An election to bill cannot be withdrawn during the year.

If we have not received a statement from you by December 31, we will assume that you do not wish to bill the program at this time. However, you still retain the right to elect to bill the program at any time during the coming year if, when you make your election, you have not yet charged any Medicare beneficiary in that year for emergency hospital services rendered to him.

Hospitals electing to bill the program for emergency services may obtain information on reimbursement by contacting us. If a hospital does not elect to bill, the beneficiary may apply for reimbursement by submitting an itemized bill.

If at any time you decide to request full participation as a provider of hospital services under the Medicare program, please contact your Medicare intermediary for complete particulars.

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES REFER TO:

Identification Number:	

Dear 	:

This refers to your inquiry concerning payment for emergency hospital services rendered to a Medicare beneficiary in a hospital which is not participating in the Medicare program. Under the Medicare program, hospital benefits ordinarily can be paid only for care furnished to patients of hospitals that are participating in the program. However, the program can also pay for hospital services furnished to a beneficiary who is admitted to a nonparticipating hospital in an emergency. To receive payments for emergency services, a nonparticipating hospital must meet certain conditions specified in the law. We have determined that your hospital meets these conditions.

Payment for emergency services can be made to a nonparticipating hospital only if you elect to receive reimbursement from Medicare for all emergency services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in a calendar year. Your hospital may now choose to bill the program for all emergency services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries during the current calendar year, if you have not yet charged any Medicare beneficiary this year for emergency hospital services rendered to him.

If you so choose, please have an authorized official of your hospital sign a statement to this effect and return in the enclosed self-addressed envelope. Retain a copy for your records. An election to bill cannot be withdrawn during the year.

Hospitals electing to bill the program for emergency services may obtain information on reimbursement by contacting us. If you do not elect to bill, the beneficiary may apply for reimbursement by submitting an itemized bill.

If at any time you decide to request full participation as a provider of hospital services under the Medicare program, please contact your Medicare intermediary for complete particulars.

DETERMINATION ON EMERGENCY HOSPITAL SERVICES


We are sorry, but payment cannot be made for your stay from 	 through 	 at (hospital). This is because the (hospital) does not participate in the Medicare program and it has been determined that your treatment there does not qualify as emergency care.

Under the law, payment for services received in a nonparticipating hospital can be made only if you go, or are brought to, the hospital to receive emergency care. Emergency care under Medicare is defined as:

1. Care which is necessary to prevent the death or serious impairment to the health of the individual; and

1. Which, because of threat to the life or health of the individual, requires the use of the nearest hospital (in miles or travel time) that has a bed available and is equipped to handle the emergency.

The medical facts of your hospital admission and stay have been carefully reviewed. Based upon this review, we have found that, although it was necessary for you to be hospitalized, a medical emergency did not exist. There would have been time for you to have been admitted to a hospital participating in Medicare.

If you have questions about this notice, you may call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) for additional information. If you believe the determination is not correct, you may request a redetermination. You must file your request within 120 days from the date you receive this notice. A request for a redetermination must be filed either on Form CMS- 20027 or on a written request that includes all of the elements listed below.

- Beneficiary name
- Medicare beneficiary identifier
- Specific service and/or item(s) for which a redetermination is being requested

DETERMINATION ON FOREIGN HOSPITAL SERVICES

We are sorry, but payment cannot be made for your stay

from	through

`	`at (hospital) in (country).

Medicare law prohibits payment for items and services furnished outside the United States except in certain limited circumstances. The term “outside the U.S.” means anywhere other than the 50 states of the U.S., the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

There are three situations when Medicare may pay for certain types of health care services rendered in a foreign hospital (a hospital outside the U.S.):

1. You’re in the U.S. when you have a medical emergency and the foreign hospital is closer than the nearest

U.S. hospital that can treat your illness or injury.

1. You’re traveling through Canada without unreasonable delay by the most direct route between Alaska and another state when a medical emergency occurs, and the Canadian hospital is closer than the nearest U.S. hospital that can treat your illness or injury. Medicare determines what qualifies as “without unreasonable delay” on a case-by-case basis.
1. You live in the U.S. and the foreign hospital is closer to your home than the nearest U.S. hospital that can treat your medical condition, regardless of whether it’s an emergency.

In these situations, Medicare will pay only for the Medicare-covered services you get in a foreign hospital.

If you have a supplemental insurance policy, you should check with the company carrying that policy to see if they cover these services and what procedures you should follow in submitting your claim.

If you have questions about this notice, you may call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) for additional information. If you believe the determination is not correct, you may request a redetermination. You must file your request within 120 days from the date you receive this notice.

## **(Rev. 3265, Issued: 05-22-15, Effective: 01-13-15, Implementation: 06-23-15)**

On March 21, 2006, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began national coverage of microvolt T- wave Alternans (MTWA) diagnostic testing when it was performed using only the spectral analysis (SA) method for the evaluation of patients at risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) from ventricular arrhythmias and patients who may be candidates for Medicare coverage of the placement of an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD).

Effective for claims with dates of service on and after January 13, 2015, Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) may determine coverage of MTWA diagnostic testing when it is performed using methods of analysis other than SA for the evaluation of patients at risk for SCD from ventricular arrhythmias. Further information can be found at Publication 100-03, section 20.30, of the National Coverage Determinations Manual.

## **(Rev. 11021; Issued: 10-01-21; Effective: 10-29-21; Implementation: 10-29-21)**

Effective for claims with dates of service on and after March 21, 2006, MACs shall accept CPT 93025 (MTWA for assessment of ventricular arrhythmias) for MTWA diagnostic testing for the evaluation of patients at risk for SCD with the SA method of analysis only. All other methods of analysis for MTWA are non-covered.

Effective for claims with dates of service on and after January 13, 2015, MACs shall at their discretion determine coverage for CPT 93025 for MTWA diagnostic testing for the evaluation of patients at risk for SCD with methods of analysis other than SA. The –KX modifier shall be used as an attestation by the practitioner and/or provider of the service that documentation is on file verifying the MTWA was performed using a method of analysis other than SA for the evaluation of patients at risk for SCD from ventricular arrhythmias and that all other NCD criteria was met.

**NOTE:** The –KX modifier is NOT required on MTWA claims for the evaluation of patients at risk for SCD if the SA analysis method is used.

**NOTE:** This diagnosis code list/translation was approved by CMS/Coverage. It may or may not be a complete list of covered indications/diagnosis codes that are covered but should serve as a finite starting point.

As this policy indicates, individual A/B MACs within their respective jurisdictions have the discretion to make coverage determinations they deem reasonable and necessary under section 1862(a)1)(A) of the Social Security Act. Therefore, A/B MACs may have additional covered diagnosis codes in their individual policies where contractor discretion is appropriate.

1. # **– Billing Information for Professional Claims**
## **(Rev. 11721; Issued: 11-28-22; Effective: 01-01-23; Implementation: 01-03-23)**

Professional claims for CAR T-cell therapy and related services are billed using the Form CMS-1500 or 837P following instructions in chapter 12 of this manual ([www.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/104_claims/clm104index.asp).](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/104_claims/clm104index.asp\))

Contractors shall pay professional claims for CAR T-cell therapy when the service is administered at a healthcare facility that is enrolled in the REMS program as a REMS participating site. Contractors shall use the CMS HCPCS Website for current HCPCS codes, https://[www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets/HCPCS-Quarterly-](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets/HCPCS-Quarterly-) Update, and the individual REMS facility websites noted at section 400.1.

Contractors shall create an edit that only allows CAR T-cell therapy services to be submitted by, or performed in, an FDA REMS approved facility when the line item has a -KX modifier appended. **Note:** When a provider submits a -KX modifier on CAR T-cell therapy services, they are acknowledging that the service is being submitted by or performed in an FDA REMS approved facility.

Contractors shall create an edit that only allows CAR T-cell therapy services when the line item has a -LU modifier appended in addition to a -KX modifier. **Note:** When a provider submits an	-LU modifier on a CAR T-cell claim, it informs the MAC that the service is fractionated. The total units shall not exceed 1 unit.

Contractors shall set up their systems to allow fractionated units on multiple claims for CAR T-cell products on the same DOS. These claims should suspend for proper adjudication of payment.

The total payment will be divided by 10 and the provider will need to bill in 0.1 unit fractions. The provider will need to bill a total of 10 fractional units to reach the total Medicare allowed payment amount.

Example: CAR T-cell product allowed payment $445,000:

0\.2 units = $89,000.06

0\.2 units = $89,000.00

0\.2 units = $88,999.99

0\.2 units = $88,999.98

0\.2 units = $88,999.97

**Note:** Contractors shall only pay up to 1 unit, anything exceeding 1 unit must be denied.

For CAR T-cell products when the dose exceeds the code descriptor, use HCPCS code J3490, J3590, or J9999 for the exceeded dosage. Include the CAR T-cell product name and the exceeded dosage in Block 19 of the 1500 claim form or its electronic equivalent.

Example: CAR T-cell product with dose exceeded allowed payment $150,000:

0\.5 units = $74,999.00

0\.5 units = $75,001.00

For CAR T-cell products when the dose exceeds the code descriptor, the provider would bill a total of 1 unit of the Q code plus a total of 1 unit of the J code.

For example, Q2041 Axicabtagene ciloleucel, up to 200 million autologous anti-CD19 CAR positive T- cells. If the provider gives 300 million cells, they will bill:

Q2041 for 0.1 fraction $42,294.00 x10 for 200 million cells (total $422,940.00) J9999 for 0.2 fractions $42,294.00 x5 for 100 million cells (total $211,470.00)

NOTE: The FDA labels for CAR T-cell products state the maximum number of cells that are to be infused. The HCPCS code descriptors for Q2041, Q2042, Q2053, Q2054, Q2055, and Q2056 all align with the FDA label maximum number of cells that are to be infused. If a provider exceeds the HCPCS code descriptor number of cells, this is off label use.

This should be extremely rare.

Contractors shall allow a -76 modifier (repeat procedure or service by same physician or other qualified healthcare professional) on subsequent claims billed on the same date of service to assist with preventing duplicate denials.

1. # **- Payment Requirements**
## **(Rev. 10891, Issued: 07-20-21, Effective: 08-07-19, Implementation: 09-20-21)**

Inpatient

The A/ B MAC billing requirements will allow for CAR T-cell therapy when the services are submitted on the following TOB: 11X. Type of facility and setting determines the basis of payment:

For services performed in inpatient hospitals, TOB 11X, under the Inpatient PPS is based on the Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG).

For services performed in Critical Access Hospital (CAH) inpatient TOB 11X, payment is based on 101% of reasonable cost.

Outpatient

The A/B MAC billing requirements will pay for CAR T-cell therapy when the services are submitted on the TOBs: 13X and 85x. Type of facility and setting determines the basis of payment:

For services performed in hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs), TOBs 13X, or inpatient ancillary TOB 12X, payment is based on OPPS.

For services performed in CAH OPDs, TOB 85X, payment is based on reasonable cost.

For services performed in CAH Method II with revenue code 096X, 097X, and 098X, TOB 85X, payment is based on the lesser of the actual charge or the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (115% of the lesser of the fee schedule amount and submitted charge).

HOPDs may report CPT codes 0537T, 0538T, and 0539T to allow tracking of these services when furnished in the outpatient setting. Medicare will reject these lines as Medicare does not separately pay for these services under the OPPS.

These following scenarios present further clarification on how to report items and services related to CAR-T in various clinical scenarios.

## **Scenario 1: CAR-T Dosing and Preparation Services and Viable T-cells Administered in HOPDs**:

In instances when you administer the CAR-T drug in the HOPD setting, report CPT code 0540T for the administration and HCPCS Q2041, Q2042, Q2053 (effective April 1, 2021), C9073 (prior to April 1, 2021), C9076, or, if a more specific code is unavailable, the most appropriate unclassified drug code (e.g., C9399 for unclassified drugs or biologicals). NOTE: the drug codes will be denied as a Part A service even if billed with the administration.) For specific instructions on billing unclassified drug codes, refer to Chapter 26, Section 10.4 of the “Medicare Claims Processing Manual” on the CMS website at: Regulations-and-Guidance.Ch26. As discussed in the Calendar Year (CY) 2019 OPPS/Ambulatory Surgery Center final rule (83 FR 58904), the procedures described by CPT 0537T (collection/handling), 0538T (preparation for transport), and 0539T (receipt and preparation) represent the various steps required to collect and prepare the genetically modified T-cells, and these steps are not paid separately under the OPPS. However, you may report the charges for these various steps to collect and prepare the CAR T-cells separately and Medicare will reject them on the HOPD claim, or they may be included in the charge reported for the biological.

**Note**: When including the charges for collection and preparation of the CAR T-cells in the charge for the CAR-T product, outpatient providers should code the CAR-T product service on the date that the CAR-T administration took place and not on the date when the cells were collected.

## **Scenario 2: CAR-T Dosing and Preparation Services Administered in HOPD Setting, but Viable T-cells Not Administered:**

In instances when the CAR-T drug is not ultimately administered to the beneficiary, but the CAR-T preparation services are initiated or performed in the HOPD facility, the hospital may not report the drug Q code (which only applies when the T-cells are administered in the HOPD setting). HOPDs may report CPT 0537T, 0538T, and 0539T (as appropriate) and the charges associated with each code under the appropriate revenue code on the HOPD claim. Medicare will reject these codes.

## **Scenario 3: CAR-T Dosing and Preparation Services Administered in HOPD Setting, but Viable T-cells Administered in the Hospital Inpatient Setting:**

When CAR T-cell preparation services are initiated and furnished in the HOPD setting, but the CAR T-cells are administered in the inpatient setting, the hospital may not report the drug Q code (which only applies when the T-cells are administered in the HOPD setting). Report the charge associated with the various steps to collect and prepare the CAR T-cells on the inpatient claim (TOB 11x) separately using revenue codes 0871, 0872, or 0873. Alternatively, the hospital may include the charges for these various steps in the charge reported for the biological using revenue code 0891 – Special Processed Drugs – FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) Approved Cell Therapy – Charges for Modified cell therapy.

**Note**: When the cells are collected in the HOPD setting and the CAR-T is administered in the hospital inpatient setting, inpatient providers should report the date that the CAR-T administration took place and not the date the cells were collected.

Physician Office or Non-Hospital Clinic

The A/B MAC billing requirements will pay for CAR T-cell therapy when the services are submitted on the Form CMS-1500 or electronic 837P.

## **Scenario 1: CAR-T Dosing and Preparation Services and Viable T-cells Administered in Physician Office or Non- Hospital Clinic**:

For specific instructions on billing unclassified drug codes, refer to Chapter 26, Section 10.4 of the “Medicare Claims Processing Manual” on the CMS website at: [Regulations-and-Guidance.Ch26.](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/clm104c26.pdf)

The procedures described by CPT 0537T (collection/handling), 0538T (preparation for transport), and 0539T (receipt and preparation) represent the various steps required to collect and prepare the genetically modified T-cells, and these steps are not paid separately under the MPFS. However, you may report them separately, and Medicare will reject them on the professional claim.

**Note**: Practitioners should code the CAR-T product service on the date that the CAR-T administration took place and not on the date when the cells were collected.

1. ## **Beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans**

Effective for clams with dates of service on and after August 7, 2019, CMS determined that the NCD requiring coverage of CAR T-cell therapy for cancer is a significant cost under section 422.109(a)(2) of title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations. As a result, for CYs 2019 (beginning August 7, 2019) and 2020 only, original fee-for-service Medicare will pay for CAR T-cell therapy for cancer obtained by beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans when the coverage criteria outlined in the NCD are met. Plans should account for CAR T-cell therapy for cancer items and services in their contract year 2021 bids.

Consistent with §1862 (t)(2) of the Act, MACs will pay for CAR T-cell therapy for cancer for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans in CYs 2019 (beginning August 7, 2019) and 2020.

Up to 12 visits in 90 days are covered for Medicare beneficiaries under the following circumstances:

0. For the purpose of this decision, cLBP is defined as:

   0. Lasting 12 weeks or longer;
   0. nonspecific, in that it has no identifiable systemic cause (i.e., not associated with metastatic, inflammatory, infectious, etc. disease);
   0. not associated with surgery; and
   0. not associated with pregnancy.
0. An additional 8 sessions will be covered for those patients demonstrating an improvement. No more than 20 acupuncture treatments may be administered annually. Example: If the 1st service is performed on March 21, 2020, the next service beginning a new year cannot be performed until March 1, 2021. This means 11 full months must pass from the date of the 1<sup>st</sup> service before eligibility begins again.

# **411– Home Infusion Therapy Services**
**(Rev. 10269, Issued: 08-07-2020, Effective: 01-01-2021, Implementation: 01-04-2021)**

1. # <a name="_bookmark308"></a>**– Policy**
## **(Rev. 10269, Issued: 08-07-2020, Effective: 01-01-2021, Implementation: 01-04-2021)**

Effective beginning on January 1, 2021, the Medicare home infusion therapy benefit covers the professional services, including nursing services, furnished in accordance with the plan of care, patient training and education (not otherwise covered under the durable medical equipment benefit), remote monitoring, and monitoring services for the provision of home infusion therapy and home infusion drugs furnished by a qualified home infusion therapy supplier. Home infusion therapy means the items and services furnished by a qualified home infusion therapy supplier, which are furnished in the individual’s home. Payment is for an “infusion drug administration calendar day,” which means the day on which home infusion therapy services are furnished by skilled professionals in the individual’s home on the day of infusion drug administration. The skilled services provided on such day must be so inherently complex that they can only be safely and effectively performed by, or under the supervision of, professional or technical personnel.

1. # <a name="_bookmark309"></a>**– Coverage Requirements**
## **(Rev. 10269, Issued: 08-07-2020, Effective: 01-01-2021 Implementation: 01-04-2021)**

Payment for an “infusion drug administration calendar day” is only made if a beneficiary is furnished certain drugs and biologicals administered through an item of covered DME, and payable only to suppliers enrolled in Medicare as a “qualified home infusion therapy supplier.” The beneficiary must be under the care of an applicable provider, defined as a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician’s assistant, and must be under the care of a physician-established plan of care that prescribes the type, amount, and duration of infusion therapy services. A “qualified home infusion therapy supplier” is a pharmacy, physician, or other provider of services or supplier licensed by the state in which supplies or services are furnished. Qualified home infusion therapy suppliers must furnish infusion therapy to individuals with acute or chronic conditions requiring administration of home infusion drugs; ensure the safe and effective provision and administration of home infusion therapy on a 7-day-a-week, 24-hour-a-day basis; and be accredited by an organization designated by the Secretary. The supplier may subcontract with a pharmacy, physician, other qualified supplier or provider of services in order to meet these requirements.

## <a name="(rev. 11430; issued: 05-24-22; effective"></a>**(Rev. 11430; Issued: 05-24-22; Effective: 07-01-22; Implementation: 07-05-22)**
The home infusion therapy services payment is intended to cover the professional services needed for the administration of certain home infusion drugs covered as supplies necessary for the effective use of external infusion pumps. This payment separately and explicitly pays for the services related to the administration of the drugs identified on the DME LCD for External Infusion Pumps, when such services are furnished in the individual’s home. Section 1861(iii)(3)(C) of the Act defines “home infusion drug” as a parenteral drug or biological administered intravenously, or subcutaneously for an administration period of 15 minutes or more, in the home of an individual through a pump that is an item of durable medical equipment (as defined in section 1861(n) of the Act). Such term does not include insulin pump systems or self-administered drugs or biologicals on a self-administered drug exclusion list.

Home infusion drugs are assigned to three payment categories, as determined by the HCPCS J-code. Payment category 1 includes certain intravenous antifungals and antivirals, uninterrupted long-term infusions, pain management, inotropic, chelation drugs. Payment category 2 includes subcutaneous immunotherapy and other certain subcutaneous infusion drugs. Payment category 3 includes certain chemotherapy drugs. CMS will continue to use the G-codes, established for the temporary transitional payments in CYs 2019 and 2020, for the professional services furnished on an infusion drug administration calendar day for each payment category. CMS has established a single payment amount for each of the three categories for professional services furnished for each infusion drug administration calendar day. Each payment category will be paid at amounts in accordance with infusion codes and units for such codes under the physician fee schedule for each infusion drug administration calendar day in the individual’s home for drugs assigned to such category. The payment amounts are equal to 5 hours of infusion therapy in a physician’s office. Further policy information can be found in Publication 100-02, Chapter 15, Section 320.

## **(Rev. 10269, Issued: 08-07-2020, Effective: 01-01-2021, Implementation: 01-04-2021)**

Contractors shall accept and pay for home infusion therapy services to eligible home infusion therapy suppliers (new specialty **D6**) effective for claim lines with dates of service on or

after January 1, 2021 using the one of the following ‘G’ codes and applicable ‘J’ codes listed in section 411.3 of this chapter. Claims for the home infusion therapy service G- codes are billed to the A/B MACs and are payable to home infusion therapy suppliers; this service is no longer payable to DME suppliers. The applicable ‘J’ codes are billed to the DME MACs by the DME supplier.

Contractors shall use Type of Service (TOS) Code 1 for all six G-codes. Contractors shall pay only one of the G-codes per line item date of service when one of the drugs from the applicable category is billed with the same line item date of service or a date of service within 30 days prior to the G-code visit.

## **NOTE:**
0. The fees associated with the G-codes on the MPFSD fee file will be “a per day rate;” therefore, the units on the line should not be multiplied by the rate.

The drug remains separately payable from the G-code line item

Home infusion therapy suppliers will report the following HCPCS G-codes associated with the payment categories for the professional services furnished in the individual’s home and on an infusion drug administration calendar day.

Because the home infusion therapy services are contingent upon a home infusion drug J- code, home infusion therapy suppliers must ensure that the appropriate drug associated with the visit is billed no more than 30 days prior to the visit. In the event that multiple visits occur on the same date of service, or multiple drugs, which are not all assigned to the same payment category, are administered on the same infusion drug administration calendar day, a single payment would be made that is equal to the highest payment category. Suppliers must only bill for one visit and should report the highest paying visit with the applicable drug.

To differentiate the first visit from all subsequent visits, home infusion therapy suppliers may only bill one of the “initial visit” G-codes to indicate an visit for a new patient who had previously received their last home infusion therapy service visit more than 60 days prior to the new initial home infusion therapy service visit.

Home infusion therapy suppliers should report visit length in 15-minute increments (15 minutes=1 unit). See the Table 1 below for the rounding of units.

## **Table 1: Time Increments**


|Unit|Time|
| :- | :- |
|1|<23 minutes|
|2|= 23 minutes to <38 minutes|
|3|= 38 minutes to <53 minutes|
|4|= 53 minutes to <68 minutes|
