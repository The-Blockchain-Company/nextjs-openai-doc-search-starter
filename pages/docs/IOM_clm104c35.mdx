# - General Coverage and Payment Policies

### (Rev. 1506; Issued: 05-16-08; Effective/Implementation Date: 06-16-08)

> Effective for diagnostic procedures performed on or after March 15,
> 1999, A/B MACs
>
> \(B\) will pay for diagnostic procedures under the physician fee
> schedule only when performed by a physician, a group practice of
> physicians, an approved supplier of portable x-ray services, a nurse
> practitioner, or a clinical nurse specialist when he or she performs a
> test he or she is authorized by the State to perform, or an
> independent diagnostic testing facility (IDTF). An IDTF may be a fixed
> location or a mobile entity. It is independent of a physician\'s
> office or hospital.
>
> Refer to the Medicare Program Integrity Manual, Pub. 100-08, chapter
> 10, for information concerning provider enrollment and instructions
> regarding entities that must enroll as and bill for diagnostic
> procedures as an independent diagnostic testing facility (IDTF).

# - The Term "Independent Diagnostic Testing Facility (IDTF)"

### (Rev. 1506; Issued: 05-16-08; Effective/Implementation Date: 06-16-08)

> Consistent with 42 CFR 410. 33(a)(1), an IDTF is one that is
> independent both of an attending or consulting physician's office and
> of a hospital. However, IDTF general coverage and payment policy rules
> apply when an IDTF furnishes diagnostic procedures in a physician's
> office.

> ***(Rev. 4473, Issued: 12-6-19; Effective: 3-9-20; Implementation:
> 3-9-20)***

### Billing Issues

> Nothing in this document or in the Medicare Enrollment Application,
> (CMS-855B) or the Internet-based Provider Enrollment, Chain and
> Ownership System shall be construed or interpreted to authorize
> billing by an IDTF, physician, physician group practice, or any other
> entity that would otherwise violate the physician self-referral
> prohibition set forth in
>
> §1877 of the Social Security Act and related regulations. A/B MACs
> *(Part B)* must deny claims submitted in violation of §1877 and demand
> refunds of any payments that have been made in violation of §1877.
>
> Consistent with 42 CFR 410.32(a), the supervisory physician for the
> IDTF, whether or not for a mobile unit, may not order tests to be
> performed by the IDTF, unless the supervisory physician is the
> patient's treating physician and is not otherwise prohibited from
> referring to the IDTF. The supervisory physician is the patient's
> treating physician if he or she furnishes a consultation or treats the
> patient for a specific medical problem and uses the test results in
> the management of the patient's medical problem.
>
> If an IDTF wants to bill for an interpretation performed by a
> physician who does not share a practice with the IDTF, the IDTF must
> meet certain conditions concerning the
>
> anti-markup payment limitation. If a physician working for an IDTF (or
> a party related to the IDTF through common ownership or control as
> described in 42 CFR §413.17) does not order the *technical component
> or professional component* of a diagnostic test (excluding clinical
> diagnostic laboratory tests), it would not be subject to the
> anti-markup payment limitation. (See Pub. 100-04, chapter 1, §30.2.9)

### Transtelephonic and Electronic Monitoring Services

> Transtelephonic and electronic monitoring services (e.g., 24 hour
> ambulatory EKG monitoring, pacemaker monitoring and cardiac event
> detection) may perform some of their services without actually seeing
> the patient. Most but not all of these billing codes are 93012 ,93014,
> 93040, 93224, 93225, 93226, 93232, 93230, 93231, 93233, 93236,
>
> 93270, 93271, 93731, 93733, 93736, 95953, 95956, These monitoring
> service entities should be classified as IDTFs and must meet all IDTF
> requirements. We currently do not have specific certification
> standards for their technicians; technician credentialing requirements
> for them are at A/B MAC *(Part B)* discretion. They do require a
> supervisory physician who performs General Supervision. Final
> enrollment of a transtelephonic or electronic monitoring service as an
> IDTF requires a site visit.
>
> For any entity that lists and will bill codes 93012, 93014, 93268,
> 93270, 93271, 93272, the A/B MAC *(Part B)* must make a written
> determination that the entity actually has a person available on a 24
> hour basis to answer telephone inquiries. Use of an answering service
> in lieu of the actual person is not acceptable. The person performing
> the attended monitoring should be listed in Section 3 of Attachment 2
> of Form CMS-855B. The qualifications of the person are at the A/B MAC
> *(Part B)*'s discretion. The A/B MAC *(Part B)* shall check that the
> person is available by attempting to contact the applicant during
> non-standard business hours. In Particular, at least one of the
> contact calls should be made between midnight and 6:00 AM. If the
> applicant does not meet the availability standard they should receive
> a denial.

### Slide Preparation Facilities and Radiation Therapy Centers

> Slide Preparation Facilities and Radiation Therapy Centers are not
> IDTFs. Slide preparation facilities are entities that provide slide
> preparation services and other kinds of services that are payable
> through the technical component of the surgical pathology service.
> These entities do not provide the professional component of surgical
> pathology services or other kinds of laboratory tests. The services
> that they provide are recognized by A/B MACs *(Part B)* for payment,
> as codes in the surgical pathology code range (88300) to (88399) with
> a technical component value under the physician fee schedule.
>
> The services provided by these entities are usually ordered by and
> reviewed by a dermatologist. Slide preparation facilities generally
> only have one or two people performing this service.
>
> All enrolled Slide Preparation Facilities must enroll separately with
> their Medicare contractor. Radiation therapy centers provide
> therapeutic services and therefore are not IDTFs. Radiation therapy
> centers must enroll separately with their Medicare contractor.

## *-- Global Billing*

#### *(Rev. 4473, Issued: 12-6-19; Effective: 3-9-20; Implementation: 3-9-20)*

> *Global billing is acceptable when both the TC and 26 modifier are
> performed by the same entity and both the TC and the 26 modifier are
> furnished within the same Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS)
> payment locality. The TC and 26 may be furnished in different
> locations as long as they are furnished within the same MPFS payment
> locality.*
>
> *If the global diagnostic test code is billed, report the name,
> address and NPI of the location where the technical component was
> furnished in Items 32 and 32a (or the 837P electronic claim
> equivalent). See Pub. 100-04, chapter 1, §80.3.2.1.2 and 80.3.2.1.3
> for more information regarding what is required in Items 32 and 32a.*

## *--Separate Technical and Professional Component Billing*

#### *(Rev. 4473, Issued: 12-6-19; Effective: 3-9-20; Implementation: 3-9-20)*

> *When the TC and 26 modifier are billed separately (not billed
> globally), report the name, address and NPI of the location where each
> component was performed. If the billing provider has an enrolled
> practice location at the address where the service was performed, the
> billing provider/supplier may report their own name, address and NPI
> in Items 32 and 32a (or the 837P electronic claim equivalent).*
>
> *If the professional component service was performed at an unusual or
> infrequently used location, the location of the provider's/supplier's
> closest Medicare-enrolled practice location may be used in Item 32.*
>
> *The NPI in Item 32a must correspond to the entity identified in Item
> 32 (no matter if it is the group, hospital, the IDTF, or the
> individual physician). The only exception for Medicare claims is when
> a service is performed out of jurisdiction and is subject to the
> anti-markup or a reference lab service. See Pub. 100-04, chapter 1, §
> 30.2.9 and chapter 16, §40.1 for instructions specific to anti-markup
> and reference lab, respectively.*
>
> *See, Pub. 100-04, chapter 1, §80.3.2.1.2 and 80.3.2.1.3 for more
> information regarding what is required in Items 32 and 32a.*

# 20 - Ordering of Test

### (Rev. 1506; Issued: 05-16-08; Effective/Implementation Date: 06-16-08)

> All procedures performed by the IDTF must be specifically ordered in
> writing by the physician or practitioner who is treating the
> beneficiary, that is, the physician who is furnishing a consultation
> or treating a beneficiary for a specific medical problem and who uses
> the results in the management of the beneficiary\'s specific medical
> problem. (Nonphysician practitioners may order tests as set forth in
> CFR 410.32(a)(3).)
>
> The order must specify the diagnosis or other basis for the testing.
> The supervising physician for the IDTF may not order tests to be
> performed by the IDTF, unless the
>
> IDTF\'s supervising physician is in fact the beneficiary\'s treating
> physician. That is, the physician in question had a relationship with
> the beneficiary prior to the performance of the testing and is
> treating the beneficiary for a specific medical problem. The IDTF may
> not add any procedures based on internal protocols without a written
> order from the treating physician.

# - Diagnostic Tests Subject to the Anti-Markup Payment Limitation

#### *(Rev. 4473, Issued: 12-6-19; Effective: 3-9-20; Implementation: 3-9-20)*

> In most instances, physicians working for an IDTF do not order
> diagnostic tests because such tests are generally ordered by the
> patient's treating physician. If a physician working for an IDTF does
> not order a diagnostic test, the test is not subject to the anti-
> markup payment limitation. However, if a physician working for an IDTF
> (or a physician financially related to the IDTF through common
> ownership or control) orders a diagnostic test payable under the
> Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS), the anti- markup payment
> limitation may apply (depending on whether the performing physician or
> other supplier meets the "sharing a practice" requirements). For
> additional information, see Pub. 100-04, chapter 1, §30.2.9.
>
> If a physician working for an IDTF (or a physician financially related
> to the IDTF through common ownership or control) orders and the IDTF
> bills for a diagnostic test that is performed by another physician or
> supplier, the performing physician or other supplier must be enrolled
> in the Medicare program. No formal reassignment is necessary; however,
> reassigned diagnostic testing services may also be subject to the
> anti-markup payment limitation.
>
> The billing entity must report using the ASC X12 837 professional
> claim format or on the Form CMS-1500 the name, NPI, and address of the
> performing physician or other supplier. The acquisition price of the
> either the *technical component or professional component* of the
> diagnostic test must also be reported on the claim.
>
> Effective for claims with dates of service on or after January 25,
> 2005, A/B MACs *(Part B)* must accept and process claims for
> diagnostic tests subject to the anti-markup payment limitation billed
> by suppliers (including laboratories, physicians, and independent
> diagnostic testing facilities \[IDTFs\]) enrolled in the A/B MAC's
> *(Part B)* jurisdiction, for services furnished anywhere in the United
> States. For services furnished outside the A/B MAC *(Part B)*
> jurisdiction in which the billing entity is enrolled, the billing
> entity must submit its own NPI with the name, address, and ZIP code of
> the performing physician or other supplier in the appropriate data
> field. (The billing physician or other supplier should maintain a
> record of the performing physician or other supplier's NPI in the
> clinical record for auditing purposes.) Effective April 1, 2005, A/B
> MACs *(Part B)* must price claims for diagnostic tests that are
> subject to the anti-markup payment limitation based on the ZIP Code of
> the location where the service was rendered, using a CMS- supplied
> abstract file containing the HCPCS codes that are payable under the
> MPFS as an anti-markup test for the calendar year. *From April 1,
> 2005, through December 31, 2013, this was done using a CMS-supplied
> abstract file containing the HCPCS codes that are*
>
> *payable under the MPFS as an anti-markup test for the calendar year.
> Beginning January 1, 2014, A/B MACs (Part B) began using the Purchased
> Diagnostic Test Indicator for the HCPCS codes that are payable under
> the MPFS as an anti-markup test for the calendar year.* A/B MACs
> *(Part B)* must pay the lesser of: (a) the net acquisition price, (b)
> the billing entity's actual charge, or (c) the fee schedule amount as
> if the test was billed by the performing supplier.
>
> Effective for claims submitted with a receipt date on and after
> October 1, 2015, the billing physician or supplier must report the
> name, address, and NPI of the performing physician or supplier in Item
> 32a on anti-markup and reference laboratory claims, even if the
> performing physician or supplier is enrolled in a different A/B MAC
> *(Part B)* jurisdiction. See Pub. 100-04, Chapter 1, §10.1.1 for more
> information regarding claims filing jurisdiction.
>
> **NOTE:** As with all services payable under the MPFS, the ZIP Code is
> used to determine the appropriate payment locality and corresponding
> fee that is used to price the service that is subject to the
> anti-markup payment limitation. When a ZIP Code crosses county lines,
> CMS uses the dominant locality to determine the corresponding fee.

# - National Provider Identification (NPI) Reported on Claims

### (Rev. 2994; Issued: 07-25-14; Effective: 01-01-12; Implementation: 08-25-14)

> Effective for dates of service May 23, 2008 and later, IDTF's must
> submit the NPI assigned to the ordering physician using the ASC X12
> 837 professional claim format or, for paper claims, on the Form
> CMS-1500.

# 40 - Interpretations Performed Off the Premises of the IDTF

### (Rev. 1987, Issued: 06-11-10, Effective: 08-12-10, Implementation: 08-12-10)

> If an IDTF wants to bill for an interpretation performed by an
> independent practitioner off the premises of the IDTF, the IDTF must
> meet the conditions shown in IOM Pub. 100-04, Chapter 1, §30.2.9.

# 50 - Therapeutic Procedures

### (Rev. 1506; Issued: 05-16-08; Effective/Implementation Date: 06-16-08)

> An IDTF shall not be allowed to bill for any CPT or HCPCS codes that
> are [solely]{.underline} therapeutic.
