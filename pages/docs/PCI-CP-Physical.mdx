# Overview

## Scope

> The *PCI Card Production and Provisioning Physical Security
> Requirements and Test Procedures* manual is a comprehensive source of
> information for entities involved in card production and provisioning,
> which may include manufacturers, personalizers, pre-personalizers,
> chip embedders, data-preparation, and fulfillment.
>
> The contents of this manual specify the physical security requirements
> and procedures that entities must follow before, during, and after the
> processes listed below. Also included are the related test procedures
> by which Payment Brand Assessors will assess compliance.

> In addition to the card production activities above this document

-   Perform cloud-based or secure element (SE) provisioning services;

-   Manage over-the-air (OTA) personalization, lifecycle management, and
    > preparation of personalization data; or

-   Manage associated cryptographic keys.

> It does not apply to providers who are only performing the

## Laws and Regulations

> In addition to the physical security requirements contained in this
> document, there will almost certainly be relevant regional and
> national laws and regulations, including consumer protection acts,
> labor agreements, health and safety regulations, etc. It is the
> responsibility of each individual organization

> apply.

## Loss Prevention

> Vendors are responsible for preventing any unexplained product losses.
> Vendors are liable for any unexplained loss, theft, deterioration, or
> destruction of card products or components that may occur while such
> products are in the vendor's facility. Vendors are required to carry
> liability insurance covering all the risks stated above, taking into
> consideration the plant location, physical conditions and security of
> the plant, the number and duties of the card production staff, and the
> nature and volume of the contracted work.

## Limitations

> The individual Participating Payment Brands are responsible for
> defining and managing compliance programs associated with these

# Appendix C: Security Operations Center

> A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a permanent security
> configuration that controls Security Management Systems and maintains
> a high level of protection for buildings, assets, access, and staff.
> The SOC is optional and when implemented provides a centralized
> location to monitor, manage, and administer the CCTV, Access Control,
> and Alarm Systems for multiple facilities. A vendor may implement one
> or more SOCs such that each SOC provides security services for
> multiple (2 or more) facilities. When a SOC is present, it is located
> at a card production facility that is approved by the Vendor Program
> Administrator (VPA) for card production activities, and the SOC is
> expected to only monitor card production facilities that are either
> VPA-approved or are seeking VPA approval. These facilities are owned
> and operated by the card vendor who operates the SOC.
>
> When a SOC controls the security activities of multiple facilities, a
> local Security Control Room (SCR) is maintained at each facility for
> backup purposes in the event the SOC loses connectivity or otherwise
> becomes non-operational. Therefore, a local SCR is present at each
> facility managed by a SOC except for the facility at which the SOC is
> located where it is optional. The local SCR contains fully functional
> security control systems, but the day-to-day operations are performed
> by the SOC. Security guards that would normally perform SCR activities
> and other security functions that do not require a physical presence
> at the local facility may perform these activities from the SOC. When
> a SOC is temporarily not operational, local guards and predefined
> staff members at the affected facilities are expected to perform all
> tasks necessary to ensure continuous compliance with the security
> standard.
>
> The SOC security requirements in this section duplicate many of the
> requirements already contained in other sections of PCI Card
> Production and Provisioning Security Requirements. This is intentional
> as a SOC is only evaluated against the security requirements in
> Appendix C and the rest of the card production facility is assessed
> against the balance of the requirements. A card production facility
> that uses a SOC for security services is assessed for compliance with
> all physical and logical security requirements except where an
> exception is explicitly permitted for when a SOC is implemented. The
> SOC must be VPA-approved before becoming operational and is included
> in the scope of the annual assessment performed by a qualified CPSA.
