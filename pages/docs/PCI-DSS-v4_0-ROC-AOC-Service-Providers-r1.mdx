# Section 3 Validation and Attestation Details

> **This AOC is based on results noted in the ROC dated** *(Date of
> Report as noted in the ROC YYYY-MM-DD)*. Indicate below whether a full
> or partial PCI DSS assessment was completed:
>
> **Full Assessment** -- All requirements have been assessed and
> therefore no requirements were marked as Not Tested in the ROC.
>
> **Partial Assessment** -- One or more requirements have not been
> assessed and were therefore marked as Not Tested in the ROC. Any
> requirement not assessed is noted as Not Tested in Part 2g above.

> Based on the results documented in the ROC noted above, each signatory
> identified in any of Parts 3b-3d, as applicable, assert(s) the
