# PCI DSS v4.x: Items Noted for Improvement (INFI) Worksheet âˆ’ Frequently Asked Questions

> June 2023
>
> **Purpose of Document**
>
> The *PCI DSS v4.x: Items Noted for Improvement Worksheet* (INFI
> Worksheet) is intended for internal use between the assessor and the
> assessed entity to help entities better understand their security
> posture, improve their security processes and controls, and identify
> areas for improvement as they work towards security as a continuous
> process. The Worksheet also provides a useful method for entities to
> report items needing improvement and associated corrective actions to
> senior management. This document addresses questions around the use of
> the *PCI DSS v4.x INFI Worksheet.*

## *General Questions*

> **Q 1.1 What is the purpose of the *PCI DSS v4.x Items Noted for
> Improvement (INFI) Worksheet*?**
>
> ***A** To provide a consistent method for assessors to document
> corrective action and reassessment* activities during an assessment
> period, and to provide a consistent tool to facilitate related
> conversations between the assessor and the assessed entity.

### Q 1.2 Does this Worksheet need to be completed for PCI DSS v3.2.1 assessments?

> ***A** No, this Worksheet is intended for PCI DSS v4.x assessments.
> Completion of the INFI* Worksheet is recommended, but not required,
> for PCI DSS v3.2.1 assessments.

## *Assessor Responsibilities*

### Q 2.1 Are QSAs required to complete an INFI Worksheet for every PCI DSS v4.x assessment?

> ***A*** Yes.

### Q 2.2 Are QSAs required to complete an INFI Worksheet even if there are no Items Noted for Improvement?

> ***A** Yes, QSAs are required to complete the Assessor Acknowledgement
> and Attestation section* even if there are no items noted that needed
> improvement during the assessment, in which case the QSA will check
> the "No" box in that section.

### Q 2.3 Are ISAs completing a Report on Compliance for their organization required to complete an INFI Worksheet?

> ***A** ISAs are encouraged, but not required, to complete an INFI
> Worksheet.*

### Q 2.4 Can the QSA still sign the Attestation of Compliance (AOC) if an entity refuses to receive the INFI Worksheet?

> ***A** Yes, the QSA is still required to sign the AOC. The INFI
> worksheet is not considered a* compliance document, so whether the
> entity receives it does not affect the QSA's obligations to complete
> and sign the AOC. In this scenario, the QSA should also document in
> the workpapers that the entity refused to accept the INFI Worksheet.

### Q 2.5 Are QSAs required to complete INFI Worksheets when they assist entities with SAQs?

> ***A** No. If a QSA assists an entity in completing their SAQ, (for
> example, by testing requirements to* determine if they are met), the
> QSA's due diligence should include identification of any issues that
> need corrective action. It is recommended, but not required, that a
> QSA completes an INFI Worksheet to document any such issues noted as
> part of SAQ completion.

## *Use of the INFI Worksheet*

### Q 3.1 How should assessed entities use the INFI Worksheet?

> ***A** It is good practice for entities to maintain this document and
> share it internally with the* compliance and risk departments within
> their organization. Entities may also choose to share the Worksheet
> externally with assessors and other third parties, as it is an
> effective tool to allow future assessors and third parties to
> understand past challenges and how they were addressed.

### Q 3.2 Why does the INFI Worksheet include whether a control failure was first identified by the entity or the assessor?

> ***A** Entities with established processes to identify control
> failures and implement corrective actions* within their environments
> generally have more mature risk management and security processes,
> with information about whether those processes are operating
> effectively. While entities are not required to self-identify failures
> for use of an INFI worksheet, the INFI worksheet does include a
> section to identify whether the failure was first identified by the
> entity or the assessor. Including whether the control failure was
> identified by the entity or the assessor is intended to help entities
> understand whether they are effectively maintaining and monitoring
> their controls and environment.

### Q 3.3 What is the role of INFI for requirements with a periodic or defined frequency, where an entity did not perform the activity within the required timeframe?

> ***A** Several PCI DSS requirements specify that a security activity
> is to be performed periodically or* at a defined frequency. If an
> entity fails to perform the control on one or more of the defined
> timeframes, there is no way for them to perform the control
> retroactively or backdate a later occurrence of the control to an
> earlier period.
>
> *A common example is external ASV scans, which are required at least
> once every three months.* If an ASV scan was not performed for six
> months, the entity will not have sufficient ASV scan reports to
> provide as evidence during the assessment. Other examples include not
> installing a critical security patch within 30 days of release and not
> reviewing network security control configurations at least once every
> six months.
>
> *In these scenarios, the assessor can use the INFI Worksheet to
> support a finding of "In Place" if* the entity has implemented
> corrective actions and successfully performed the control in
> accordance with the requirement, and the assessor has assurance that:

-   *The entity has a repeatable and documented process for performing
    the control,*

-   *The entity demonstrates that the activity was missed due to an
    exceptional circumstance (poor security practices and recurring
    failures are not an "exceptional circumstance"),*

-   *The entity shows that they have addressed the issue that led to the
    exception, and*

-   *The entity has included steps in their process to prevent
    recurrence.*

> *If the entity cannot demonstrate the above, or the assessor does not
> have assurance that the* entity has processes in place to meet the
> requirement, the assessor can consider whether a "Not in Place"
> finding would be the appropriate result.

### Q 3.4 What should a QSA do if they observe the same item is noted for improvement during the next assessment?

> ***A** The intent of the INFI Worksheet is to help entities better
> understand their security posture,* improve their security processes
> and controls, and identify areas for improvement as they work towards
> security as a continuous process. The entity is expected to address
> items noted for improvement, including implementing processes to
> prevent recurrence. However, it is not intended to be an automatic
> "Not in Place" finding if that same item is noted for improvement
> during the next PCI DSS assessment.
>
> *The assessor has discretion when deciding how to report repeated
> items noted for improvement,* considering the following:

-   *Were the processes previously implemented by the entity to prevent
    > recurrence of the item ineffective or not followed?*

-   *Were the circumstances or reasons for the current failure different
    > than for the previous failure (for example, the failure happened
    > in a different part of the company or a different set of systems
    > that fall under separate processes, or the failure happened for a
    > completely different reason)?*

> *If the assessor sees a recurring theme and determines that the
> current failure resulted from a* failure of the processes previously
> developed by the entity to prevent recurrence, a "Not in Place" result
> may be the appropriate finding.

### Q 3.5 Does use of the INFI Worksheet apply to all PCI DSS requirements?

> ***A** Yes. Use of the INFI Worksheet applies to all PCI DSS
> requirements, including scenarios where:*

-   *The assessor is validating that a control has been performed
    > periodically or at a defined frequency.*

-   *The assessor is validating that a control is in place at a single
    > point in time.*
