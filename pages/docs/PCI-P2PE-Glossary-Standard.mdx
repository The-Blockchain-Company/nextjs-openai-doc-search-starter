| >                  | Process of verifying the identity of an         |
| **Authentication** | individual, device, or process. Authentication  |
|                    | typically occurs through the use of one or more |
|                    | authentication factors such as:                 |
|                    |                                                 |
|                    | -   Something you know, such as a password or   |
|                    |     > passphrase                                |

|                    | -   Something you have, such as a token device  |
|                    |     > or smart card                             |

|                    | -   Something you are, such as a biometric      |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| > **Authentication | Combination of the user ID or account ID plus   |
| > credentials**    | the authentication factor(s) used to            |
|                    | authenticate an individual, device, or process. |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| >                  | **In the context of access control,**           |
|  **Authorization** | authorization is the granting of access or      |
|                    | other rights to a user, program, or process.    |
|                    | Authorization defines what an individual or     |
|                    | program can do after successful authentication. |
|                    |                                                 |
|                    | **In the context of a payment card              |
|                    | transaction,** authorization occurs when a      |
|                    | merchant receives transaction approval after    |
|                    | the acquirer validates the transaction with the |
|                    | issuer/processor.                               |

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| > **Bit strength** | The effective cryptographic strength measured   |
|                    | in bits representing what the equivalent key    |
|                    | length would be of a provably secure,           |
|                    | hypothetical, symmetric key algorithm. Bit      |
|                    | strength is never greater than the actual key   |
|                    | length, and as cryptanalytic attacks improve    |
|                    | and computational capabilities advance,         |
|                    | effective cryptographic strength decreases      |
|                    | (i.e., bit strength values will be reassessed   |
|                    | periodically to reflect these changes).         |

| > **Check value**  | A computed value that is the result of passing  |
|                    | a data value through a non-reversible           |
|                    | algorithm. Check values generally are           |
|                    | calculated using a cryptographic                |
|                    | transformation, which accepts as input a secret |
|                    | key and an arbitrary string, then gives a       |
|                    | cryptographic check value as output. The        |
|                    | computation of a correct check value without    |
|                    | knowledge of the secret key shall not be        |

|                    | substitution, or use of sensitive data          |
|                    | (including clear-text cryptographic keys and    |

|                    | With asymmetric cryptographic techniques, there |
|                    | are four elementary transformations: sign and   |
|                    | verify for signature systems, and encrypt and   |
|                    | decrypt for encryption systems. The signature   |
|                    | and the decryption transformation are kept      |
|                    | private by the owning entity, whereas the       |
|                    | corresponding verification and encryption       |
|                    | transformations are published.                  |

|                    | There exist asymmetric cryptosystems (for       |
|                    | example, RSA) where the four elementary         |
|                    | functions may be achieved by only two           |
|                    | transformations: one private transformation     |
|                    | suffices for both signing and decrypting        |
|                    | messages, and one public transformation         |
|                    | suffices for both verifying and encrypting      |
|                    | messages. However, this does not conform to the |
|                    | principle of key separation, and where used,    |
|                    | the four elementary transformations and the     |
|                    | corresponding keys should be kept separate.     |
