## Updates to Documents and Security Requirements

> It is necessary to regularly review, update, and improve the security
> requirements and testing procedures used to evaluate P2PE Products.
> PCI SSC provides interim updates to the PCI community through a
> variety of means including required training, e-mail bulletins,
> frequently asked questions (which may include technical/normative
> FAQs), and others.
>
> PCI SSC reserves the right to change, amend, or withdraw security
> requirements or testing procedures at any time. If such a change is
> required, PCI SSC will endeavor to work closely with PCI SSC's
> community of Participating Organizations, P2PE Solution Providers,
> P2PE Component Providers, P2PE Application Vendors, and P2PE Assessor
> Companies to help minimize the impact of any changes.

# Roles and Responsibilities

> This section provides an overview of the roles and responsibilities of
> the various P2PE stakeholder groups.

## P2PE Vendors

> P2PE Vendors (P2PE Solution Providers, P2PE Component Providers, and
> P2PE Application Vendors) seeking Acceptance as part of the Program:
>
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} Provide access to their P2PE Products
> and supporting documentation to a P2PE Assessor Company for
> validation, and
>
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} Authorize the P2PE Assessor Company to
> submit resulting P-ROVs and related information to PCI SSC.

##### *P2PE Solution Providers*

> P2PE Solution Providers are entities (for example, processors,
> acquirers, or payment gateways) that:
>
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} Have overall responsibility for the
> design and implementation of specific P2PE Solutions, and
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} Directly manage P2PE Solutions for
> their customers and/or manage corresponding
>
> responsibilities.
>
> A P-ROV using the required P-ROV template specifically for P2PE
> Solutions (a "Solution P- ROV"), in addition to any applicable P2PE
> Component P-ROV(s) and/or P2PE Application P- ROV(s), must be
> submitted to PCI SSC for each P2PE Solution to be validated (except
> for Merchant-Managed P2PE Solutions, which are not Listed by PCI SSC).
> Refer to Table 6.1, "P- ROVs to be used for P2PE v3 Assessments".

##### *P2PE Application (Software) Vendors*

> To comply with the P2PE Standard, an application vendor that develops
> applications with access to clear-text account data on a PCI-approved
> POI device (i.e., P2PE Applications) must:
>
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} Have those applications assessed
> against the P2PE Standard for secure operation within the applicable
> PCI-approved POI device(s), and
>
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} Provide corresponding Implementation
> Guides that describe the secure installation and administration of
> such applications on the corresponding PCI-approved POI devices.
>
> A P2PE Application may be assessed as part of an overall P2PE Solution
> or may optionally be validated and Accepted as a standalone, Validated
> P2PE Application, and Listed on the List of Validated P2PE
> Applications*.* Assessment of P2PE Applications for P2PE Program
> purposes must be performed by a PA-QSA (P2PE) Company.
>
> For P2PE Applications intended for use in multiple P2PE Solutions or
> applicable P2PE Components, validation and Acceptance as a Validated
> P2PE Application eliminates the need for the application to be
> separately assessed for P2PE Program purposes as part of each P2PE
> Solution or P2PE Component in which it is used.
>
> A P2PE Application P-ROV (refer to Table 6.1 below) must be submitted
> to PCI SSC for each P2PE Application assessed as part of the Program.

##### *P2PE Component Providers*

> P2PE Component Providers are entities that provide one or more
> services that:

(a) Require a P2PE Assessment for Program purposes, and

(b) Are performed on behalf of a P2PE Solution Provider or a P2PE
    > Component Provider for use in P2PE Solutions. These services (and
    > their respective P2PE Component Providers) include the following
    > (each as described further below):

> Only P2PE Components (i.e., component services) that have been
> validated by a P2PE Assessor and Accepted on an "Individual basis" by
> PCI SSC are separately Listed on the Website.
>
> "Individual basis" here refers to the requirements for each component
> service's individual PCI SSC submission in the Portal---including the
> corresponding P-AOV, P-ROV, and applicable fees---for each individual
> component service.
>
> Each P2PE Component requires its own PCI SSC submission. A separate
> P-ROV must be submitted to PCI SSC for each P2PE Component assessed as
> part of the Program for it to be Accepted and Listed. If a P2PE
> Component service described above is assessed as part of a P2PE
> Solution (or a P2PE Component, as applicable) but is not on the List
> of Validated P2PE Components, the entity providing that component
> service is not considered a P2PE Component Provider for purposes of
> that component service and is considered a Third-Party Service
> Provider with respect to that component service. A Third-Party Service
> Provider must have its services reviewed during the course of each of
> its P2PE Solution Provider (or P2PE Component Provider) customers'
> P2PE Assessments.
>
> P2PE Components may, in turn, use Validated P2PE Components or
> component services provided by Third-Party Service Providers.

##### *Use of Third-Party Service Providers*

> A P2PE Solution Provider (or a merchant acting as its own P2PE
> Solution Provider in the case of a Merchant-Managed Solution) or P2PE
> Component Provider may choose to manage their P2PE Solution or P2PE
> Component, respectively, without using any Third-Party Service
> Providers.
>
> However, a P2PE Solution Provider (or a merchant acting as its own
> P2PE Solution Provider in the case of a Merchant-Managed Solution) or
> P2PE Component Provider may choose to outsource certain services that
> are part of the applicable P2PE Solution or P2PE Component to
> Third-Party Service Providers who perform these functions on behalf of
> the P2PE Solution Provider or the P2PE Component Provider.
>
> All P2PE services and functions performed by Third-Party Service
> Providers on behalf of a P2PE Solution Provider or P2PE Component
> Provider must be validated per applicable P2PE Solution or P2PE
> Component requirements, and Third-Party Service Providers have the
> option of having their P2PE Component services validated under the
> Program.
>
> There are two validation options for third-party entities performing
> P2PE functions on behalf of P2PE Solution Providers or P2PE Component
> Providers:

1)  Undergo a P2PE Assessment of the applicable P2PE Component services
    > or functions against relevant P2PE Requirements and have their
    > P2PE Assessor submit the applicable P2PE Report of Validation
    > (P-ROV) to PCI SSC for review and Acceptance. Upon Acceptance, the
    > corresponding P2PE Component is Listed on PCI SSC's List of
    > Validated P2PE Components.

> Or,

2)  Have their P2PE Component functions or services reviewed during and
    > as part of each of their customers' corresponding P2PE
    > Assessments.

> Accordingly, a P2PE Solution or P2PE Component can be reviewed via the
> following scenarios:

1)  A P2PE Solution Provider or P2PE Component Provider (or a merchant
    > as a P2PE Solution Provider in the case of a Merchant-Managed
    > Solution (MMS)) can outsource functions and have them assessed as
    > part of the overall P2PE Assessment of that P2PE Solution or P2PE
    > Component.

> and/or,

2)  A P2PE Solution Provider or P2PE Component Provider (or a merchant
    > as a P2PE Solution Provider in the case of a MMS) can outsource
    > certain P2PE Component service functions to Listed P2PE Component
    > Providers and report use of those PCI-Listed P2PE Component(s) in
    > its P2PE Solution P-ROV or applicable P2PE Component P-ROV.

> P2PE Solution Providers (or merchants as P2PE Solution Providers in
> the case of a MMS) and P2PE Component Providers must manage the
> overall P2PE Solution or P2PE Component, respectively, and any
> third-party services (and corresponding Third-Party Service Providers)
> used to perform P2PE Component services or functions on their behalf,
> whether those Third-Party Service Providers are separately Listed by
> PCI SSC as P2PE Component Providers or are assessed as part of the
> P2PE Assessment of the corresponding P2PE Solution or P2PE Component.

## PCI-recognized Laboratories

> Security laboratories qualified by PCI SSC under the PCI SSC
> laboratory program ("PCI-recognized Laboratories") are responsible for
> the evaluation of POI devices and HSMs against PCI SSC's PTS Standards
> ("PTS requirements"). Evaluation reports on devices found compliant
> with the PTS requirements are submitted by the PCI-recognized
> Laboratories to PCI SSC for approval; and if approved, the device is
> listed on PCI SSC's \"List of Approved PTS Devices\" on the Website.

## Payment Device (Hardware) Vendors

> A POI device vendor submits a POI device for evaluation to a
> PCI-recognized Laboratory. Only eligible POI devices listed on the
> List of Approved PTS Devices may be used as part of a P2PE Solution.

3.  # Overview of Validation Processes

    1.  ## Validation Processes for P2PE Products to be Listed on the Website

> The P2PE Assessment process is initiated by the P2PE Vendor. The
> Website has all the associated documents needed to navigate the P2PE
> Assessment process. The following is a high-level overview of the
> process.

1)  The P2PE Vendor selects a P2PE Assessor Company from PCI SSC's List
    of P2PE Qualified Security Assessor Companies and negotiates the
    cost and any associated P2PE Assessor Company confidentiality and
    non-disclosure agreements with the P2PE Assessor Company.

2)  The P2PE Vendor then provides to the P2PE Assessor Company its
    executed VRA and access to the applicable P2PE Solution, P2PE
    Component(s), and/or P2PE Application(s) to be assessed, POI device
    types, corresponding *Implementation Guides* for P2PE Applications*,
    P2PE Instruction Manual* for P2PE Solutions, and all associated
    manuals and other required documentation.

3)  Refer to Section 2.1.4, "Use of Third-Party Service Providers," in
    this document to understand options for validating P2PE Component
    functions and services provided by Third-Party Service Providers.
    The P2PE Assessor Company then assesses the P2PE Solution, P2PE
    Component(s), and/or P2PE Application(s), including its security
    functions and features, using the appropriate P-ROV(s), to determine
    whether it complies with the P2PE Standard.

4)  If the P2PE Assessor Company determines that the P2PE Solution, P2PE
    Component(s), and/or P2PE Application is in compliance with the P2PE
    Standard, the P2PE Assessor Company submits the corresponding
    P-ROV(s) to PCI SSC, attesting to compliance and setting forth the
    results, opinions, and conclusions of the P2PE Assessor Company on
    all test procedures along with the P2PE Vendor's signed VRA and the
    corresponding P-AOV. Refer to Appendix A, "P2PE Products and
    Acceptance," for more details on Acceptance.

5)  PCI SSC issues an invoice to the P2PE Vendor for the applicable P2PE
    Acceptance Fee. After the P2PE Vendor has paid the invoice, PCI SSC
    reviews the submission to confirm that it meets the P2PE Program
    requirements and if confirmed, PCI SSC notifies the P2PE Assessor
    Company and P2PE Vendor that the P2PE Solution, P2PE Component(s),
    and/or P2PE Application(s) have completed the process.

6)  Once the above process is complete for the submitted P2PE Solution,
    P2PE Component(s), and/or P2PE Application(s), PCI SSC signs the
    corresponding P-AOV and adds the P2PE Solution, P2PE Component(s),
    and/or P2PE Application(s) to the corresponding List of Validated
    P2PE Products on the Website.

## Overview of Validation Processes for Merchant-Managed P2PE Solutions

> The P2PE Assessment process for P2PE Solutions that are managed by the
> merchant that uses that P2PE Solution (each a "Merchant-Managed P2PE
> Solution" or "MMS") is initiated by the applicable merchant. The
> Website has all the associated documents needed to navigate the

2)  The Merchant provides the P2PE Assessor Company access to the MMS to
    be assessed, PCI- approved POI Device Types, corresponding
    *Implementation Guides* for P2PE Applications*, P2PE Instruction
    Manual* for MMS, and all associated manuals and other required
    documentation.

3)  The P2PE Assessor Company assesses the MMS, including its security
    functions and features, to determine whether the MMS complies with
    the P2PE Standard.

4)  If the P2PE Assessor Company determines that the MMS is in
    compliance with the P2PE Standard, the P2PE Assessor Company
    prepares and submits to the Merchant a corresponding P2PE
    Merchant-Managed Solution P-ROV attesting to compliance and setting
    forth the results, opinions and conclusions of the P2PE Assessor
    Company on all test procedures.

## Prior to the Review

> Prior to commencing a P2PE Assessment with a P2PE Assessor Company,
> all parties involved are encouraged to take the following preparatory
> actions:

## Required Documentation

> The P2PE Vendor must deliver all completed P2PE Assessment-related
> materials (such as, but not limited to, P-ROVs, manuals, the *P2PE
> Instruction Manual*, *P2PE Application Implementation Guide*, the
> *Vendor Release Agreement,* and all other materials related to the
> P2PE Assessment and participation in the P2PE Program) to the P2PE
> Assessor Company performing the P2PE Assessment, not to PCI SSC.

## P2PE Review Timeframes

> The amount of time necessary for a P2PE Assessor to complete their
> P2PE Assessment can vary widely depending on factors such as:
>
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"

>
> Any P2PE Assessment timeframes provided by a P2PE Assessor Company
> should be considered estimates, since they may be based on the
> assumption that the P2PE Product is able to successfully meet all P2PE
> Requirements quickly. If problems are found during review or
> Acceptance processes, discussions between the P2PE Assessor Company,
> the P2PE Vendor, and/or PCI SSC may be required. Such discussions may
> significantly impact review times and cause delays and/or may even
> cause the review to end prematurely (for example, if the P2PE Vendor
> decides it does not want to make the necessary changes to achieve
> compliance).

## P2PE Assessors

> PCI SSC qualifies and provides required training for P2PE Assessor
> Companies (QSA (P2PE) and PA- QSA (P2PE)) to assess and validate P2PE
> Products to the P2PE Standard. In order to perform P2PE Solution
> Assessments and/or P2PE Component Assessments, a P2PE Assessor Company
> must have been qualified by PCI SSC and remain in Good Standing (as
> defined in the *QSA Qualification Requirements* and *P2PE
> Qualification Requirements*, as applicable) or in remediation as both
> a QSA Company and QSA (P2PE) Company. In order to perform P2PE
> Application Assessments, a P2PE Assessor Company must have been
> additionally qualified by PCI SSC and remain in Good Standing (as
> defined in the *QSA Qualification Requirements* and *P2PE
> Qualification Requirements*, as applicable) or in remediation as both
> a PA-QSA Company and PA-QSA (P2PE) Company. All recognized P2PE
> Assessor Companies are listed on the Website. These are the only
> assessors recognized by PCI SSC as qualified to perform P2PE
> Assessments.
>
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} For each P2PE Assessment, the resulting
> P2PE Assessor report must follow the P2PE Report on Validation (P-ROV)
> template and instructions, as outlined in the corresponding *P-ROV
> Reporting Template.* Refer to Table 6.1, "P-ROVs to be used for P2PE
> v3 Assessments."
>
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"

> height="0.1527777777777778in"} Each P2PE Product (including all
> applicable P-ROVs) submitted to PCI SSC for Acceptance and Listing
> must be accompanied by a corresponding P2PE Attestation on Validation
> (P-AOV) in the form available through the Website, signed by a duly
> authorized officer of the P2PE Assessor Company, that summarizes
> whether the entity is in compliance or is not in compliance with the
> P2PE Standard and any related findings, as well as the *P2PE
> Application Implementation Guide* (as applicable) and *P2PE
> Instruction Manual.*

##### *P2PE Assessor Company Fees*

> The prices and fees charged by P2PE Assessor Companies are not set by
> PCI SSC. These fees are negotiated between the P2PE Assessor Company
> and the P2PE Vendor. Before deciding on a P2PE Assessor Company, it is
> recommended that a prospective P2PE Vendor check the list of P2PE
> Qualified Assessor Companies on the Website, talk to several P2PE
> Assessor Companies, and follow its own vendor-selection processes.

## Technical Support throughout Testing

> It is recommended that the P2PE Vendor (or in the case of a
> Merchant-Managed P2PE Solution, the Merchant) make available a
> technical resource person to assist with any questions that may arise
> during the P2PE Assessment. During the review, and to expedite the
> process, a technical contact should be on call to discuss issues and
> respond to questions from the P2PE Assessor Company.

### *Vendor Release Agreement* (VRA)

> For any P2PE Product P-ROV(s) to be reviewed by PCI SSC, PCI SSC must
> have on file the P2PE Vendor's signed copy of the then-current version
> of the *Vendor Release Agreement* available on the Website. Generally,
> the P2PE Vendor provides its signed VRA to the P2PE Assessor Company
> along with access to the P2PE Product and other documents and
> materials, at the beginning of the applicable P2PE Assessment process.
>
> Among other things, the VRA:
>
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} Covers confidentiality issues;

> height="0.1527777777777778in"} Covers the P2PE Vendor's agreement to
> P2PE Program requirements, policies and procedures;
>
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} Gives permission to the P2PE Vendor's
> P2PE Assessor Company to release P-ROVs and related materials to PCI
> SSC for review; and
>
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} Requires P2PE Vendors to adopt and
> comply with industry standard Vulnerability Handling Policies.
>
> For PCI SSC to review a P-ROV, PCI SSC must receive from the P2PE
> Assessor Company (or already have on file) the P2PE Vendor's signed
> copy of then-current VRA. At the time of submission of any
>
> P-ROV to PCI SSC:
>
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} If PCI SSC **does not** already have
> the P2PE Vendor's signed copy of the then-current VRA, the P2PE
> Assessor Company must provide the P2PE Vendor's signed copy of the
> then-current VRA to PCI SSC, along with the P-ROV(s) submission.

> P2PE Vendor's signed copy of the then-current VRA, the P2PE Assessor
> is not required to re-submit the same VRA to PCI SSC at that time.

## The Portal

> For any P2PE Product to be Listed on the Website, all documents
> relating to the P2PE validation process for that P2PE Product are to
> be submitted by the applicable P2PE Assessor, on behalf of the P2PE
> Vendor, to PCI SSC through the PCI SSC's secure website ("Portal").
> Submissions are pre- screened in the Portal by Council staff to help
> ensure that all required documentation has been included and the basic
> submission requirements have been satisfied.
>
> The Portal is also used by PCI SSC to track all communications
> relating to a submission.

+========================================+=============================+
+----------------------------------------+-----------------------------+

> There are no annual recurring PCI SSC fees associated with the
> Acceptance of a P2PE Product. There are, however, PCI SSC fees
> associated with P2PE Vendor delays in annual revalidation of Validated

5.  # Annual Revalidation and Change

    1.  ## Annual Revalidation of P2PE Products

> Annually, based on the date of the applicable P2PE Product's
> Acceptance, the P2PE Vendor is required to submit an updated *P2PE
> Attestation of Validation (P-AOV)* for that P2PE Product, covering the
> time since the last submission for that P2PE Product (i.e., initial
> P-ROV(s) submission or annual update per this Section) was Accepted
> and Listed by PCI SSC (each an "Annual Revalidation").
>
> PCI SSC will generally send a courtesy reminder e-mail to the P2PE
> Vendor's contact (as identified in the applicable P-AOV) within 90
> days prior to the relevant Annual Revalidation/Reassessment date, but
> it is the sole responsibility of the P2PE Vendor to maintain the
> listing regardless of any such courtesy reminder(s).
>
> As part of this annual process, P2PE Vendors are required to confirm
> whether any changes have been made to the P2PE Product, and that:

a)  Changes have been applied in a way that is consistent with the P2PE
    Standard;

b)  The P2PE Product continues to meet the requirements of the P2PE
    Standard;

c)  POI devices or HSMs that are part of the P2PE Product

> continue to be acceptable for use in a P2PE Product. Refer to Table
> 4.1, "Program Guidance," for SCDs regarding expired POI devices and
> HSMs.

d)  PCI SSC has been advised of any change that necessitates a change to
    the listing on the Website, in accordance with the P2PE Program
    Guide.

> The P2PE Vendor is required to give consideration to the impact of
> external threats and whether updates to the P2PE Product are necessary
> to address changes to the external threat environment. The updated
> P-AOV should be submitted via e-mail to the PCI SSC P2PE Program
> Manager. If an updated P-AOV is not submitted and Accepted by PCI SSC
> on or before the P2PE Product's current Annual Revalidation Date, the
> P2PE Product will be subject to early administrative expiry, as
> follows:

> Program), it becomes an Expired P2PE Product, is no longer considered
> a Validated P2PE Product, and will be moved to the P2PE Expired
> Listings.
>
> PCI SSC will, following receipt of the updated *P2PE Attestation of
> Validation*: (i) review the submission for completeness; and (ii) if
> completeness is established, sign and return a copy of the updated
> *P2PE Attestation of Validation* to the P2PE Vendor.

## Changes to P2PE Products

> P2PE Vendors may update Listed P2PE Products for various reasons.
> Multiple Change Types are provided for Listed P2PE Products depending
> on the type of change being made. The following Change Types do not
> have any impact on Annual Revalidation dates or Reassessment dates of

6.  # P2PE Assessor Reporting Considerations

    1.  ## P-ROV Acceptance Process Overview

> The P2PE Standard makes use of different P-ROV templates for P2PE
> Solutions, P2PE Applications, and P2PE Component types. There is a
> single Solution P-ROV, in addition to separate P-ROVs based on a P2PE
> Component or P2PE Application function (or service offering) as it
> pertains to a P2PE Solution. Each of the separate P-ROVs is used in
> addition to the Solution P-ROV for P2PE Assessments of P2PE Solutions,
> as needed. They are also used for individual P2PE Assessments of P2PE
> Components or P2PE Applications. Refer to Table 6.1, "P-ROVs to be
> used for P2PE v3 Assessments," below.

##### *P2PE Solution Assessments*

> P2PE Assessments of P2PE Solutions must use, at a minimum, the
> Solution P-ROV template. For every function that is not outsourced to
> a PCI SSC-listed P2PE Component Provider, EACH applicable P2PE
> Component P-ROV must be completed and submitted in addition to the
> Solution P-ROV.

##### *P2PE Component Assessments*

> P2PE Assessments of P2PE Components must use the P-ROV template
> associated with the applicable service offering. Refer to Table 6.1,
> "P-ROVs to be used for P2PE v3 Assessments," for the description of
> appropriate P-ROV(s).

##### *P2PE Application Assessments*

> P2PE Assessments of P2PE Applications must use the P-ROV template
> specified for P2PE Applications.

##### *P-ROV Submission Process*

> When the P-ROV(s) have all items in place, and where the P2PE Vendor
> seeks to have the P2PE Product Listed on the Website, the P2PE
> Assessor Company performs a quality assurance review and then submits
> the P-ROV(s) and all other required materials to PCI SSC. If the P-
> ROV(s) do not have all items in place, the P2PE Vendor must address
> those items, and the P2PE Assessor must update the P-ROV(s) prior to
> submission to PCI SSC. Once the P2PE Assessor Company is satisfied
> that all documented issues have been resolved by the P2PE Vendor, the
> P2PE Assessor Company submits the P-ROV(s) and all other required
> materials to PCI SSC.
>
> Once PCI SSC receives the completed P-ROV(s) and all other required
> materials and applicable fees, PCI SSC reviews the submission from a
> quality-assurance perspective and determines whether it is acceptable.
> Subsequent iterations will also be responded to, typically within 30
> calendar days of receipt. If the P-ROV(s) meet all applicable quality
> assurance requirements (as documented in the *QSA Qualification
> Requirements* and related P2PE Program materials), PCI SSC sends a
> countersigned P-AOV to both the P2PE Vendor and the P2PE Assessor
> Company and adds the product to the List of Validated P2PE Solutions,
> List of Validated P2PE Components, or List of Validated P2PE
> Applications, as applicable.
>
> PCI SSC communicates any quality issues associated with P-ROVs to the
> P2PE Assessor Company. It is the responsibility of the P2PE Assessor
> Company to resolve those issues with PCI SSC and/or the P2PE Vendor,
> as applicable. Such issues may be limited or more extensive:
>
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} Limited issues may simply require
> updating the P-ROV(s) to reflect adequate documentation to support the
> P2PE Assessor Company's decisions; whereas
>
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} More extensive issues may require the
> P2PE Assessor Company to perform further testing, requiring the P2PE
> Assessor Company to notify the P2PE Vendor that re-testing is needed
> and to schedule that testing with the P2PE Vendor.
>
> P-ROV(s) that have been returned to the P2PE Assessor Company for
> correction must be resubmitted to the PCI SSC within 30 days of the
> preceding submission. If this is not possible, the P2PE Assessor
> Company must inform the PCI SSC of the timeline for response. Lack of
> response on P-ROV(s) returned to the P2PE Assessor Company for
> correction may result in the submission being closed. Submissions that
> have been closed will not be reopened and must be resubmitted as if
> they are new P-ROV submissions.

## Delivery of the P-ROV and Related Materials

> For P2PE Products to be Listed on the Website, all documents required
> in connection with the P2PE validation process must be submitted to
> PCI SSC by the P2PE Assessor Company, through the Portal. PCI SSC
> staff pre-screen Portal submissions to ensure that all required
> documentation has been included and the basic submission requirements
> have been satisfied.
>
> There must be consistency between the information in documents
> submitted for review via the Portal and the "Details" fields within
> the Portal. Common errors in submissions include inconsistent
> application names or contact information and incomplete or
> inconsistent documentation. Incomplete or inconsistent submissions may
> result in a significant delay in the processing of requests for
> listing and/or may be rejected by PCI SSC.

##### *Access to the Portal*

> Once a P2PE Assessor Company has had its first employee successfully
> complete the individual P2PE Assessor qualification process, PCI SSC
> will send login credentials and instructions for use of the Portal to
> the company's Primary Contact. Additional credentials can be requested
> by each company's Primary Contact through the PCI SSC P2PE Program
> Manager. Portal credentials may be issued to any employee of a P2PE
> Assessor Company and are not limited to P2PE Assessor Employees.

##### *Resubmissions*

> For subsequent reviews, if multiple iterations of a P-ROV(s) are
> required before PCI SSC accepts the report, the P2PE Assessor must
> submit P-ROV(s) versions that include tracking of cumulative changes
> within the document.

## Assessor Quality Management Program

> As stated in the *P2PE Qualification Requirements* and the *P2PE
> Assessor Addendum*, P2PE Assessors are required to meet all quality
> assurance standards set by PCI SSC. The various phases of the assessor
> quality management program are described below.

##### *P-ROV Submission Review*

> PCI SSC's Assessor Quality Management Team ("AQM") reviews each P-ROV
> submission after the invoice for the P2PE Acceptance Fee has been paid
> by the P2PE Vendor. Administrative review will be performed in
> "pre-screening" to ensure that the submission is complete prior to AQM
> review, during which an AQM Analyst reviews the submission in its
> entirety.
>
> The AQM Analyst will review the P2PE submission first to determine
> whether the candidate P2PE Product is eligible for validation as
> described in the *P2PE Program Guide*. If there are questions as to
> eligibility, the AQM Analyst will contact the P2PE Assessor Company
> for additional information. If the P2PE submission is determined to be
> ineligible for validation under the P2PE Program, the P-ROV submission
> will be rejected. The P2PE Assessor Company will receive a letter of
> rejection with instructions for optionally appealing.
>
> If the P2PE submission is complete and is determined to be eligible
> for validation under the P2PE Program, the AQM Analyst will conduct a
> complete review of the P-ROV submission and supporting documentation
> provided or subsequently requested by PCI SSC. Any comments or
> feedback from the AQM Analyst will be made via the Portal, and the
> P2PE Assessor Company must address all inquiries and feedback in a
> timely manner. The AQM Analyst's role is to ensure sufficient evidence
> is included to provide reasonable assurance that the P2PE Assessment
> was performed in accordance with Program requirements and meets
> quality standards.

##### *P2PE Assessor Quality Audit*

> The purpose of the P2PE Assessor Company audit process is to provide
> reasonable assurance that the assessment of P2PE Solutions, P2PE
> Components, and P2PE Applications and overall quality of report
> submissions remain at a level that is consistent with the objectives
> of the *P2PE Program Guide* and supporting PCI SSC documentation.
>
> As QSA Company audits are described in the *QSA Qualification
> Requirements*, P2PE Assessor Companies are also subject to audits of
> their work as P2PE Assessor Companies under the *QSA Qualification
> Requirements* at any time. This may include but is not limited to
> review of completed reports, work papers, and onsite visits with P2PE
> Assessor Companies to audit internal QA programs, at the expense of
> the P2PE Assessor Company. Refer to the *QSA Qualification
> Requirements* for information on PCI SSC's audit process.

##### *P2PE Assessor Company Status*

> The P2PE Program recognizes several status designations for P2PE
> Assessor Companies: "In Good Standing," "Remediation," and
> "Revocation." The status of a P2PE Assessor Company is initially "In
> Good Standing" but may change based on quality concerns, feedback from
> clients and/or Participating Payment Brands, administrative issues or
> other factors. These status designations are described further below.

####### In Good Standing

> P2PE Assessor Companies are expected to maintain a status of "In Good
> Standing" while participating in the P2PE Program. Reviews of each
> submission and the overall quality of submissions are conducted by PCI
> SSC to detect any deterioration of quality levels over time. P2PE
> Assessor Companies are also subject to periodic audit by PCI SSC at
> any time.

####### Remediation

> A P2PE Assessor Company and/or P2PE Assessor Employee may be placed
> into Remediation for various reasons, including quality concerns or
> administrative issues---such as failure to meet any requalification
> requirement, failure to submit required information in a timely
> manner, etc. P2PE Assessor Companies in Remediation are identified on
> the Website in **Red**, indicating their remediation status without
> further explanation of the designation.
>
> If administrative or minor quality problems are detected, PCI SSC will
> typically recommend participation in Remediation. Remediation provides
> an opportunity for P2PE Assessor Companies and/or Employees to improve
> performance by working closely with PCI SSC staff; in the absence of
> participation, quality issues may persist or increase. Additionally,
> Remediation helps to assure that the baseline standard of quality for
> P2PE Assessor Companies and/or Employees is upheld. Refer to the *QSA
> Qualification Requirements* for further detail on the Remediation
> Process.

####### Revocation

> Serious quality concerns may result in revocation of P2PE Assessor
> Company and/or P2PE Assessor Employee qualification and/or termination
> of the P2PE Assessor Addendum. When a P2PE Assessor Company and/or
> P2PE Assessor Employee qualification is revoked, the assessor is
> removed from the List of approved P2PE Assessors and is no longer
> eligible to perform P2PE Assessments, process P-ROVs or otherwise
> participate in the P2PE Program; provided that if and to the extent
> approved by PCI SSC in writing, the P2PE Assessor will be required to
> complete any P2PE Assessments for which it was engaged prior to the
> effective date of the Revocation.
>
> The P2PE Assessor Company and/or P2PE Assessor Employee may appeal the
> Revocation but, unless otherwise approved by PCI SSC in writing in
> each instance, will not be permitted to perform P2PE Assessments,
> process P-ROVs, or otherwise participate in the P2PE Program pending
> resolution of the appeal. The P2PE Assessor Company and/or P2PE
> Assessor Employee may reapply at a later date of two years after
> Revocation, so long as it has demonstrated to PCI SSC\'s satisfaction
> that it meets all applicable QSA, P2PE Assessor and, if applicable,
> PA-QSA requirements, as documented in the relevant PCI SSC program
> documents.

# Appendix A: P2PE Products and Acceptance

> Acceptance of a given P2PE Product by the PCI SSC only applies to the
> specific P2PE Solution, P2PE Component, or P2PE Application that has
> been validated by a P2PE Assessor and subsequently Accepted by PCI SSC
> (the "Accepted Product"). If any aspect of a P2PE Product is different
> from that which was validated by the P2PE Assessor and Accepted by PCI
> SSC---even if the different P2PE Product (the "Alternate Product")
> conforms to the basic product description of the Accepted
> Product---the Alternate Product should not be considered Accepted by
> PCI SSC, nor promoted as Accepted by PCI SSC.
>
> No P2PE Vendor or other third party may refer to a P2PE Product as
> "PCI Approved," or "PCI SSC Approved" or otherwise state or imply that
> PCI SSC has, in whole or part, approved any aspect of a P2PE Vendor or
> its P2PE Product, except to the extent and subject to the terms and
> restrictions expressly set forth in a written agreement with PCI SSC,
> or in a corresponding P-AOV provided by PCI SSC. All other references
> to PCI SSC's acceptance of a P2PE Product are strictly and actively
> prohibited by PCI SSC.
>
> When granted, PCI SSC Acceptance is provided to ensure certain
> security and operational characteristics important to the achievement
> of PCI SSC's goals, but such acceptance does, not under any
> circumstances, include or imply any endorsement or warranty regarding
> the P2PE Solution Provider or the functionality, quality, or
> performance of the P2PE Product or any other product or service. PCI
> SSC does not warrant any products or services provided by third
> parties. PCI SSC acceptance does not, under any circumstances, include
> or imply any product warranties from PCI SSC, including, without
> limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for
> purpose or non-infringement, all of which are expressly disclaimed by
> PCI SSC. All rights and remedies regarding products and services that
> have received acceptance from PCI SSC shall be provided by the party
> providing such products or services, and not by PCI SSC or any
> Participating Payment Brand.

# Appendix H: P2PE Application Software Versioning Methodology

> P2PE Application Vendors are required to document and follow a
> software versioning methodology as part of their system development
> lifecycle. Additionally, P2PE Application Vendors must communicate the
> versioning methodology to their customers and integrators/resellers in
> the *P2PE Application Implementation Guide*. Customers and
> integrators/resellers require this information to understand which
> version of the application they are using and the types of changes
> that have been made to each version of the application. P2PE Assessor
> Companies are required to verify the P2PE Application Vendor is
> adhering to the documented versioning methodology and the requirements
> of the *P2PE Program Guide* as part of the P2PE Assessment. Note that
> if a separate version-numbering scheme is maintained internally by the
> P2PE Application Vendor, a method to accurately map the internal
> version numbers to the publicly listed version number(s) must be
> documented and maintained by the P2PE Application Vendor.

## Version Number Format

> The format of the application version number is set by the P2PE
> Application Vendor and may be comprised of several elements. The
> versioning methodology and the *P2PE Application Implementation Guide*
> must fully describe the format of the application version number
> including the following:
>
> ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} The format of the version scheme,
> including:

-   Number of elements

-   Numbers of digits used for each element

-   Format of separators used between elements

-   Character set used for each element (consisting of alphabetic,
    numeric, and/or alphanumeric characters)
    ![](vertopal_9b2becadeaca440fa0346a9f3b4dce2a/media/image4.png){width="0.125in"
    height="0.1527777777777778in"} The hierarchy of the elements:

-   Definition of what each element represents in the version scheme

-   Type of change: major, minor, maintenance release, wildcard, etc.

    height="0.1527777777777778in"} The definition of elements that
    indicate any use of wildcards

> are used in the versioning methodology

## Version Number Usage

> All changes to the P2PE Application must result in a new application
> version number. However, whether this affects the version number
> listed on the Website depends on the nature of the change and the P2PE
> Application Vendor's published versioning methodology (refer to
> Section H.3, "Wildcards," below). All changes that impact security
> functionality and/or any P2PE Requirements must result in a change to
> the version number listed on the Website; wildcards are not permitted
> for changes impacting security functionality and/or any P2PE
> Requirements.
>
> The P2PE Application Vendor must document how elements of the
> application version number are used to identify:

>

## Wildcards

> A "wildcard" element is a variable character that may be substituted
> for a defined subset of possible characters in an application
> versioning scheme. In the context of P2PE Applications, wildcards can
> optionally be used to represent non-security-impacting changes between
> each version represented by the wildcard element. A wildcard is the
> only variable element of the P2PE Application Vendor's version scheme.
> Use of a wildcard element in the versioning scheme is optional and is
> not required in order for the P2PE Application to be Accepted and
> Listed. The use of wildcard elements is permitted subject to the
> following:

a)  Wildcard elements may only be used for No Impact changes, which have
    > no impact on security and/or any P2PE requirements.

b)  The use of wildcard elements is limited to the rightmost (least
    > significant) portion of the version number. For example, *1.1.x*
    > represents acceptable usage. A version methodology that includes a
    > wildcard element followed by a non-wildcard element is not
    > permitted. For example, *1.x.1* and *1.1.y.1* represent usage that
    > is not permitted.

c)  All security-impacting changes must result in a change to the
    > non-wildcard portion of the application version number and will
    > therefore result in an update to the version number listed on the
    > Website.

d)  Wildcard elements must not precede version elements that could
    > represent security-impacting changes; version elements reflecting
    > a security-impacting change must appear "to the left of" the first
    > wildcard element.

e)  All wildcard usage must be pre-defined and documented in the P2PE
    > Application Vendor's versioning methodology and the *P2PE
    > Application Implementation Guide*.

f)  All wildcard usage must be consistent with that validated by the
    > P2PE Assessor Company as part of the P2PE Assessment of the P2PE
    > Application.

# Appendix I: P2PE Applicability of Requirements

> The following matrix indicates with an "x" all P2PE Security
> Requirements that apply to P2PE Solutions (including Merchant-Managed
> Solutions), P2PE Applications, and P2PE Components.
>
> ***Note:** Each requirement denoted includes all sub-requirements
> unless indicated otherwise.*

######### Notes for the P2PE Requirement Applicability Matrix:

1.  \- Where a Solution Provider (or a Merchant as a Solution Provider
    in a Merchant-Managed Solution - MMS) is using a Listed P2PE
    Component Provider, the Solution Provider is not required to have
    the requirements applicable to that Listed P2PE Component assessed
    as part of their P2PE Solution assessment. E.g., if a Solution
    Provider outsources to a Listed P2PE Encryption Management Component
    Provider, the Solution Provider is not required to assess to any of
    the requirements denoted below for Encryption Management. Note that
    neither a Solution Provider or a Merchant-Managed Solution Provider
    are permitted to outsource any requirements in Domain 3 (and
    additionally Appendix A for MMS). However, for any key management
    services requirements (Domain 5) not otherwise included as part of
    the assessment for included Listed P2PE Component Providers, the
    Solution Provider is responsible for including all applicable key
    management services requirements in the scope of their assessment.

> E.g., if the P2PE Solution offers remote key-distribution using
> asymmetric techniques for the distribution of keys to PCI-approved POI
> devices for use in connection with account-data encryption, or the
> operation of an applicable CA/RA, or any other relevant key management
> service that has not already been assessed as part of the inclusion of
> a Listed P2PE Component Provider, then the P2PE Solution assessment
> must include all applicable key management services requirements
> (Domain 5).

2.  \- Where an Encryption Management Component Provider is using a
    Listed P2PE POI Deployment or Listed POI Management Component
    Provider, the Encryption Management Component Provider is not
    required to have the requirements applicable to that POI Deployment
    or POI Management Component Provider, as applicable, assessed as
    part of their Encryption Management Component Provider assessment.

3.  \- Where a Key Injection Facility (KIF) Component Provider is using
    a Listed P2PE Key Loading or Listed Key Management Component
    Provider, the KIF Component Provider is not required to have the
    requirements applicable to the Key Loading or Key Management
    Component Provider, as applicable, assessed as part of their KIF
    Component Provider assessment.

4.  \- The "Remote Key" requirements are additional requirements that
    apply to any entity implementing remote key distribution using
    asymmetric techniques for the distribution of keys to PCI-approved
    POI devices for use in connection with account-data encryption. Note
    that these requirements are additional requirements that must be met
    -- i.e., they cannot be assessed in isolation -- they must be
    assessed in addition to all applicable Domain 5 requirements
    relevant to the assessment. Refer to Domain 5 in the P2PE Standard
    for more information.

5.  \- These requirements apply only to entities operating Certification
    and/or Registration Authorities. Refer to Domain 5 in the P2PE
    Standard for more information.

6.  \- Merchant-Managed Solutions are not permitted to utilize a hybrid
    decryption environment unless they are using a Listed P2PE
    Decryption Management Component Provider that employs hybrid
    decryption.
