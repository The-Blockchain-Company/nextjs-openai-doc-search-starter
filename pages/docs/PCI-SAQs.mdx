> Each PCI DSS SAQ consists of the following components:

1.  Questions correlating to the PCI DSS requirements, as appropriate
    for different environments: See "Selecting the SAQ and Attestation
    that Best Apply to Your Organization" in this document. This section
    also includes a column for "Expected Testing" which is based on the
    testing procedures in PCI DSS.

2.  Attestation of Compliance: The Attestation includes your declaration
    of eligibility for completing the applicable SAQ and the subsequent
    results of a PCI DSS self-assessment.

## Why PCI DSS is Important

> The PCI Security Standards Council Participating Payment Brands
> (American Express, Discover, JCB, Mastercard, UnionPay, and Visa)
> continually monitor occurrences of account data compromise. These
> compromises cover the full spectrum of organizations, from very small
> to very large merchants and service providers.
>
> A security breach and subsequent compromise of payment card data has
> far-reaching consequences for affected organizations, including:

1.  Regulatory notification requirements,

2.  Loss of reputation,

3.  Loss of customers,

4.  Potential financial liabilities (for example, regulatory and other
    fees and fines), and

5.  Litigation.

> Forensic analysis of compromises has shown that common security
> weaknesses, which are addressed by PCI DSS controls, are often
> exploited because the PCI DSS controls either were not in place or
> were poorly implemented when the compromise occurred. PCI DSS was
> designed and includes detailed requirements for exactly this
> reason---to minimize the chance of compromise and the effects if a
> compromise does occur.
>
> Examples of common PCI DSS control failures include, but are not
> limited to:

-   Storage of sensitive authentication data (SAD), such as track data,
    after authorization (Requirement 3.2). Many compromised entities
    were unaware that their systems were storing this data.

-   Inadequate access controls due to improperly installed point-of-sale
    (POS) systems, allowing malicious users in via paths intended for
    POS vendors (Requirements 7.1, 7.2, 8.2, and 8.3).

-   Default system settings and passwords not changed when the system
    was installed (Requirement 2.1).

-   Unnecessary and insecure services not removed or secured when the
    system was installed (Requirements 2.2.2 and 2.2.3).

-   Poorly coded web applications resulting in SQL injection and other
    vulnerabilities, which allow access to the database storing
    cardholder data directly from the website (Requirement 6.5).

-   Missing and outdated security patches (Requirement 6.2).

-   Lack of logging (Requirement 10).

-   Lack of monitoring (via log reviews, intrusion detection/prevention,
    quarterly vulnerability scans, and change-detection mechanisms)
    (Requirements 10.6, 11.2, 11.4 and 11.5).

-   Poor scoping decisions---for example, excluding part of the network
    from PCI DSS scope due to inadequate network segmentation that was
    not verified to be effective (Requirement 11.3.4). This results in
    the cardholder data environment being unknowingly exposed to
    weaknesses in other parts of the network that have not been secured
    according to PCI DSS (for example, from unsecured wireless access
    points and vulnerabilities introduced via employee e-mail and web
    browsing) (Requirements 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4).

### Understanding the difference between compliance and security

> It's important to recognize the difference between being compliant and
> being secure. Being compliant with PCI DSS at one point in time does
> not prevent things from changing in your environment, which---if the
> proper controls are not implemented---could impact your security. You
> should therefore ensure that PCI DSS controls continue to be
> implemented properly as part of business-as-usual (BAU) activities and
> as defined by your overall security strategy. This will enable you to
> monitor the effectiveness of your organization's security controls on
> an ongoing basis and maintain your PCI DSS compliant environment
> between PCI DSS assessments. Examples of how PCI DSS should be
> incorporated into BAU activities are provided in the "Best Practices
> for Implementing PCI DSS into Business-as-Usual Processes" section in
> the PCI DSS.
>
> Additionally, the PCI DSS security requirements are intended for the
> protection of payment card data, and your organization may have other
> sensitive data and assets that need protecting which could be outside
> of the scope of PCI DSS. Therefore, while PCI DSS compliance, if
> properly maintained, can certainly contribute to overall security, it
> should not be viewed as a replacement for a robust, organization-wide
> security program.

### General Tips and Strategies for PCI DSS Compliance

> Following are some general tips and strategies for beginning your PCI
> DSS compliance efforts. These tips may help you eliminate storage of
> cardholder data you do not need, isolate the data you do need to
> defined and controlled centralized areas, and may allow you to limit
> the scope of your PCI DSS compliance validation effort. For example,
> by eliminating cardholder data that you don't need and/or isolating
> the data that you do need to defined and controlled areas, you can
> remove systems and networks that don't store, process, or transmit
> cardholder data---and that don't connect to systems that do---from the
> scope of your self-assessment.

2.  **Ask your POS vendor about the security of your system, with the
    following suggested questions:**

    a.  Have default settings and passwords been changed on the systems
        > and databases that are part of the POS system?

    b.  Do you access my POS system remotely? If so, have you
        > implemented appropriate controls to prevent others from
        > accessing my POS system, such as using secure remote access
        > methods and not using common or default passwords? How often
        > do you access my POS device remotely and why? Who is
        > authorized to access my POS remotely?

    c.  Have all unnecessary and insecure services been removed from the
        > systems and databases that are part of the POS system?

    d.  Is my POS software validated to the Payment Application Data
        > Security Standard (PA-DSS)? (Refer to PCI SSC's list of
        > Validated Payment Applications.)

    e.  Does my POS software store sensitive authentication data, such
        > as track data or PIN blocks? If so, this storage is
        > prohibited: how quickly can you help me remove it?

    f.  Does my POS software store primary account numbers (PANs)? If
        > so, this storage must be protected: how is the POS protecting
        > this data?

    g.  Will you document the list of files written by the application
        > with a summary of each file's contents to verify that the
        > above-mentioned, prohibited data is not stored?

    h.  Does my POS software enforce complex and unique passwords for
        > all user access?

    i.  Can you confirm that you do not use common or default passwords
        > for access to my system and other merchant systems you
        > support?

    j.  Have all the systems and databases that are part of the POS
        > system been patched with all applicable security updates?

    k.  Is the logging capability turned on for the systems and
        > databases that are part of the POS system?

    l.  If prior versions of my POS software stored sensitive
        > authentication data, has this feature been removed during
        > current updates to the POS software? Was a secure wipe utility
        > used to remove this data?

3.  #### Cardholder data---if you don't need it, don't store it!

    a.  Payment brand rules allow for the storage of primary account
        > number (PAN), expiration date, cardholder name, and service
        > code.

    b.  Take inventory of all the reasons and places you store this
        > data. If the data doesn't serve a legitimate business purpose,
        > consider eliminating it.

    c.  Think about whether the storage of that data and the business
        > process it supports are worth the following:

        i.  The risk of having the data compromised.

        ii. The additional PCI DSS controls that must be applied to
            > protect that data.

        iii. The ongoing maintenance efforts to remain PCI DSS compliant
             > over time.

4.  #### Cardholder data---if you do need it, consolidate and isolate it.

> You can limit the scope of a PCI DSS assessment by consolidating data
> storage in a defined environment and isolating the data through the
> use of proper network segmentation. For example, if your employees
> browse the Internet and receive e-mail on the same machine or network
> segment as cardholder data, consider segmenting (isolating) the
> cardholder data onto its own machine or network segment (for example,
> via routers or firewalls). If you can isolate the cardholder data
> effectively, you may be able to focus your PCI DSS efforts on just the
> isolated part rather than including all your machines.

#### Compensating Controls

> Compensating controls may be considered for most PCI DSS requirements
> when an organization cannot meet the technical specification of a
> requirement, but has sufficiently mitigated the associated risk
> through alternative controls. If your organization does not have the
> exact control specified in PCI DSS but has other controls in place
> that satisfy the PCI DSS definition of compensating controls (see
> "Compensating Controls" in PCI DSS Appendix B, and also in the *PCI
> DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms*), your
> organization should do the following:

a.  Follow the procedures for compensating controls as outlined in PCI
    > DSS Appendix B.

b.  For all requirements that were met with the assistance of a
    > compensating control, respond to the SAQ question by checking the
    > "YES with CCW" column.

c.  Document each compensating control by completing a Compensating
    > Controls Worksheet in Appendix B of the SAQ.

> PCI DSS as applicable to their environments at all times. There are a
> number of SAQ types, shown briefly in the table below and described in
> more detail in the following pages. Use the table to help determine
> which SAQ applies to your organization, and then review the detailed
> descriptions to ensure you meet all the requirements for that SAQ.
>
> ***Note for all SAQs except SAQ D:*** These SAQs include questions
> that apply to a specific type of merchant environment, as defined in
> the related SAQ eligibility criteria. If there are PCI DSS
> requirements applicable to your environment that are not covered in a
> given SAQ, it may be an indication that this SAQ is not suitable for
> your environment. Additionally, you must comply with all applicable
> PCI DSS requirements in order to be PCI DSS compliant.

    POI program as listed on the PCI SSC website (excludes SCRs);

-   The standalone, IP-connected POI devices are not connected to any
    other systems within your environment (this can be achieved via
    network segmentation to isolate POI devices from other systems);

-   The only transmission of cardholder data is from the PTS-approved
    POI devices to the payment processor;

-   The POI device does not rely on any other device (e.g., computer,
    mobile phone, tablet, etc.) to connect to the payment processor;

### SAQ C-VT -- Merchants with Web-Based Virtual Terminals, No Electronic Cardholder Data Storage

> *SAQ C-VT has been developed to address requirements applicable to
> merchants who process cardholder data only via isolated virtual
> payment terminals on a personal computer connected to the Internet.*
>
> A virtual payment terminal is web-browser-based access to an acquirer,
> processor or third-party service provider website to authorize payment
> card transactions, where the merchant manually enters payment card
> data via a securely connected web browser. Unlike physical terminals,
> virtual payment terminals do not read data directly from a payment
> card. Payment card transactions are entered manually.
>
> SAQ C-VT merchants process cardholder data only via a virtual payment
> terminal and do not store cardholder data on any computer system.
> These virtual terminals are connected to the Internet to access a
> third party that hosts the virtual terminal payment-processing
> function. This third party may be a processor, acquirer, or other
> third-party service provider who stores, processes, and/or transmits
> cardholder data to authorize and/or settle merchants' virtual terminal
> payment transactions.
>
> This SAQ option is intended to apply only to merchants who manually
> enter a single transaction at a time via a keyboard into an
> Internet-based virtual terminal solution. SAQ C-VT merchants may be
> brick-and-mortar (card-present) or mail/telephone-order
> (card-not-present) merchants.
>
> SAQ C-VT merchants will confirm that they meet the following
> eligibility criteria for this payment channel:

-   Your company's only payment processing is via a virtual payment
    terminal accessed by an Internet-connected web browser;

-   Your company's virtual payment terminal solution is provided and
    hosted by a PCI DSS validated third-party service provider;

-   Your company accesses the PCI DSS-compliant virtual payment terminal
    solution via a computer that is isolated in a single location, and
    is not connected to other locations or systems within your
    environment (this can be achieved via a firewall or network
    segmentation to isolate the computer from other systems);

-   Your company's computer does not have software installed that causes
    cardholder data to be stored (for example, there is no software for
    batch processing or store-and-forward);

-   Your company's computer does not have any attached hardware devices
    that are used to capture or store cardholder data (for example,
    there are no card readers attached);

-   Your company does not otherwise receive or transmit cardholder data
    electronically through any channels (for example, via an internal
    network or the Internet);

-   Any cardholder data your company retains is on paper (for example,
    printed reports or receipts), and these documents are not received
    electronically; **and**

-   Your company does not store cardholder data in electronic format.

### SAQ C -- Merchants with Payment Application Systems Connected to the Internet, No Electronic Cardholder Data Storage

> *SAQ C has been developed to address requirements applicable to
> merchants whose payment application systems (for example,
> point-of-sale systems) are connected to the Internet (for example, via
> DSL, cable modem, etc.).*
>
> SAQ C merchants process cardholder data via a point-of-sale (POS)
> system or other payment application systems connected to the Internet,
> do not store cardholder data on any computer system, and may be either
> brick-and-mortar (card-present) or mail/telephone-order
> (card-not-present) merchants.
>
> SAQ C merchants will confirm that they meet the following eligibility
> criteria for this payment channel:

-   Your company has a payment application system and an Internet
    connection on the same device and/or same local area network (LAN);

-   The payment application system/Internet device is not connected to
    any other systems within your environment (this can be achieved via
    network segmentation to isolate payment application system/Internet
    device from all other systems);

-   The physical location of the POS environment is not connected to
    other premises or locations, and any LAN is for a single store only;

-   Any cardholder data your company retains is on paper (for example,
    printed reports or receipts), and these documents are not received
    electronically; **and**

-   Your company does not store cardholder data in electronic format.

### SAQ P2PE -- Merchants using Only Hardware Payment Terminals in a

> **PCI SSC-listed P2PE Solution, No Electronic Cardholder Data
> Storage**
>
> *SAQ P2PE has been developed to address requirements applicable to
> merchants who process cardholder data only via payment terminals
> included in a validated and PCI SSC-listed Point-to-Point Encryption
> (P2PE) solution.*
>
> SAQ P2PE merchants do not have access to clear-text account data on
> any computer system, and only enter account data via hardware payment
> terminals from a PCI SSC-approved P2PE solution. SAQ P2PE merchants
> may be either brick-and-mortar (card-present) or mail/telephone-order
> (card-not-present) merchants. For example, a mail/telephone-order
> merchant could
>
> be eligible for SAQ P2PE if they receive cardholder data on paper or
> over a telephone, and key it directly and only into a P2PE validated
> hardware device.
>
> SAQ P2PE merchants will confirm that they meet the following
> eligibility criteria for this payment channel:

-   All payment processing is via a validated PCI P2PE solution approved
    and listed by the PCI SSC;

-   The only systems in the merchant environment that store, process or
    transmit account data are the Point of Interaction (POI) devices
    which are approved for use with the validated and PCI- listed P2PE
    solution;

-   Your company does not otherwise receive or transmit cardholder data
    electronically.

-   There is no legacy storage of electronic cardholder data in the
    environment;

-   Any cardholder data your company retains is on paper (for example,
    printed reports or receipts), and these documents are not received
    electronically; and

-   Your company has implemented all controls in the *P2PE Instruction
    Manual (PIM)* provided by the P2PE Solution Provider.

### SAQ D for Merchants -- All Other SAQ-Eligible Merchants

> *SAQ D for Merchants applies to SAQ-eligible merchants not meeting the
> criteria for any other SAQ type.*
>
> Examples of merchant environments that would use SAQ D may include but
> are not limited to:

-   E-commerce merchants who accept cardholder data on their website;

-   Merchants with electronic storage of cardholder data;

-   Merchants that don't store cardholder data electronically but that
    do not meet the criteria of another SAQ type;

-   Merchants with environments that might meet the criteria of another
    SAQ type, but that have additional PCI DSS requirements applicable
    to their environment.

### SAQ D for Service Providers -- SAQ-Eligible Service Providers

> *SAQ D for Service Providers applies to all service providers defined
> by a payment brand as being SAQ-eligible.*
>
> ***Note for SAQ D for Merchants and SAQ D for Service Providers:***
> While many organizations completing SAQ D will need to validate
> compliance with every PCI DSS requirement, some organizations with
> very specific business models may find that some requirements do not
> apply. For example, a company that does not use wireless technology in
> any capacity would not be expected to validate compliance with the
> sections of the PCI DSS that are specific to managing wireless
> technology. See the specific guidance in the respective SAQ D for
> information about the exclusion of other, specific requirements.
