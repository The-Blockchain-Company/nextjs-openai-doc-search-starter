# Introduction

> This document, the *PCI Secure Software Lifecycle (Secure SLC)
> Requirements and Assessment Procedures* (hereafter referred to as the
> "PCI Secure SLC Standard"), provides a baseline of security
> requirements with corresponding assessment procedures and guidance to
> help software vendors design, develop, and maintain secure software
> throughout the software lifecycle.
>
> The PCI Secure SLC Standard is intended for use as part of the PCI
> Software Security Framework. Under this framework, software vendors
> wishing to validate their software lifecycle management practices to
> this *PCI Secure SLC Standard* may optionally choose to do so. For
> more information on PCI Secure SLC validation, please refer to the
> *PCI Secure SLC Program Guide*.

## Terminology

> A list of applicable terms and definitions is provided in the *PCI
> Software Security Framework Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and
> Acronyms,*
>
> available in the PCI SSC Document Library:
> [[https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library]{.underline}.](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library)
>
> Additionally, definitions for general PCI terminology are provided in
> the *PCI Glossary* on the PCI SSC website at:
> [[https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/glossary]{.underline}](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/glossary).

## PCI Secure Software Lifecycle Requirements

> The security requirements defined within the *PCI Secure SLC Standard*
> (hereafter referred to as "PCI Secure SLC Requirements") expand on
> traditional software development lifecycle (SDLC) models by
> introducing security concepts and activities throughout the entire
> software lifecycleincluding the design, development, deployment, and
> maintenance phases. The security concepts described within this
> document are intended to help software vendors protect sensitive data,
> minimize vulnerabilities, and defend software from attacks throughout
> the entire software lifecycle.

## Scope of Requirements

> The PCI Secure SLC Requirements apply to the software vendor's
> processes, technology, and personnel involved in the design,
> development, deployment, and maintenance of the software vendor's
> software products and services including, but not limited to:

>
> Some software vendors may have multiple software products covered by
> different software lifecycle management programs. Prior to assessment
> against the PCI Secure SLC Requirements, software vendors should
> identify the software products and associated software lifecycle
> management program(s) to be covered under the assessment. For more
> information on defining the scope of the Secure SLC assessment, refer
> to the *PCI Secure SLC Program Guide*.

## Objective-Based Approach to Requirements

> There are numerous mature, secure software lifecycle management
> methodologies and frameworks available that, when properly implemented
> and maintained, can produce secure software^1^. In recognition of
> this, the PCI Software Security Framework has adopted an
> "objective-based" approach to defining the PCI Secure SLC
> Requirements. This approach acknowledges that there is no "one size
> fits all" method to software security, and that software vendors need
> flexibility to determine the secure software lifecycle management
> practices and methods most appropriate to address their specific
> business and software risks.
>
> For this approach to be successful, software vendors must possess a
> robust risk-management practice as an integral part of their "business
> as usual" operational processes. The specific security controls needed
> to meet certain requirements in this standardfor example, additional
> data elements identified by the software vendor as sensitive
> data^2^will depend on the software vendor's risk-management
> priorities and processes. While this approach provides the software
> vendor with flexibility to implement the appropriate security controls
> based on identified risk, the software vendor must be able to
> demonstrate how the implemented controls are supported by the results
> of its risk-management practices.
>
> Without a robust risk-management practice and evidence to support
> risk-based decision making, adherence to the PCI Secure SLC
> Requirements may be difficult to validate.
>
> Where a PCI Secure SLC Requirement does not define a specific level of
> rigor or a minimum frequency for periodic or recurring activitiesfor
> example, the required frequency the software vendor must review
> security strategy performancethe software vendor may define the level
> of rigor or frequency as appropriate for its business. The rigor and
> frequency defined by the software vendor must be supported by
> documented risk assessments and the resultant risk-management
> decisions. The software vendor must be able to demonstrate that its
> implementation provides ongoing assurance that the activities are
> effective and meet the intent of all applicable security requirements.
>
> Equally important is the need for software vendors to understand all
> the security requirements in this document and consider how the
> software vendor's software security controls and processes work
> together as a whole to satisfy the security requirements rather than
> focusing on any single requirement in isolation.
>
> ^1^ Examples of other secure software lifecycle management
> methodologies and frameworks include works from NIST, ISO, SAFECode,
> Synopsis (BSIMM), and OWASP (OpenSAMM). Please refer to these sources
> for more information about their methodologies.
>
> ^2^ Refer to the *PCI Software Security Framework Glossary of Terms,
> Abbreviations, and Acronyms* for definition of sensitive data.

## Requirements Overview

> The PCI Secure SLC Requirements are organized into four main sections:

1.  Software Security Governance

2.  Secure Software Engineering

3.  Secure Software and Data Management

4.  Security Communications

> Within each of the sections defined above, the PCI Secure SLC
> Requirements are further subdivided into the following components:
>
> ![](vertopal_dfdf71dca4514f4c93f452f9eac4b1ae/media/image3.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} **Control Objectives** -- The security
> outcomes that must be achieved. While all control objectives must be
> met in order to be validated to this *PCI Secure SLC Standard*,
> software vendors may define the specific controls, tools, methods and
> techniques they use to meet each control objective.
>
> ![](vertopal_dfdf71dca4514f4c93f452f9eac4b1ae/media/image3.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} **Test Requirements** --The validation
> activities to be performed by an assessor to confirm whether a
> specific control objective has been met. If an assessor determines
> that alternative testing methods are appropriate to validate a
> particular control objective, they must justify and document their
> testing approach as described in the [[Assessment Procedures and Test
> Requirements]{.underline}](#assessment-procedures-and-test-requirements)
> section.
>
> ![](vertopal_dfdf71dca4514f4c93f452f9eac4b1ae/media/image3.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} **Guidance** -- Additional information
> to help software vendors and assessors further understand the intent
> of each control objective and how it could be met. The guidance may
> include best practices to be considered as well as examples of
> controls or methods that, when properly implemented, could meet the
> intent of the control objective. This guidance is not intended to
> preclude other methods that a software vendor may use to meet a
> control objective, nor does it replace or amend the control objective
> to which it refers.

## Assessment Procedures and Test Requirements

> To facilitate validation of the software vendor's software lifecycle
> management practices, software vendors must produce appropriate
> evidence that confirms they have satisfied the control objectives
> defined within this standard. The test requirements identified for
> each control objective describe the expected activities to be
> performed to validate whether the software vendor has met the
> objective. Where sub-bullets are specified in a control objective or
> test requirement, each bullet must be satisfied as part of the
> validation. In addition, where terms such as "periodic,"
> "appropriate," and "reasonable" are used in the test requirement, it
> is the software vendor's responsibility to define and defend its
> decisions regarding the frequency, robustness, and maturity of the
> implemented controls or processes.
>
> Test requirements typically include the following activities:
>
> ![](vertopal_dfdf71dca4514f4c93f452f9eac4b1ae/media/image3.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} **Examine:** The assessor critically
> evaluates data evidence. Common examples of evidence include software
> design and architecture documents (electronic or physical), source
> code, configuration and metadata files, bug tracking data and other
> output from software development systems, and security-testing
> results.
>
> ![](vertopal_dfdf71dca4514f4c93f452f9eac4b1ae/media/image3.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} **Observe**: The assessor watches an
> action or views something in the environment. Examples of observation
> subjects include personnel performing tasks or processes, software or
> system components performing a function or responding to input, system
> configurations/settings, environmental conditions, and physical
> controls.
>
> ![](vertopal_dfdf71dca4514f4c93f452f9eac4b1ae/media/image3.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} **Interview**: The assessor converses
> with individual personnel. The purpose of such interviews may include
> determining how an activity is performed, whether an activity is
> performed as defined, and whether personnel have particular knowledge
> or understanding of applicable policies, processes, responsibilities,
> or concepts.
>
> The test requirements provide both software vendors and assessors with
> a common understanding of the expected validation activities to be
> performed. The specific items or processes to be examined or observed
> and the personnel to be interviewed should be appropriate for the
> control objective being validated as well as for each software
> vendor's unique organizational structure, culture, and business
> practices.
>
> When documenting the assessment results, the assessor identifies the
> testing activities performed and the result of each activity. While it
> is expected that an assessor will perform all the test requirements
> identified for each control objective, it may also be possible for a
> control objective to be validated using different or additional
> testing methods. In such cases, the assessor should document and
> justify why other testing methods were used and how those methods
> provide at least the same level of assurance as would have been
> achieved using the test requirements defined in this standard.

### Sampling

> Where appropriate, the assessor may utilize sampling as part of the
> testing process. Samples must be a representative selection of the
> people, processes, and technologies covered by the PCI Secure SLC
> assessment. The sample size must be sufficiently large to provide the
> assessor with assurance that the sample accurately reflects the larger
> population and that controls are implemented as expected.
>
> In all instances where the assessor's finding is based on a
> representative sample rather than the complete set of applicable
> items, the assessor should explicitly note this fact, detail the items
> chosen as samples for the testing, and provide a justification of the
> sampling methodology used.

## Third-Party Service Providers

> Software vendors often rely on outsourced, third-party service
> providers for certain software lifecycle management functions---e.g.,
> for software development (excluding the use of open-source code),
> performing code reviews or other testing of the software vendor's
> software, hosting for the software vendor's software development or
> delivery platforms, or integrating and installing the software
> vendor's products.
>
> Where a third-party service can affect the software vendor's software
> lifecycle management practices or the security of the software
> vendor's software, the applicable PCI Secure SLC requirements will
> need to be identified and implemented for that service. The software
> vendor and service provider will need to understand which software
> lifecycle management functions are affected by the service provider
> and identify which PCI Secure SLC Requirements are the responsibility
> of the service provider and which are the responsibility of the
> software vendor.
>
> The software vendor is expected to have processes in place to manage
> risks associated with third-party service providers, including (as
> applicable for each service):

> height="0.1527777777777778in"} A written agreement to ensure both
> parties understand and acknowledge their security responsibilities.
>
> While the ultimate responsibility for the security of the software
> lies with the software vendor, service providers may be required to
> demonstrate compliance with the applicable PCI Secure SLC Requirements
> based on the provided service. The service provider may do so by
> either:

(a) Undergoing its own PCI Secure SLC assessment for the applicable
    product(s) or service(s) provided to the software vendor, and
    providing evidence to the software vendor that demonstrates its
    compliance to the applicable Secure SLC requirements for that
    product/service; or

(b) Having the applicable product(s) or service(s) included in the
    software vendor's PCI Secure SLC assessment, and allowing the
    software vendor's assessor to evaluate whether the product/service
    meets the applicable PCI Secure SLC Requirements.

> The evidence provided by service providers should be sufficient to
> verify that the scope of the service provider's PCI Secure SLC
> assessment covers the services applicable to the software vendor's
> software lifecycle management practices, and that the relevant PCI
> Secure SLC Requirements were validated. The specific type of evidence
> provided will depend on how the assessments are managed. For example,
> if the service provider undergoes its own PCI Secure SLC assessment,
> the resulting Report on Compliance (ROC) could provide some or all of
> the information needed by the software vendor's assessor to validate
> applicable PCI Secure SLC Requirements. If the service is being
> included in the software vendor's PCI Secure SLC assessment, the
> evidence provided would be determined by the control objectives being
> assessed and the test requirements for those control objectives.
