# Introduction: Security Requirements for Point-to-Point Encryption

## Purpose of this Document

> This document, *Point-to-Point Encryption: Security Requirements and
> Testing Procedures,* defines both security requirements and testing
> procedures for Point-to-Point Encryption *(*P2PE) solutions and
> components. The objective of this standard is to facilitate the
> development, approval, and deployment of PCI-approved P2PE solutions
> that will increase the protection of account data by encrypting that
> data from the point of interaction (POI) within the encryption
> environment where account data is captured through to the point of
> decrypting that data inside a decryption environment, effectively
> removing clear-text account data between these two points.
>
> The requirements contained within this standard are intended for P2PE
> solution providers and other entities that provide P2PE components or
> P2PE applications for use in P2PE solutions, as well as P2PE assessors
> evaluating these entities. Additionally, merchants benefit from using
> P2PE solutions due to increased protection of account data and
> subsequent reduction in the presence of clear-text account data within
> their environments.

## Types of Solution Providers

### P2PE Solution Provider

> A P2PE solution provider is an entity with a third-party relationship
> with respect to its merchant customers (e.g., a processor, acquirer,
> or payment gateway) that has overall responsibility for the design and
> implementation of a specific P2PE solution and manages P2PE solutions
> for its merchant customers. The solution provider has overall
> responsibility for ensuring that all P2PE requirements are met,
> including any P2PE requirements performed by third-party organizations
> on behalf of the solution provider (e.g., certification authorities or
> key-injection facilities).

### Merchant as a Solution Provider/Merchant-managed Solution

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The terms "merchant as a solution provider" and "merchant-managed solution" apply to merchants who choose to manage     ***For
  their own P2PE solutions on behalf of their own merchant encryption environments rather than outsourcing the solution   merchant-managed
  to a third-party P2PE solution provider.                                                                                solutions, where the
  [Appendix](#appendix-a-merchant-managed-solutions-separation-between-merchant-encryption-and-decryption-environments)   term "merchant" is
  [A](#appendix-a-merchant-managed-solutions-separation-between-merchant-encryption-and-decryption-environments) defines  used in Domains 1, 3,
  the separation needed between encryption environments where the encrypting POI devices are physically located and the   4, and 5 of this
  merchant's account-data decryption environment (and other merchant cardholder data environments) for a merchant-managed document, those

  specified in [Appendix                                                                                                  the merchant's
  A,](#appendix-a-merchant-managed-solutions-separation-between-merchant-encryption-and-decryption-environments)          encryption
  merchants acting as their own solution providers have the same responsibilities of solution providers mentioned         environments and

## Scope of Assessment

> The security requirements are not intended to require an assessment of
> a merchant's encryption environment (excluding merchant-managed
> solutions where the merchant is both the merchant customer and the
> solution provider). P2PE Components, Applications, and Solutions may
> exist initially in the absence of any merchant customers or
> merchant-specific implementation. Where applicable, the entity being
> assessed must be able to demonstrate the capability to meet the
> security objectives as they apply to the implementation.

## Definition of Secure Cryptographic Devices (SCDs) to be used in P2PE Solutions

> Secure cryptographic devices (SCDs) are used for the encryption and
> decryption of account data, signing P2PE Applications, non-payment
> software, and whitelists, as well as for the storage and management of
> cryptographic keys. SCDs include but are not limited to key-loading
> devices (KLDs), point-of-interaction (POI) encryption devices, and
> hardware security modules (HSMs). An SCD used for the acceptance and
> encryption of account data at the point of sale is required to be a
> PCI-approved POI device, which is a device evaluated and approved via
> the PCI PTS program and includes SRED (secure reading and exchange of
> data). HSMs used within the decryption environment for decryption of
> account data and related cryptographic key operations must be approved
> to either *FIPS PUB 140-2* / *140-3* (overall level 3 or higher) or
> the PCI HSM standard.

## P2PE Solutions: Hardware Decryption or Hybrid Decryption

> For PCI P2PE solutions, the encryption environment at the point of
> merchant acceptance consists exclusively of hardware encryption
> performed within PCI-approved POI devices.
>
> PCI P2PE decryption environments require HSMs for *all* management of
> cryptographic keys, and that HSMs be used for decryption of account
> data (hardware decryption); or optionally account-data decryption can
> occur outside an HSM in non-SCD "Host Systems" (hybrid decryption)
> meeting additional hybrid decryption requirements specified in Domains
> 4 and 5, in Sections **4D** and **5H,** respectively.
>
> *Note that hybrid decryption is NOT an option for merchant-managed
> solutions.*

## SCD Domain Applicability

> P2PE solutions require the use of various types of SCDs. To assist in
> evaluating these device types, the following matrix indicates the
> domains each SCD type must be assessed to. The P2PE Standard does not
> require an evaluation of the physical and logical controls (i.e., the
> hardware and firmware of an SCD), which must have already been
> evaluated and approved as part of PCI HSM, *FIPS 140-2* or *140-3*, or
> PCI PTS POI, as applicable.

## P2PE Solutions and Use of Third Parties and/or P2PE Component Providers

> A given P2PE solution may be entirely performed and managed by a
> single solution provider or by a merchant acting as its own solution
> provider (Merchant-Managed Solution, or MMS); or certain services may
> be outsourced to third parties who perform these functions on behalf
> of the solution provider. All third parties that perform P2PE
> functions on behalf of a P2PE solution provider must be validated per
> applicable P2PE solution requirements, and such entities have the
> option of becoming P2PE component providers.
>
> A **"P2PE component provider*" ***is an entity that provides a service
> assessed to a specific set of P2PE requirements and results in a P2PE
> component provider listing on the PCI SSC website. P2PE component
> providers' services are performed on behalf of other P2PE solution
> providers for use in P2PE solutions.
>
> There are two options for third-party entities performing functions on
> behalf of solution providers to validate compliance:

1.  Undergo a P2PE assessment of relevant P2PE requirements on their own
    and submit the applicable P2PE Report on Validation (P-ROV) to PCI
    SSC for review and acceptance. Upon acceptance, the P2PE component
    is listed on PCI SSC's list of *Validated P2PE Components*.

> **Or**,

2.  Have their services reviewed during the course of each of their
    solution-provider or component-provider customers' P2PE assessments.
    Accordingly, a solution can be reviewed via one of the following
    scenarios:

    1.  The solution provider can perform all domains in their entirety.

        -   A merchant as a solution provider (MMS) can perform all
            > domains (*including* Appendix A) in their entirety.

    2.  A solution provider (or a merchant as a solution provider) can
        outsource functions and have them assessed as part of the
        solution provider's P2PE assessment.

    3.  A solution provider (or a merchant as a solution provider) can
        outsource certain P2PE functions to PCI-listed P2PE component
        providers and report use of the PCI-listed P2PE component(s) in
        their P2PE Report on Validation (P-ROV).

> Via requirements specified in Domain 3, solution providers (or
> merchants as solution providers) must manage the overall P2PE solution
> and any third parties used to perform P2PE functions on their behalf,
> whether those third parties are separately listed by PCI SSC as P2PE
> component providers or are assessed as part of the solution provider's
> P2PE assessment.

## P2PE Solutions and Use of P2PE Applications and/or P2PE Non-payment Software

## For Assessors: Sampling for P2PE Solutions

> After considering the overall scope and complexity of the P2PE
> environment being assessed, the assessor may independently select
> representative samples of certain system components in order to assess
> P2PE requirements.
>
> Selected samples must be representative of all variations or types of
> a particular system component. Samples must be of sufficient size to
> provide the assessor with assurance that controls are implemented as
> expected across the entire population. Samples should be varied, where
> possible, with each assessment.
>
> Sampling of system components for assessment purposes does not reduce
> the scope of the solution-provider environment or the applicability of
> P2PE requirements. Whether or not sampling is to be used, P2PE
> requirements apply to the entire solution-provider environment. If
> sampling is used, each sample must be assessed against all applicable
> P2PE requirements. Sampling of the P2PE requirements themselves is not
> permitted.
>
> Any sampling of POI devices and their applications, cryptographic
> keys, and key components must follow these principles:
>
> ![](vertopal_60a238a099614e179dec6351a3c50457/media/image2.png){width="0.125in"
> height="0.1527777777777778in"} POI devices and applications/software
> must include every unique combination of hardware, firmware, and
> versions and configurations of both P2PE applications and P2PE
> non-payment software used by the solution.

## Multiple Acquirers

> The P2PE standard outlines the technology and processes needed to
> ensure the security of a solution that protects account data from the
> point of interaction to the point of initial decryption. In some
> instances, multiple acquirers or multiple solution providers may
> manage one or more P2PE solutions on the same merchant POI device.
> P2PE does not preclude these scenarios, as the business processes
> governing this shared environment are outside the responsibility of
> the PCI SSC. Vendors and merchants should be aware that in order for a
> P2PE solution to be listed on the PCI SSC website, each solution must
> be evaluated and tested, either independently or collectively. Once
> listed, merchants can then work with their acquirers to select a
> device and validated solution provider(s) that meet their
> multiple-acquirer needs.

> ***Target audience:** Application vendors designing applications (that
> have access to clear-text account data) for use within PCI-approved
> POI devices as part of a P2PE solution.*

#### *Overview*

> Although point-of-interaction (POI) devices are often considered as
> "hardware" devices, software is often added to POI devices after the
> PIN Transaction Security (PTS) evaluation and approval. (Such a device
> is referred to as a "PCI-approved POI device" after the PTS evaluation
> and approval is complete.) It is vital to the security of these
> devices---and the systems that rely on the operation of these
> devices---that any such software is assessed to confirm its secure
> operation. To this end, P2PE requirements specify both the
> confirmation that a PCI-approved POI device is in use and that P2PE
> applications and P2PE non-payment software are installed and
> configured on the device properly (Domain 1), as well as the
> independent assessment of all P2PE applications (with access to
> clear-text account data) that are resident within the POI device
> (Domain 2).
>
> required to meet requirements specified at **1C-2** and are not
> required to meet Domain 2 requirements.
>
> See ["P2PE Solutions and use of Third Parties and/or P2PE Component
> Providers"](#p2pe-solutions-and-use-of-third-parties-andor-p2pe-component-providers)
> for more information about P2PE applications and software, and about
> validating P2PE applications per this domain.

#### *Use of a "Test Platform"*

> To facilitate testing applications in accordance with the test
> procedures contained in this standard, it may be necessary for the
> application vendor to provide a test platform. A test platform is
> considered to be special test functionality that is either separate or
> absent from production-level code. The test platform must rely on as
> much underlying intended production-level functionality as possible.
> The test platform is only to serve the purpose of providing a test
> framework that allows for application functionality to be exercised
> outside of a P2PE production-level deployment environment in order to
> verify the application's compliance to the applicable P2PE
> requirements. For example, elevated privileges or access capabilities
> may need to be granted for the purpose of providing run-time
> visibility into various facets of the application\'s functionality.
> Other examples are providing a test function to initiate a test
> transaction or simulating an ECR connection. It is at the P2PE
> assessor's discretion to request any test functionality deemed
> required to verify the application's compliance to any applicable P2PE
> requirements.

#### *Domain 2 Informative Annex -- Application's Implementation Guide*

> There are multiple requirements throughout Domain 2 covering content
> for the application's *Implementation Guide*, which is a required
> document per **2C-3.** All requirements for the *Implementation Guide*
> are summarized in the *Domain 2 Informative Annex*.

#### *Overview*

> The effective management and integration of the essential elements
> comprising the P2PE solution ultimately results in the absence of
> clear-text account data within the merchant's encryption
> environment---e.g., merchant stores, shops, retail premises, etc.
> Domain 3 is critical to the P2PE solution due to the fact that P2PE
> solutions consist of numerous devices/products (POI devices,
> Applications, HSMs) operating in various environments (encryption,
> decryption, and key-injection), and all of these devices, products,
> and environments must be successfully integrated together and managed.

  solution provider can easily 1) determine   (PIM) for its encryption
  required content for the PIM, and 2)        environments.*
  transfer that content to the template to    
  produce the PIM deliverable for merchants.  
  The PIM provides merchants pertinent        
  guidance to effectively and securely manage 
  their encryption environments and devices   
  within their purview: e.g., the secure      
  installation of POI devices, monitoring POI 
  devices for signs of tampering, and         
  appropriate incident response procedures    
  for security incidents.

> ***Target Audience:** P2PE solution providers or those who, on behalf
> of P2PE solution providers, manage cryptographic key operations for
> POI devices, HSMs, and SCDs.*

#### *Overview*

> Domain 5 covers the requirements for the use of strong cryptographic
> keys and secure key-management functions for all account-data
> encryption POI devices and decryption HSMs, including related
> key-management SCDs. Examples include POI devices, HSMs,
> key-injection/loading devices (KLDs) and signing devices.
> Implementation of these procedures is fundamental to the security of a
> P2PE solution. Domain 5 includes detailed key-management procedures
> including encryption methodologies, key generation, key distribution,
> key loading, key usage, key administration, equipment management, and
> hybrid decryption-key management (for hybrid decryption solutions
> only).
>
> These requirements apply to all methods of key management that are
> utilized by the P2PE solution, including both asymmetric and symmetric
> methods (examples of symmetric key-management methods include fixed
> key, DUKPT, and master key/session key). Whenever encryption is being
> utilized, some form of key management must be performed, and it is
> this key management that must be compliant to the requirements of this
> domain.
>
> Domain 5 requirements address secure cryptographic key-management
> operations for the encryption environment and the decryption
> environment, as well as environments performing symmetric-key
> distribution using asymmetric keys (remote key distribution),
> certification authority/registration authority and key-injection or
> key-generation.
>
> The requirements in this domain apply to all key types, including keys
> used to secure account data, any key-encrypting keys used to encrypt
> these keys, and any keys that have a direct bearing on the security of
> the P2PE solution (e.g., keys used to protect the integrity of a
> whitelist). If the solution uses a multi-tier "key hierarchy," all
> keys up to and including the top-level "master key" must be assessed
> to meet these requirements.
>
> Vendor-controlled secret and private keys used in connection with the
> following activities are also in scope:

> height="0.1527777777777778in"} When used in connection with
> vendor-operated PKIs used for remote key loading using asymmetric
> techniques. This applies specifically to the distribution of acquirer
> keys to transaction-originating devices (POIs) for use in connection
> with account-data encryption, whether the actual distribution of
> acquirer keys occurs from the transaction-processing host or is
> distributed directly by the vendor. This includes:

-   Root and Subordinate Certification Authority keys and keys used in
    > connection with associated Registration Authority activities

-   Device-specific key pairs used for that purpose

-   Keys associated with protection of the aforementioned keys during
    > storing, loading, and usage

-   The generation of the aforementioned keys

> data when conveyed between non-integrated PCI-listed POI
> devices---e.g., an SCR and a PIN pad.
>
> Additionally, acquirer keys generated on behalf of the acquirer are in
> scope.

#### *Symmetric-Key Distribution using Asymmetric Techniques*

> Domain 5 also contains requirements that apply to remote
> key-establishment and distribution applications. Remote
> key-distribution schemes can be used for initial key loading
> only---i.e., establishment of a TDEA key hierarchy, such as a terminal
> master key. Standard symmetric-key- exchange mechanisms should be used
> for subsequent TMK, DEK, or other symmetric-key exchanges, except
> where a device requires a new key initialization due to unforeseen
> loss of the existing TMK. Using asymmetric techniques for routine key
> exchange can result in unnecessary exposure to man-in-the-middle
> attacks and should not be used. These requirements pertain to two
> distinct areas:

##### Remote Key-Distribution Using Asymmetric Techniques Operations:

> Characteristics of the actual key-distribution methodology
> implemented. These requirements apply to all entities implementing
> remote key- distribution using asymmetric techniques for the
> distribution of keys to POI devices for use in connection with
> account-data encryption. If the key loading is not performed remotely
> and authentication is provided by another method---such as properly
> implemented dual control and key-loading device(s)---even if these
> systems involve the use of certificates, the remote key-establishment
> and distribution applications requirements will not apply. "Remotely"
> means whenever the key-loading device and the POI device are neither
> co-located nor connected via a direct mechanism, such as a cable. This
> includes:

-   The distribution of symmetric keys using asymmetric techniques from
    > a key-distribution host (KDH) to many key-receiving devices
    > (KRDsi.e., POI devices); or

-   The exchange of keys between peers, where one is administratively
    > designated as the KDH and one as the KRD (e.g., the transaction
    > processing host).

> *ANSI TR-34* presents a methodology that is compliant with these
> requirements. TR34 describes a method for transporting a symmetric key
> from one SCD to another over an uncontrolled channel. A typical
> example usage of TR34 would be to load individual initial symmetric
> transport keys from a Key Distribution Host (KDH) to a population of
> PEDs. TR34 makes use of asymmetric cryptography to protect this key
> transport, which means that both the Key-Distribution Host, and the
> Key-Receiving Devices (e.g., PEDs), must have appropriate credentials
> in the form of certificates, public and private keys, and must have a
> common relationship with a Certificate Authority (CA). The CA can be
> an independent party from both the Key-Receiving Device (KRD) vendor
> and the KDH, or the KRD vendor can be the CA.

##### Certification and Registration Authority Operations:

> Operations of Certification and Registration Authority platforms used
> in connection with remote key-distribution implementations. These
> requirements apply only to the entities operating Certification and/or
> Registration Authorities.
>
> Certification Authority requirements apply to all entities (P2PE
> solution providers, P2PE component providers, and entities performing
> these functions on behalf of solution providers or component
> providers) signing public keys to be used for remote distribution of
> cryptographic keys, whether in X.509 certificate-based schemes or
> other designs, to allow for the required authentication of these
> signed public keys. For purposes of these requirements, a certificate
> is any digitally signed value containing a public key, where the term
> "digitally signed" refers to any cryptographic method used that
> enforces the integrity and authenticity of a block of data through the
> cryptographic processing of that block of data with a private key. The
> CA requirements apply only to methods that allow for the distribution
> and use of
>
> such signed public keys to multiple systems, and as such do not apply
> to systems that apply symmetric cryptography to keys for
> authentication (such as through the use of MACs).
>
> The Certification Authority requirements are not intended to be
> applied to devices that sign their own keys, nor to key-loading
> systems where the key loading is not performed remotely and
> authentication is provided by another method---such as properly
> implemented dual control and key-loading device(s)---even if these
> systems involve the use of certificates.
>
> Unless otherwise specified, the term Certification Authority (CA)
> refers to any CA in the hierarchy, Root or SubCa.

#### *Key-Injection Facilities*

> The term key-injection facility (KIF) describes those entities that
> perform key injection of POI devices used for account-data encryption
> and key injection of HSMs used for decryption. Key injection may be
> performed by the solution provider or by a third party such as a POI
> terminal manufacturer or vendor. Domain 5 contains requirements that
> apply to key-injection facilities, or other entities that are
> performing KIF-related services for others, such as key generation or
> key loading*.*
>
> Key-injection systems that allow clear-text secret and/or private keys
> and/or their components to appear in unprotected memory (e.g., within
> a computer and outside of the secure boundary of a secure
> cryptographic device) are inherently less secure. Any such systems are
> subject to additional controls as delineated in the criteria in this
> domain.

-   *Key-encryption keys used to encrypt the BDKs when the BDKs are
    conveyed between entities (e.g., from the BDK owner to a device
    manufacturer that is performing key-injection on their behalf, or
    from a merchant to a third party that is injecting keys on their
    behalf);*

-   *Terminal master keys (TMKs) used in the master key/session key
    key-management method;*

-   *PIN-encryption keys used in the fixed-transaction key method;*

-   *Master keys for key-injection platforms and systems that include
    hardware devices (SCDs) for managing (e.g., generating and storing)
    the keys used to encrypt other keys for storage in the key-injection
    platform system;*

-   *Public and private key pairs loaded into the POIs for supporting
    remote key-establishment and distribution applications;*

-   *Digitally signed POI public key(s) signed by a device manufacture's
    private key and subsequently loaded into the POI for supporting
    certain key- establishment and distribution applications protocols
    (if applicable). Dual control is not necessary where other
    mechanisms exist to validate the authenticity of the key, such as
    the presence in the device of an authentication key;*

-   *Device manufacturer's authentication key (e.g., vendor root CA

> For implementations using FFC or ECC:

1.  **FFC implementations --** Entities must securely generate and
    distribute the system-wide parameters: generator *g,* prime number
    *p* and parameter *q,* the large prime factor of (*p* - 1).
    Parameter *p* must be at least 2048 bits long, and parameter *q*
    must be at least 224 bits long. Each entity must generate a private
    key *x* and a public key *y* using the domain parameters (*p, q,
    g*,).

2.  **ECC implementations --** Entities must securely generate and
    distribute the system-wide parameters. Entities may generate the
    elliptic curve domain parameters or use a recommended curve (See
    *FIPS186-4*). The elliptic curve specified by the domain parameters
    must be at least as secure as P-224. Each entity must generate a
    private key *d* and a public key *Q* using the specified elliptic
    curve domain parameters. (See *FIPS186-4* for methods of generating
    *d* and *Q*).

3.  Each private key must be statistically unique, unpredictable, and
    created using an approved random number generator as described in
    this document.

4.  Entities must authenticate the FFC or ECC public keys using either
    DSA, ECDSA, a certificate, or a symmetric MAC (see *ISO 16609 --
    Banking --Requirements for message authentication using symmetric
    techniques).* One of the following should be used: MAC algorithm 1
    using padding method 3, MAC algorithm 5 using padding method 4).

> ***Target Audience:** This appendix, in addition to applicable
> Domains, applies only to merchants that manage their own P2PE
> solutions.*

#### *Overview*

> Some merchants may choose to manage their own P2PE solution on behalf
> of their own merchant encryption environments rather than fully
> outsourcing the solution to a third-party solution provider. This type
> of P2PE solution is defined as a "*merchant-managed solution*" since
> the merchant is acting as its own P2PE solution provider. This
> appendix specifies the additional requirements that must be met for a
> *merchant- managed solution* with the objective of reducing the
> presence of clear-text account data within their encryption
> environments.
>
> This appendix is ***only*** applicable to *merchants acting as their
> own P2PE solution providers*, as defined in this Standard. This
> appendix is ***not*** applicable to third-party solution providers who
> manage P2PE solutions on behalf of merchants. *Merchants acting as
> their own P2PE solution providers* are responsible for ensuring all
> requirements and domains within this P2PE standard are met, either
> directly or in conjunction with P2PE component providers.
>
> Merchants may use a service provider(s) or P2PE component providers to
> perform some P2PE functions. For example, a *merchant acting as its
> own P2PE solution provider* may choose to outsource POI device
> management and cryptographic key management to another entity. In this
> scenario, both the merchant and the third party may be responsible for
> meeting different P2PE requirements. While P2PE requirements may be
> met by either the merchant directly or by a third party on the
> merchant's behalf, the *merchant acting as its own P2PE solution
> provider* is ultimately responsible for ensuring that all P2PE
> requirements are met.
>
> If the merchant manages any element of the solution---that is, if any
> requirement from Domains 1, 2, 4, or 5 is under the merchant's
> control---the merchant must meet Domain 3 in addition to this appendix
> to ensure all P2PE requirements are being met (either by the merchant
> as the solution provider itself or by a P2PE component provider).
>
> See ["P2PE Solutions and use of Third Parties and/or P2PE Component
> Providers"](#p2pe-solutions-and-use-of-third-parties-andor-p2pe-component-providers)
> for more information about solution providers, component providers,
> and merchant as a solution provider.

#### *Eligibility Criteria*

> In a merchant-managed solution, the merchant retains control over the
> entire solution, from point of capture and encryption at the POI
> devices in the encryption environment through to the decryption of
> P2PE transaction data. There is inherently greater risk to the
> security of the account data when a merchant possesses autonomous
> control over the P2PE solution without having the separation between
> the encryption and decryption environments that is naturally included
> when the solution is delivered by a third-party. Therefore, *merchants
> acting as their own solution provider* must meet the following
> additional criteria to be eligible for P2PE solution validation:
