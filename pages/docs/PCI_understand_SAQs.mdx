Understanding the SAQs for PCI DSS version 3

> The PCI DSS self-assessment questionnaires (SAQs) are validation tools

> *\* New for PCI DSS v3.0*

# What's new in version 3 of the SAQs?

> The format of the self-assessment questionnaire (SAQs) has been
> updated in version 3 to provide more guidance and reporting
> information for each PCI DSS requirement.
>
> A new column titled "Expected Testing" describes the testing
> activities to be performed during the self- assessment, to help the
> entity determine whether a requirement has been met. The "Special"
> column from version 2 has been replaced with two separate columns in
> version 3: "Yes with CCW" (compensating control worksheet) and "N/A."
> These updated response options help entities to more clearly identify
> which response to use for each requirement. The orientation of the
> SAQs has changed from portrait to landscape to accommodate these
> additional columns.
>
> There is also additional guidance provided at the beginning of the
> SAQs to assist with understanding how to complete the SAQ. The
> sections within the SAQ documents have been reorganized, such that
> Parts 3 and 4 of the AOC now follow the questionnaire portion of the
> SAQ. This is to ensure that an entity's attestation encompasses all
> elements of the SAQ and AOC.
>
> Additional guidance and information about SAQ format is provided in
> the "Before you Begin" section of each SAQ.

# How will the SAQ updates impact my organization?

> With PCI DSS version 3, there are new SAQs as well as updated
> eligibility criteria for existing SAQs, and organizations will need to
> review the eligibility criteria to understand which SAQ may now be
> right for them. For example, one of the new SAQs may be better aligned
> with an organization's particular environment than the SAQ used
> previously. Similarly, an organization that previously completed one
> type of SAQ will need to review the criteria for that particular SAQ
> to determine whether it is still appropriate for their environment.
>
> The SAQ updates for version 3 may also mean that a merchant may need
> to validate additional requirements, which could impact how the
> merchant approaches their self-assessment.
>
> Even where the eligibility criteria have not changed for a particular
> SAQ, the SAQ may include different PCI DSS requirements in version 3
> than in version 2. The questions in each SAQ have been updated to
> reflect changes made to PCI DSS version 3. For example, some complex
> requirements have been broken down into sub-requirements, and other
> requirements may have been clarified or extended, resulting in updated
> questions in the SAQs.
>
> Merchants should continue to choose an applicable SAQ based upon the
> defined eligibility criteria for each SAQ, and according to
> instructions from their acquirer or payment brand(s).

# What are the new SAQs for PCI DSS version 3?

> SAQ A-EP is a new SAQ for e-commerce merchants who outsource their
> transaction-processing functions to PCI DSS compliant third-party
> service providers, where the merchant website controls how the
> cardholder data is redirected to the third-party service provider. To
> be eligible for this SAQ, the merchant must not store, process, or
> transmit cardholder data on any of their systems or premises.
>
> SAQ B-IP is a new SAQ for merchants who process cardholder data only
> via standalone, PTS- approved point-of-interaction (POI) devices that
> have an IP connection to their payment processor, and do not
> electronically store cardholder data. To be eligible for this SAQ, the
> merchant must be using payment terminals that are currently listed on
> the *PTS List of Approved POI Devices*
> ([[https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/approved_pin_transaction_sec]{.underline}](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/approved_pin_transaction_security.php)
> [[urity.php]{.underline}](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/approved_pin_transaction_security.php)).
> Note that the Secure Card Reader (SCR) class of POI devices does not
> meet the criteria for SAQ B-IP, and thus merchant using SCRs are not
> eligible for this SAQ. SAQ B-IP is not applicable to e-commerce
> channels.

# What is the intent of SAQ A-EP?

> SAQ A-EP has been developed to differentiate between merchants that
> have partially outsourced management of their e-commerce transactions,
> and merchants that have completely outsourced all management of their
> e-commerce environment (SAQ A merchants).
>
> As with SAQ A, SAQ A-EP merchants do not electronically store,
> process, or transmit any cardholder data on their systems or premises,
> but rely entirely on a third party(s) to handle these functions. All
> processing of cardholder data is outsourced to a PCI DSS validated
> third-party payment processor for both SAQ A and SAQ A-EP.
>
> Prior to the release of SAQ A-EP, many e-commerce merchants with web
> sites that impacted the security of payment transactions may have felt
> they were eligible for SAQ A because their web server does not store,
> process, or transmit cardholder data. As a result, these web servers
> did not have sufficient security controls applied to them and have
> become common targets for attackers as a means to compromise
> cardholder data.
>
> SAQ A-EP is intended to identify the controls needed to secure
> merchant web sites that control or manage the payment transaction, and
> reduce the likelihood a breach of the web site can be used to
> compromise cardholder data.

# How does SAQ A-EP compare to SAQ A?

> The following table provides a high-level overview of some of the key
> similarities and differences between SAQ A and SAQ A-EP.

# What types of e-commerce implementations are eligible for SAQ A-EP vs. SAQ A?

> To be eligible for SAQ A, e-commerce merchants must meet all
> eligibility criteria detailed in SAQ A, including that there are no
> programs or application code that capture payment information on the
> merchant website. Examples of e-commerce implementations addressed by
> SAQ A include:

-   Merchant has no access to their website, and the website is entirely
    > hosted and managed by a compliant third-party payment processor

-   Merchant website provides an inline frame (iFrame) to a PCI DSS
    compliant third-party processor facilitating the payment process.

-   Merchant website contains a URL link redirecting users from merchant
    website to a PCI DSS compliant third-party processor facilitating
    the payment process.

> If any element of a payment page delivered to consumers' browsers
> originates from the merchant's website, SAQ A does not apply; however,
> SAQ A-EP may be applicable. Examples of e-commerce implementations
> addressed by SAQ A-EP include:

-   Merchant website creates the payment form, and the payment data is
    delivered directly from the consumer browser to the payment
    processor (often referred to as "Direct Post").

-   Merchant website loads or delivers script that runs in consumers'
    browsers (for example, JavaScript) and provides functionality that
    supports creation of the payment page and/or how the data is
    transmitted to the payment processor.

# What is the intent of SAQ B-IP?

> SAQ B-IP has been developed to differentiate between merchants using
> only standalone payment terminals that connect to their payment
> processors via an IP-based connection, from merchants who connect to
> their payment processor using only dial-out connections (which may
> meet the criteria of SAQ B). To be eligible for SAQ B-IP, merchants
> must be using payment terminals that have been approved under the PCI
> PTS program and are listed on the PCI SSC website as approved devices.
> Note that merchants using the Secure Card Reader (SCR) category of
> devices are NOT eligible for SAQ B-IP.
>
> Other eligibility criteria for SAQ B-IP include that the approved
> devices are segmented from other systems within the environment, and
> the devices do not rely on any other device (e.g., computer, mobile
> phone, tablet, etc.) to connect to the payment processor.
> Additionally, to be eligible for SAQ B- IP, the only permitted
> transmission of cardholder data is from the PTS-approved device to the
> payment processor, and the merchant must not store cardholder data in
> electronic format. SAQ B-IP, like SAQ B, is not applicable to
> e-commerce channels.
>
> Prior to the release of SAQ B-IP, merchants with this type of
> environment may have needed to complete SAQ C or SAQ D. These
> merchants may now be eligible to use SAQ B-IP, which may be better
> suited for their particular environment and provides a simpler
> validation than SAQ C.

# How does SAQ B-IP compare to SAQ B?

> The following table provides a high-level overview of some of the key
> similarities and differences between SAQ B and SAQ B-IP.
