+===================+==================================================+
| **Clarification** | Clarifies intent of requirement or testing       |
|                   | procedure. Ensures that concise wording in the   |
|                   | standard portrays the desired intent of          |
|                   | requirements.                                    |

| guidance**        | increase understanding or provide further        |
|                   | information or guidance on a particular topic.   |

| New**             | date with emerging threats and changes in the    |
|                   | market. May consist of a new or modified         |
|                   | requirement, test procedure, or context.         |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| **Removal**       | Deleted a requirement or context due to          |
|                   | redundancy or to better reflect the intent of    |
|                   | the standard.                                    |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| **Restructure**   | Changes to eliminate redundant requirements or   |
|                   | better align content with other                  |
|                   | requirements/standards.                          |
