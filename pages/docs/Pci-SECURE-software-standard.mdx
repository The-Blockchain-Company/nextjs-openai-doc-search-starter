# Introduction

> To ensure reliable and accurate electronic payment transactions, the
> systems and software used as part of the payment transaction flow must
> be designed, developed, and maintained in a manner that protects the
> integrity of payment transactions and the confidentiality of all
> sensitive data stored, processed, or transmitted in association with
> payment transactions. This document, the *Payment Card Industry (PCI)
> Secure Software Requirements and Assessment Procedures* (hereafter
> referred to as the "PCI Secure Software Standard" or "this standard")
> provides a baseline of security requirements with corresponding
> assessment procedures and guidance for building secure payment
> software.
>
> The *PCI Secure Software Standard* is intended for use as part of the
> PCI Software Security Framework (SSF). Entities wishing to have their
> payment software validated under the PCI SSF would do so to this
> standard.

# Overview of PCI Secure Software Standard

> The security requirements defined within the *PCI Secure Software
> Standard* ensure that payment software is designed, engineered,
> developed, and maintained in a manner that protects payment
> transactions and data, minimizes vulnerabilities, and defends against
> attacks.

## Scope of Security Requirements

> The security requirements defined in this standard describe the
> security characteristics, controls, features, and capabilities that
> payment software must possess to protect the integrity of payment
> functions and the confidentiality of sensitive payment data. The
> payment software features that are in scope for these requirements
> include, but are not limited to:

-   All end-to-end payment software functionality, including:

    -   All payment functions.

    -   Inputs and outputs.

    -   Handling of error conditions.

    -   Interfaces and connections to other files, systems, and/or
        > software.

    -   Data flows.

    -   Security mechanisms, controls, and countermeasures, such as
        > authentication, authorization, validation, parameterization,
        > segmentation, logging, and so on.

-   Processes used by the software vendor, provider, or developer to
    identify and support software security controls.

-   Guidance that the software vendor, provider, or developer is
    expected to provide to stakeholders that describes:

    -   How to implement and operate the payment software securely.

    -   All configuration options available that can impact the security
        > of payment software, including those of the execution
        > environment and related system components.

    -   How to implement security updates.

    -   How and where to report security issues to the software vendor,
        > provider, and/or developer.

> *Note that the software vendor, provider, or developer may be expected
> to provide such guidance even when the specific settings:*

-   Cannot be controlled by the payment software vendor, provider, or
    > developer after the software is installed in a production
    > environment.

-   Are the responsibility of the implementing entity and not the
    > software vendor, provider, or developer.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Any other software, software functionality, or services necessary
    for a full implementation of the payment software, including but not
    limited to:

    -   Third-party and open-source software functions, libraries,
        > packages, components, services, and dependencies embedded in
        > or relied upon by the payment software to provide its intended
        > function.

    -   Features and functions of a supported platform or the execution
        > environment relied upon by the payment software for security
        > purposes.

    -   Third-party or custom tools and functions relied upon by the
        > payment software to satisfy security requirements in this
        > standard.

## Requirement Modules

> The PCI Secure Software Standard includes the concept of requirement
> "modules," which are distinct groups of requirements relating to a
> specific topic or type of software. Modules are intended to clarify
> how and when specific requirements apply to a given payment
> application or function.
>
> The requirements in this standard are organized into the following
> four requirement modules:

-   **Core Requirements ("Core Module")**: General security requirements
    that apply to all types of payment software regardless of software
    function, design, or underlying technology.

-   **Module A -- Account Data Protection Requirements ("Account Data
    Protection Module")**: Additional security requirements for payment
    software that store, process, or transmit account data.

-   **Module B -- Terminal Software Requirements ("Terminal Software
    Module")**: Additional security requirements for payment software
    specifically designed for deployment and operation on PCI-approved
    POI devices.

-   **Module C -- Web Software Requirements ("Web Software Module")**:
    Additional security requirements for payment software that uses
    Internet technologies, protocols, and languages to initiate or
    support electronic payment transactions.

### Requirement Module Applicability

> Each requirement module includes its own applicability criteria. It is
> expected that software assessed to this standard will include
> assessment to all applicable modules. At a minimum, payment software
> must be assessed to the Core Module. Additional modules are included
> in the assessment when the software meets the applicability criteria
> for those additional modules. Refer to the "Purpose and Scope" section
> within each additional module for more information on module
> applicability criteria.
>
> Be aware that some requirements defined within individual modules are
> extensions of Core Module requirements. Where such relationships are
> noted, the requirements in modules should be assessed in conjunction
> with their associated "Core" requirements.
>
> Also note that there may be certain requirements defined within a
> module that are similar to requirements in other modules or that may
> have broader applicability beyond the module(s) where they are
> defined. Unless otherwise noted, such requirements are required to be
> assessed only in the context of that module. With that said, such
> requirements are likely to be consolidated and/or applied more broadly
> in future updates to this standard. Entities are encouraged to
> identify and apply requirements that may be applicable to an entity's
> payment software regardless of whether the entity is required to
> assess to the module where such requirements are defined.

## Objective-Based Approach to Requirements

> The PCI Software Security Framework has adopted an "objective-based"
> approach to defining the security requirements in this standard. The
> PCI SSC acknowledges that there is no "one size fits all" approach to
> software security and that software vendors need flexibility to
> determine the software security controls and features most appropriate
> to address their specific business needs and risks.
>
> An "objective-based" approach is one that states security requirements
> as a desired security goal or outcome without necessarily specifying
> the method(s) to be used to achieve the desired goal. This approach
> enables entities to implement software security controls based on the
> risks identified by the software vendor for a given software
> application. For this approach to be successful, software vendors must
> possess a robust risk-management practice as an integral part of their
> software development lifecycle (SDLC) and be able to demonstrate how
> the implemented security controls are supported by the results of
> their risk identification and management practices. Without a robust
> risk-management practice in place and evidence available to support
> risk-based decision making, adherence to the requirements defined in
> this standard may be difficult to validate.

### Requirement Frequency and Rigor

> Given the nature of PCI SSC's objective-based approach to security
> requirements, many security requirements do not specify the level of
> rigor or frequency for periodic or recurring activities, such as the
> maximum period in which a security update must be provided to fix
> known vulnerabilities. In such cases, the software vendor may define
> the level of rigor or frequency appropriate for its business needs.
> The level of rigor or frequency chosen, however, must be supported by
> documented risk assessments and the resultant risk management
> decisions. Additionally, the software vendor must demonstrate that its
> implementation provides ongoing assurance that the software security
> controls and activities are effective and satisfy all relevant control
> objectives.

## Requirement Structure

> The security requirements defined in this standard are as follows:

-   **Control Objectives** -- The high-level security objectives that
    must be met. Control objectives are broadly stated to provide
    software vendors the flexibility to determine the best method(s) to
    achieve the stated objective. Regardless of the method(s) chosen, it
    is expected that the software vendor be able to produce clear and
    unambiguous evidence to demonstrate that the chosen method(s) is/are
    appropriate, sufficient, and properly implemented to satisfy the
    objective.

-   **Test Requirements** -- The expected assessment activities to be
    performed by an assessor to determine whether a specific control
    objective has been met. Test requirements are intended to provide
    both the software vendor and assessor with a common understanding of
    the tasks expected to be carried out by the assessor during testing.
    The specific method(s) used, the item(s) examined, and the personnel
    interviewed must be appropriate for the control objective being
    validated and for the software being assessed.

-   **Guidance** -- Additional information to help payment software
    vendors and assessors understand the intent of each control
    objective. The guidance may also include best practices that should
    be considered and examples of controls or methods that may be used
    to satisfy the control objective. Guidance is not intended to
    preclude other methods that a software vendor may use to meet a
    control objective, nor does it replace or amend the control
    objective to which it refers.

## Testing Methods

> To support the validation of their software to the requirements in
> this standard, software vendors are expected to produce evidence that
> they have satisfied the stated control objectives. The test
> requirements identified for each control objective describe the
> activities to be performed by the assessor to confirm that the
> software and/or software vendor have met the control objective(s).
> Test requirements include the following testing activities:

-   **Examine**: The assessor critically evaluates data evidence. Common
    examples include software design and architecture documents
    (electronic or physical), source code, configuration and metadata
    files, bug tracking data and other output from software development
    systems, and security-testing results. The choice of evidence that
    may be used to meet an "examination" requirement is deliberately
    left open for the tester to determine. However, it is a requirement
    of this standard that the software source code be made available for
    review as part of the assessment. It is not acceptable for an
    assessment report to be provided where no source code was examined
    or used in the process of performing the testing.

-   **Interview**: The assessor converses with individual personnel. The
    purposes of interviews include determining how an activity is
    performed, whether an activity is performed as defined, and whether
    personnel have particular knowledge or understanding of applicable
    policies, processes, responsibilities, or concepts.

-   **Test:** The assessor evaluates the software operation to analyze
    its characteristics and behavior in various scenarios. Unless
    otherwise stated, software "testing" must include functional testing
    using forensic tools and techniques. Examples of such tools and
    techniques include the use of automated static analysis security
    testing (SAST), dynamic analysis security testing (DAST),
    interactive application security testing (IAST), and software
    composition analysis (SCA) tools. Where adversarial testing is
    explicitly referenced, fuzzing and other penetration testing tools
    and techniques must be used to try and bypass software security
    controls or to cause the software to behave in unintended ways.

> The specific items or processes to be examined or tested, and the
> personnel to be interviewed should be appropriate for the control
> objective being validated and for each entity's organizational
> structure, culture, business practices, and software products. It is
> at the discretion of the assessor to determine the suitability or
> adequacy of the evidence provided by the entity to support each test
> requirement. Where bullets are specified in a control objective or
> test requirement, each bullet is expected to be validated as part of
> the assessment.
>
> When documenting the assessment results, the assessor identifies the
> testing activities performed and the result of each activity. While it
> is expected that an assessor performs all test requirements defined
> for each control objective, it may also be possible for a control
> objective to be validated using different or additional testing
> methods. In such cases, the assessor is expected to document why
> alternative testing methods were used and how those methods provide at
> least the same level of assurance as the stated test requirements.
> Where terms such as "periodic," "appropriate," and "reasonable" are
> used in the test requirement, it is the software providers
> responsibility to define and defend its decisions regarding the
> frequency, robustness, and maturity of the implemented controls or
> processes.

### Reliance on Third-Party Testing

> All test requirements are expected to be performed by the assessor. An
> assessor may choose, however, to rely on testing performed by a third-
> party to satisfy a test requirement, including the software provider.
> The assessor retains full responsibility for the testing activities
> and results, regardless of whether the testing is performed by the
> assessor, by the software provider, or by a third-party. Where
> third-party testing is relied upon by the assessor, the assessor must
> document and justify the following:

-   How the evidence provided by the third-party supports the same level
    of rigor as testing performed by the assessor, and

-   How the assessor verified that the third-party testing relied upon
    by the assessor is appropriate.

> Where an assessed entity's testing is to be used for the purposes of
> satisfying test requirements, the assessor must first verify the
> software vendor is Secure SLC-qualified^1^ before software vendor
> testing can be relied upon.

### Use of Sampling

> Where appropriate, the assessor may utilize sampling as part of the
> testing process in accordance with a documented sampling methodology.
> The assessor's sampling methodology must detail how samples are chosen
> and must be provided to PCI SSC upon submission of the Report on
> Validation (ROV).
>
> Sample selection must include a representative sample of all people,
> processes, and technologies in scope for the PCI Secure Software
> assessment. Sample sizes must be sufficiently large to demonstrate
> that the sample accurately reflects the characteristics of the larger
> population.
>
> In instances where the assessor's findings are based on a
> representative sample rather than the complete set of applicable
> items, the assessor must explicitly note this fact in the ROV, detail
> the items chosen as samples for the testing, and provide references to
> the applicable sections of the assessor's sampling methodology
> provided with the ROV. Where the assessor selects samples that do not
> align with the assessor's documented sampling methodology, the
> assessor must provide justification in the ROV for each instance where
> such samples are used.
>
> ^1^ Refer to the PCI Secure SLC Standard and its associated Program
> Guide for more information on Secure SLC qualification.

### Use of a Test Platform

> To ensure that software testing complies with this standard, it may be
> necessary for the software vendor to provide a test platform. A test
> platform is special test functionality that is either separate or
> absent from production-level code. The test platform must rely on as
> much of the intended production-level functionality as possible. The
> test platform serves only to provide a test framework that allows for
> software functionality to be exercised outside of a production-level
> deployment environment to verify the software's compliance to this
> standard. For example, elevated privileges or access capabilities may
> need to be granted for the purpose of providing run-time visibility
> into various facets of the software operation. Other examples include
> providing a test function to initiate a test transaction or to perform
> authentication functions. It is at the assessor's discretion to
> request any test functionality deemed necessary to verify the
> software's compliance with applicable requirements in this standard.

# Core Requirements

### Minimizing the Attack Surface

> ***The attack surface of the software is minimized. Confidentiality
> and integrity of all software critical assets are protected, and all
> unnecessary features and functions are removed or disabled.***

## Purpose and Scope

> This section (hereinafter referred to as the "Account Data Protection
> Module") defines security requirements and assessment procedures for
> software that stores, processes, or transmits Account Data. For the
> purposes of this module, account data is defined as follows:

+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| > **Account Data**                |                                  |
+===================================+==================================+
| > **Cardholder Data includes:**   | > **Sensitive Authentication     |
|                                   | > Data includes:**               |
+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| -   Primary Account Number (PAN)  | -   Full track data              |
|                                   |     > (magnetic-stripe data or   |
| -   Cardholder Name               |     > equivalent on a chip)      |
|                                   |                                  |
| -   Expiration Date               | -   CAV2/CVC2/CVV2/CID           |
|                                   |                                  |
| -   Service Code                  | -   PINs/PIN blocks              |
+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

> ***The primary account number (PAN) is the defining factor for
> cardholder data*.** If PAN is stored, processed, or transmitted or is
> otherwise present, the requirements in this module apply in addition
> to the Secure Software Core Requirements.
>
> The table on the following page illustrates commonly used elements of
> cardholder data and sensitive authentication data, whether storage of
> that data is permitted or prohibited, and whether this data needs to
> be protected. This table is not meant to be exhaustive, but it is
> presented to illustrate the different types of requirements that apply
> to each data element.

## Purpose and Scope

> This section (hereinafter referred to as the "Terminal Software
> Module" or "this module") defines security requirements and assessment
> procedures for payment software and applications that rely on the
> security features of PCI-approved POI devices to protect payment data.
> Software applications that are developed explicitly for deployment and
> execution on PCI-approved POI devices that do not meet the definition
> of Firmware as defined in the *PCI PIN Transaction Security (PTS)
> Point-of-Interaction (POI) Modular Security Requirements* (hereinafter
> referred to as the "PCI PTS POI Standard") are in scope for the
> requirements in this module.

## Background

> PCI-approved POI devices provide a high degree of confidentiality and
> integrity protection for payment data and payment transactions through
> the implementation of strict physical and logical protection
> mechanisms. Software that is deployed and executed on PCI-approved POI
> devices must not degrade or adversely affect the protection mechanisms
> provided by the device. In addition, the software must not provide
> features or functions that could allow those protection mechanisms to
> be circumvented or rendered ineffective.
>
> The requirements and assessment procedures defined in the Terminal
> Software Module have been developed to help ensure that terminal
> software protects payment data and does not introduce features,
> functions, or weaknesses that could enable an attacker to circumvent
> or render ineffective the protection mechanisms provided by the
> underlying PCI-approved POI devices upon which the software is
> intended to be deployed.

## Considerations

> Some assessment procedures in this module require examination of
> documentation describing the security features and functions of the
> underlying payment terminal. The terminal software vendor should work
> with their assessor(s), as well as the respective payment terminal
> vendors for each of the devices to be included as part of the terminal
> software evaluation, to identify and compile all device documentation
> needed for the terminal software evaluation. For more information
> about Secure Software assessment preparation and activities, refer to
> the *Secure Software Program Guide*.

## Purpose and Scope

> This section (hereinafter referred to as the "Web Software Module" or
> "this module") defines security requirements and assessment procedures
> for payment software and applications that use Internet technologies,
> protocols, and languages for the purposes of initiating or supporting
> electronic payment transactions. This includes both traditional
> (monolithic) and cloud-native payment applications, APIs, web
> services, microservices, serverless functions, GRPC, and any other
> methods used to make payment functions accessible or to conduct
> electronic payment transactions over the Internet. Any software-based
> features or functions that handle requests from Internet "clients" and
> generate responses to initiate or support an electronic payment
> transaction are in scope for the requirements in this module.

## Considerations

> Web software architectures can be extremely complex and involve
> features and functions that are provided by different entities and may
> be distributed across different geographic locations. The security
> issues affecting web software can vary significantly. The security
> requirements defined within this web module do not address all risks
> affecting web-based payment software. They are intended as a minimum
> set of security characteristics, controls, features, and capabilities
> that web-based payment software must possess to defend itself from the
> most common attacks on web software.
>
> While many of the control objectives defined in this standard protect
> against new and/or novel attacks beyond the most common techniques,
> attacks will inevitably evolve or emerge that will require new methods
> or approaches to mitigate them. It is ultimately the responsibility of
> payment software vendors, providers, developers, and suppliers to keep
> abreast of evolving attacks techniques and to implement appropriate
> security controls to enable their software to defend against such
> attacks.
