> Standard (PCI DSS) provides a baseline of technical and operational
> requirements, organized into 12 principal requirements and detailed
> security requirements. PCI DSS has been developed to secure payment
> account data that is stored, processed, and/or transmitted by
> merchants, service providers, and other organizations (referred to,
> collectively, as "organizations" hereafter). By its comprehensive
> nature, PCI DSS provides a large amount of security information -- so
> much information that some people responsible for security of payment
> account data may wonder where to start. Toward this end, the PCI
> Security Standards Council provides the Prioritized Approach to help
> organizations understand how they can reduce risk earlier in their PCI
> DSS journey.
>
> **What Is the Prioritized Approach?**
>
> The Prioritized Approach maps all PCI DSS requirements into six
> risk-based security milestones that are intended to help organizations
> incrementally protect against the highest risk factors and escalating
> threats while on the road to PCI DSS compliance. No single milestone
> in the Prioritized Approach provides comprehensive security but
> following its guidelines will help organizations to secure payment
> account data more quickly.
>
> The Prioritized Approach and its milestones (described on page 2) are
> intended to provide the following benefits:

-   Provides a roadmap that an organization can use to address its risks
    in

-   Allows for "quick wins" using a pragmatic approach

-   Supports financial and operational planning

-   Promotes objective and measurable progress indicators

-   Helps promote consistency among assessors

> **Objectives of the Prioritized Approach**
>
> The Prioritized Approach provides a roadmap of PCI DSS requirements
> based on the risk associated with storing, processing, and/or
> transmitting payment account data. The roadmap helps organizations to
> prioritize efforts to achieve compliance, establish milestones, and
> lower the risk of payment account data breaches sooner in the
> compliance process.
>
> Additionally, the roadmap helps acquirers objectively measure
> compliance activities and risk reduction by organizations. The
> Prioritized Approach was developed after reviewing data from actual
> breaches and feedback from Qualified Security Assessors, forensic
> investigators, and the PCI Security Standards Council Board of
> Advisors. The roadmap is not intended as a substitute, shortcut, or
> stop-gap approach to PCI DSS compliance, nor is it a one-size-fits-all
> framework applicable to every organization.
