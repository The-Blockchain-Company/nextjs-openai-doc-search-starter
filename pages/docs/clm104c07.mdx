### *(Rev. 10880, Issued: 08-06-21, Effective: 11-08-21, Implementation: 11-08-21)*

> See Business Requirements at
> ***[https:[//w](http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-)ww[.cms.gov/Regulations-and-](http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-)]{.underline}
> [Guidance/Guidance/Transmittals/Downloads/R20CP.pdf.]{.underline}***
>
> There are three situations in which a SNF may submit a claim for Part
> B services. These are identified in subsections A through C below.
>
> No bill is required when:

-   The patient is not enrolled under Part B;

-   Payment was made or will be made by the Public Health Service, VA,
    > or other governmental entity;

-   Workers\' compensation has paid or will pay the bill; or

-   Payment was made by liability, no-fault insurance, group health
    > plan, or a large group health plan.

## A - Beneficiaries in a Part B Inpatient Stay (Part B Residents)

> A Part B inpatient stay includes services furnished to inpatients
> whose benefit days are exhausted, or who are not entitled to have
> payment made for services under Part A. A more detailed description of
> services covered for beneficiaries in a Part B stay is *found* at
>
> §10.1 -- Billing for Inpatient Services Paid Under Part B.

## B - Outpatient Services

> Covered Part B services rendered to beneficiaries who are not
> inpatients of a SNF are considered SNF outpatient services. They
> include the services listed in §10.1 below as well as additional
> services described in the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 8,
> \"Coverage of Extended Care (SNF) Services Under Hospital Insurance,\"
> §§80 and Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 6, \"Hospital
> Services Covered Under Part B.\" Detailed instructions for billing are
> located in §10.2 -- Billing for Outpatient SNF Services.

## C - Beneficiaries in a Part A Covered Stay

> SNFs are required to consolidate billing to their intermediary for
> their covered Medicare inpatient services. However, certain services
> rendered to SNF inpatients are excluded from the SNF Prospective
> Payment System (PPS) reimbursement and are also excluded from
> consolidated billing by the SNF. Those services must be billed to Part
> B by the rendering provider and not by the SNF (except screening and
> preventive services as described in the next paragraph.) A list of
> services excluded from consolidated billing is
>
> found in the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 6, \"SNF
> Inpatient Part A Billing,\" §§20 -- 20.4.
>
> Screening and preventive services are not included in the SNF PPS
> amount but may be paid separately under Part B for Part A patients who
> also have Part B coverage.
>
> Screening and preventive services are covered only under Part B. Only
> the SNF may bill for screening and preventive services under Part B
> for its covered Part A inpatients. Bill type 22X is used *in billing
> screening and preventive services* for beneficiaries in a covered Part
> A stay and for beneficiaries that are Part B residents. TOB 23x is
> used for SNF outpatients or for beneficiaries not in the SNF or DPU.
> The SNF must provide the service or obtain it under arrangements.
>
> Coverage, billing and payment guidelines are found in the Medicare
> Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 18, \"Preventive and Screening
> Services;\" Chapter 17, \"Drugs and Biologicals;\" and the Medicare
> Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, \"Covered Medical and Other Health
> Services,\" §50.4.4.2.
>
> There are certain medical and other health services for which payment
> may not be made to a SNF. Most of these are professional services
> performed by physicians and other practitioners. These services are
> always billed to the Medicare Part B *MAC*. Others are services that
> have been determined to require a hospital setting to assure
> beneficiary safety. *Part A MAC* shared systems receive an annual file
> listing these non-payable HCPCS in November, and, if necessary, a
> quarterly update via a one*-*time*-*only notification.
>
> Physicians, non-physician practitioners, and suppliers billing the
> *Part B MAC*, and providers billing the *Part A MAC* should consult
> the CMS Web site at
> [[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SNFConsolidatedBilling/]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SNFConsolidatedBilling/)
> for lists of separately billable services.

# - Billing for Inpatient SNF Services Paid Under Part B

## (Rev. 980, Issued: 06-14-06, Effective: 10-01-06, Implementation: 10-02-06)

> When the beneficiary in a Medicare-certified SNF is not entitled to
> Part A benefits, limited benefits are provided under Part B. Reasons
> for not being entitled to have payment made under Part A are that:

-   The beneficiary does not have Medicare Part A Health Insurance;

-   The beneficiary is not in a Medicare-certified bed;

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The inpatient stay is not at a covered level of care and no Part A
    > program payment is possible; or

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The inpatient stay is not covered because the beneficiary did not
    > have a 3-day qualifying stay.

> When no Part A program payment is possible, some or all services may
> be medically necessary and can be covered as ancillary services under
> Part B. The following services may be billed by the SNF or the
> rendering provider or supplier under an arrangement with the SNF:

-   Diagnostic x-ray tests, diagnostic laboratory tests, and other
    > diagnostic tests;

-   X-ray, radium, and radioactive isotope therapy, including materials
    > and services of technicians;

-   Surgical dressings, and splints, casts, and other devices used for
    > reduction of fractures and dislocations;

-   Prosthetic devices (other than dental) which replace all or part of
    > an internal body organ (including contiguous tissue), or all or
    > part of the function of a permanently inoperative or
    > malfunctioning internal body organ, including replacement or
    > repairs of such devices;

-   Leg, arm, back, and neck braces, trusses, and artificial legs, arms,
    > and eyes including adjustments, repairs, and replacements required
    > because of breakage, wear, loss, or a change in the patient's
    > physical condition;

-   Outpatient physical therapy, outpatient speech-language pathology
    > services, and outpatient occupational therapy (see Pub. 100-02
    > Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 15, "Covered Medical and
    > Other Health Services," §220 and 230.

-   Screening mammography services;

-   Screening pap smears;

-   Influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, and hepatitis B vaccines;

-   Colorectal screening;

-   Bone mass measurements;

-   Diabetes self-management;

-   Prostate screening;

-   Ambulance services;

-   Hemophilia clotting factors for hemophilia patients competent to use
    > these factors without supervision);

-   Immunosuppressive drugs;

-   Oral anti-cancer drugs;

-   Oral drug prescribed for use as an acute anti-emetic used as part of
    > an anti- cancer chemotherapeutic regimen; and

-   Epoetin Alfa (EPO).

> See chapter 6 of Pub. 100-02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual for a
> discussion of the circumstances under which the above services may be
> covered as Part B Inpatient services.
>
> Coverage rules for these services are described in Pub. 100-02,
> Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapters 10, 14, or 15. Specific
> billing instructions are found in the Medicare Claims Processing
> Manual, Chapters 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, or 23.
>
> Outpatient physical therapy, outpatient speech-language pathology
> services, and outpatient occupational therapy (see Chapter 10, §§60)
> are billable services for SNF inpatients not in a Part A stay.
> However, they must be billed by the SNF even when another entity
> renders the services under an arrangement with the SNF.
>
> The determination of whether to use TOB 22x or 23x is a function of
> the type of facility in which the beneficiary resides. If the facility
> is not Medicare-certified, it is not a SNF, although it may have a
> Medicare-certified distinct part unit (DPU). If the beneficiary is in
> a SNF or SNF DPU, Part B services must be billed on TOB 22x.
>
> All services rendered to SNF patients residing in the
> non-Medicare-certified portion of an institution that is not primarily
> engaged in the provision of skilled services must be billed on TOB
> 23x. Beneficiaries residing in such portions of the facility are
> considered outpatients of the SNF for Medicare purposes.
>
> If the entire facility qualifies as a Medic are-certified SNF, all
> Part B services rendered to residents are billed on TOB 22x.

# -- Billing for Outpatient SNF Services

## (Rev. 229, Issued 07-20-04 Effective/Implementation 08-19-04) SNF-529

> Coverage is available for all of the services described in §10.1.
> However, beneficiaries not in the Medicare-certified Distinct Part
> Unit (DPU) are not required to have therapy services (physical
> therapy, occupational therapy, and speech language pathology) billed
> by the SNF. Therapy services need only be bundled to the SNF for those
> SNF residents in a Medicare-certified DPU. For additional information
> see Chapter 6, SNF Inpatient Part A Billing, §20.5 Therapy Services.

# - Determining How Much to Charge Before Billing Is Submitted

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) SNF-529.1

> The SNF may be able to determine from the SNF\'s records, from a
> transferring hospital, or from the patient the extent to which the
> Part B cash deductible is met. The SNF may charge the patient for the
> unmet deductible and coinsurance. The SNF should submit a bill even if
> no payment can be made because the unmet Part B cash deductible
> exceeds
>
> the covered charges. In addition, a bill is required when the SNF
> becomes aware that no bill has been submitted for covered services
> even though the time limitation for filing has expired.

# - Charges for Services Provided in Different Accounting Years

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) SNF-529.2

> The SNF must not put charges for services provided in different
> accounting years on the same bill. At the end of the SNF\'s accounting
> year, the SNF should submit a bill that contains the charges for all
> services furnished to the patient since the last bill through the end
> of the year. The SNF should include bills in which the deductible
> covers all charges. All services furnished in the succeeding
> accounting year should be placed on a separate bill. Complete all
> items on the subsequent bill.

# - General Payment Rules and Application of Part B Deductible and Coinsurance

## (Rev. 685, Issued: 09-23-05, Effective: 12-27-05, Implementation: 12-27-05) SNF-529.3

> Section
> [[1888(e)(9)]{.underline}](http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1888.htm#e9)
> of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires that the payment amount
> for Part B SNF services shall be the amount prescribed in the
> otherwise applicable fee schedule. Thus, where a fee schedule exists
> for the type of service, the fee amount will be paid. Where a fee does
> not exist on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) the particular
> service is priced based on cost. This is also true for all
> "carrier-priced" codes on the MPFS, but not for services paid on the
> Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Fee Schedule. All lab services missing
> fees are to be gap-filled. Some specific services continue to be paid
> on a cost basis and are specifically stated in the sections below
> where cost applies.
>
> Where payment is made under a fee schedule, the beneficiary\'s
> deductible and coinsurance are based on the approved amount. Where
> payment is made on a cost basis, deductible and coinsurance are based
> on charges for the service.

# 20 - Use of Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS)

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) SNF-530, SNF-530.3

> HCPCS is required for reporting all SNF services paid under Part B,
> whether paid by Medicare fee schedules or by some other mechanism. A
> description of HCPCS codes is found in the Medicare Claims Processing
> Manual, Chapter 23.
>
> The SNF should use the CPT-4 portion of HCPCS and/or Level II as
> directed by the manual sections applicable to the Part B service that
> is being billed. Currently, HCPCS codes are not applicable on SNF Part
> A inpatient claims.
>
> For Part B claims, there are separate codes for the technical
> component, professional component, and/or complete procedure.
> Generally, SNFs bill for the technical component only, using the code
> that describes the procedure provided.
>
> There may be specific rules for use of HCPCS codes for specific types
> of services (e.g., SNF\'s must bill global services for therapies).
> These will be described in the manual sections for the applicable
> service.
>
> Revenue codes, HCPCS codes, line item dates of service, and units are
> required. Charges must be reported by HCPCS code. If the same revenue
> code applies to two or more HCPCS codes, the SNF should repeat the
> revenue code and show the line item date of service, units and charge
> for each HCPCS code on a separate line.

# - Billing Formats

## (Rev. 3053, Issued: 08-28-14, Effective: ICD-10: Upon Implementation of ICD-10 ASC-X12: 01-01-12, Implementation ICD-10: Upon Implementation of ICD-10; ASC X12: 09-30-14)

> The SNF must use the current ASC X12 837 institutional claim format or
> if permissible Form CMS-1450 to bill for covered Part B services.
> Instructions for those formats are located in the Medicare Claims
> Processing Manual, Chapter 25, \"Completing and Processing the
> CMS-1450 Data Set.\"

# - Frequency of Billing for Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs)

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) SNF-561

> SNFs must bill repetitive Part B services on a single individual
> monthly bill (or at the conclusion of treatment). This avoids Medicare
> processing costs in holding such bills for monthly review and reduces
> bill processing costs for relatively small claims. See the Medicare
> Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 1, \"General Billing Requirements,\"
>
> §50.2.2, for additional instructions when billing repetitive services
> and billing repetitive services during an inpatient stay.
>
> Other one-time Part B services must be billed upon completion of the
> services.

# - Guidelines for Submitting Corrected Bills

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) SNF-562, SNF-562.A

> When a SNF or intermediary discovers an error on an original bill,
> there are three methods for correcting the bill depending on the type
> of error. The SNF or intermediary may submit a late charge bill, an
> adjustment request, or maintain a log of charges. Each of the methods
> and appropriate use are explained in the Medicare Claims Processing
> Manual, Chapter 1, \"General Billing Requirements,\" §130.

# - Billing Part B Rehabilitation Services

## (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) SNF-515.6

> Part B rehabilitation services other than audiology services must be
> billed by the SNF for Part A inpatients, for Part B residents (those
> not in a covered Part A stay) and for outpatients. Effective January
> 1, 1999, the MPFS is the payment basis for these services.
>
> The Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 5, \"Part B Outpatient
> Rehabilitation and CORF Services,\" contains instructions for billing,
> payment, and applicable HCPCS codes.

# - Audiologic Tests

## (Rev. 980, Issued: 06-14-06, Effective: 10-01-06, Implementation: 10-02-06)

> Audiologic tests will generally be billed to the carrier by the
> provider of service. For tests that include both a professional
> component and technical component, the SNF may elect to bill the
> technical component to the intermediary, but is not required to bill
> the service. See Pub 100-02 chapter 15, section 80.3 for further
