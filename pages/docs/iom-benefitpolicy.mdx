# - Covered Inpatient Hospital Services Covered Under Part A

> **(Rev. 234, Issued: 03-10-17, Effective: 01-01-16, Implementation:
> 06-12-17)**
>
> Patients covered under hospital insurance are entitled to have payment
> made on their behalf for inpatient hospital services. (Inpatient
> hospital services do not include extended care services provided by
> hospitals pursuant to swing bed approvals. See Pub.
> [[100-02,]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/bp102c08.pdf)
> [[Chapter 8, §10.3, \"Hospital Providers of Extended Care
> Services.\").]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/bp102c08.pdf)
> However, both inpatient hospital and inpatient SNF benefits are
> provided under Part A - Hospital Insurance Benefits for the Aged and
> Disabled, of Title XVIII).
>
> Additional information concerning the following topics can be found in
> the following chapters of this manual:

-   [[Benefit Period is found in Chapter
    3]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/bp102c03.pdf)

-   [[Counting Inpatient Days is found in Chapter

> Blood must be furnished on a day which counts as a day of inpatient
> hospital services to be covered as a Part A service and to count
> toward the blood deductible. Thus, blood is not covered under Part A
> and does not count toward the Part A blood deductible when furnished
> to an inpatient after the inpatient has exhausted all benefit days in
> a benefit period, or where the individual has elected not to use
> lifetime reserve days. However, where the patient is discharged on
> their first day of entitlement or on the hospital\'s first day of
> participation, the hospital is permitted to submit a billing form with
> no accommodation charge, but with ancillary charges including blood.
>
> The records for all Medicare hospital inpatient discharges are
> maintained in CMS for statistical analysis and use in determining
> future Prospective Payment System (PPS) Diagnosis Related Group (DRG)
> classifications and rates.
>
> Non-PPS hospitals do not pay for noncovered services generally
> excluded from coverage in the Medicare Program. This may result in
> denial of a part of the billed charges or in denial of the entire
> admission, depending upon circumstance. In PPS hospitals, the
> following are also possible:

1.  In appropriately admitted cases where a noncovered procedure was
    performed, denied services may result in payment of a different DRG
    (i.e., one which excludes payment for the noncovered procedure); or

2.  In appropriately admitted cases that become cost outlier cases,
    denied services may lead to denial of some or all of an outlier
    payment.

> The following examples illustrate this principle. If care is
> noncovered because a patient does not need to be hospitalized, the A/B
> MAC Part A denies the admission and makes no Part A (i.e., PPS)
> payment unless paid under limitation on liability. Under limitation on
> liability, Medicare payment may be made when the provider **and** the
> beneficiary were **not** aware the services were not necessary and
> could not reasonably be expected to know that the services were not
> necessary. For detailed instructions, see [[Pub. 100-04,
> Medicare]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/clm104c30.pdf)
> [[Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 30,\"Limitation on Liability\"
> section
> 20]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/clm104c30.pdf).
> If a patient is appropriately hospitalized but receives (beyond
> routine services) only noncovered care, the admission is denied.
>
> **NOTE:** The A/B MAC Part A does not deny an admission that includes
> covered care, even if noncovered care was also rendered. Under PPS,
> Medicare assumes that it is paying for **only** the covered care
> rendered whenever covered services needed to treat and/or diagnose the
> illness were in fact provided.
>
> If a noncovered procedure is provided along with covered nonroutine
> care, a DRG change rather than an admission denial might occur. If
> noncovered procedures are elevating costs into the cost outlier
> category, outlier payment is denied in whole or in part.
>
> When the hospital is included in PPS, most of the subsequent
> discussion regarding coverage of inpatient hospital services is
> relevant only in the context of determining the appropriateness of
> admissions, which DRG, if any, to pay, and the appropriateness of
> payment for any outlier cases.
>
> If a patient receives items or services in excess of, or more
> expensive than, those for which payment can be made, payment is made
> only for the covered items or services or for only the appropriate
> prospective payment amount. This provision applies not only to
> inpatient services, but also to all hospital services under Parts A
> and B of the program. If the items or services were requested by the
> patient, the hospital may charge him or her the difference between the
> amount customarily charged for the services requested and the amount
> customarily charged for covered services.
>
> An **inpatient** is a person who has been admitted to a hospital for
> bed occupancy for purposes of receiving inpatient hospital services
> (see §10.2 below). Generally, a patient is considered an inpatient if
> formally admitted as inpatient with the expectation that he or she
> will require hospital care that is expected to span at least two
> midnights and occupy a bed even though it later develops that the
> patient can be discharged or transferred to another hospital and not
> actually use a hospital bed overnight.
>
> The physician or other practitioner responsible for a patient\'s care
> at the hospital is also responsible for deciding whether the patient
> should be admitted as an inpatient.
>
> Physicians should use the expectation of the patient to require
> hospital care that spans at least two midnights period as a benchmark,
> i.e., they should order admission for patients who are expected to
> require a hospital stay that crosses two midnights and the medical
> record supports that reasonable expectation. However, the decision to
> admit a patient is a complex medical judgment which can be made only
> after the physician has considered a number of factors, including the
> patient\'s medical history and current medical needs, the types of
> facilities available to inpatients and to outpatients, the hospital\'s
> by-laws and admissions policies, and the relative appropriateness of
> treatment in each setting. Factors to be considered when making the
> decision to admit include such things as:

-   The severity of the signs and symptoms exhibited by the patient;

-   The medical predictability of something adverse happening to the
    patient;

-   The need for diagnostic studies that appropriately are outpatient
    services (i.e., their performance does not ordinarily require the
    patient to remain at the hospital for 24 hours or more) to assist in
    assessing whether the patient should be admitted; and

-   The availability of diagnostic procedures at the time when and at
    the location where the patient presents.

> Admissions of particular patients are not covered or noncovered solely
> on the basis of the length of time the patient actually spends in the
> hospital. In certain specific situations coverage of services on an
> inpatient or outpatient basis is determined by the following rules:
>
> **Minor Surgery or Other Treatment** - When patients with known
> diagnoses enter a hospital for a specific minor surgical procedure or
> other treatment that is expected to keep them in the hospital for only
> a few hours (less than 24), they are considered **outpatients** for
> coverage purposes regardless of: the hour they came to the hospital,
> whether they used a bed, and whether they remained in the hospital
> past midnight.
>
> **Renal Dialysis** - Renal dialysis treatments are usually covered
> only as outpatient services but may under certain circumstances be
> covered as inpatient services depending on the patient\'s condition.
> Patients staying at home, who are ambulatory, whose conditions are
> stable and who come to the hospital for routine chronic dialysis
> treatments, and not for a diagnostic workup or a change in therapy,
> are considered outpatients. On the other hand, patients undergoing
> short-term dialysis until their kidneys recover from an acute illness
> (acute dialysis), or persons with borderline renal failure who develop
> acute renal failure every time they have an illness and require
> dialysis (episodic dialysis) are usually inpatients. A patient may
> begin dialysis as an inpatient and then progress to an outpatient
> status.
>
> Under original Medicare, the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO),
> for each hospital is responsible for deciding, during review of
> inpatient admissions on a case-by-case basis, whether the admission
> was medically necessary. Medicare law authorizes the QIO to make these
> judgments, and the judgments are binding for purposes of Medicare
> coverage. In making these judgments, however, QIOs consider only the
> medical evidence which was available to the physician at the time an
> admission decision had to be made. They do not take into account other
> information (e.g., test results) which became available only after
> admission, except in cases where considering the post-admission
> information would support a finding that an admission was medically
> necessary.
>
> Refer to chapters 4 and 7 of [[Pub. 100-10, Quality Improvement
> Organization
> Manual]{.underline}](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/CMS019035.html)
> with regard to initial determinations for these services. The QIO will
> review the swing bed services in these PPS hospitals as well.
>
> **NOTE:** When patients requiring extended care services are admitted
> to beds in a hospital, they are considered inpatients of the hospital.
> In such cases, the services furnished in the hospital will not be
> considered extended care services, and payment may not be made under
> the program for such services unless the services are extended care
> services furnished pursuant to a swing bed agreement granted to the
> hospital by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

> **A3-3101.1.B, HO-210.1.B**
>
> A private room is medically necessary where isolation of a beneficiary
> is required to avoid jeopardizing their health or recovery, or that of
> other patients who are likely to be alarmed or disturbed by the
> beneficiary\'s symptoms or treatment or subjected to infection by the
> beneficiary\'s communicable disease. For example, communicable
> diseases, heart attacks, cerebra-vascular accidents, and psychotic
> episodes may require isolation of the patient for certain periods.
> (See
> [[§10.1.3]{.underline}](#medical-necessity---admission-required-and-only-private-rooms-available)
> below concerning medical necessity not based on need for isolation).
>
> In establishing the medical necessity for isolation, the date of the
> physician\'s written statement is not controlling, nor is the presence
> of a written statement. The crucial question is whether a private room
> was ordered by the physician because it is necessary for the health of
> the patient himself or herself or of other patients. In the absence of
> such an order, a patient who requested the room with knowledge of the
> amount of the charge may be charged appropriately, even though a
> physician subsequently submits a statement that the room was medically
> necessary. There may be cases in which the physician\'s
>
> written statement of medical necessity, though dated after admission

# - Medical Necessity - Admission Required and Only Private Rooms Available

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.1.C, HO-210.1.C**
>
> A private room is considered to be medically necessary even though the
> beneficiary\'s condition does not require isolation if he/she needs
> immediate hospitalization (i.e., the beneficiary\'s medical condition
> is such that hospitalization cannot be deferred) and the hospital has
> no semiprivate or ward accommodations available at the time of
> admission.
>
> It need not be considered whether semiprivate or ward accommodations
> were available in some other accessible hospital. Where medical
> necessity exists, the provider may not charge the beneficiary a
> private room differential until semiprivate or ward accommodations
> become available. Thereafter the provider may transfer the patient to
> the nonprivate accommodations, or allow them to continue occupancy of
> the private room, subject to an appropriate differential charge
> (described in [[§10.1.1]{.underline}](#accommodations---general)
> above) if they request the private room with knowledge of the amount
> of the charge.
>
> If the admission could be deferred until semiprivate or ward

# - Charges for Deluxe Private Room

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.1.D, HO-210.1.D**
>
> Beneficiaries found to need a private room (either because they need
> isolation for medical reasons or because they need immediate admission
> when no other accommodations are available) may be assigned to any of
> the provider\'s private rooms. They do not have the right to insist on
> the private room of their choice, but their preferences should be
> given the same consideration as if they were paying all provider
> charges themselves. The program does not, under any circumstances, pay
> for personal comfort items. Thus, the program does not pay for deluxe
> accommodations and/or services. These would include a suite, or a room
> substantially more spacious than is required for treatment, or
> specially equipped or decorated, or serviced for the comfort and
>
> convenience of persons willing to pay a differential for such
> amenities. If the beneficiary (or representative) requests such deluxe
> accommodations, the provider should advise that there will be a
> charge, not covered by Medicare, of a specified amount per day (not
> exceeding the differential defined in the next sentence); and may
> charge the beneficiary that amount for each day he/she occupies the
> deluxe accommodations. The maximum amount the provider may charge the
> beneficiary for such accommodations is the differential between the
> most prevalent private room rate at the time of admission and the
> customary charge for the room occupied. Beneficiaries may not be
> charged this differential if they (or their representative) do not
> request the deluxe accommodations.
>
> The beneficiary may not be charged such a differential in private room
> rates if that differential is based on factors other than personal
> comfort items. Such factors might include differences between older
> and newer wings, proximity to lounge, elevators or nursing stations,
> desirable view, etc. Such rooms are standard 1-bed units and not
> deluxe rooms for purposes of these instructions, even though the
> provider may call them deluxe and have a higher customary charge for
> them. No additional charge may be imposed upon the beneficiary who is
> assigned to a room that may be somewhat more desirable because of
> these factors.

# - All Private Room Providers

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.E, HO-210.1.E**

# - Wards

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.1.F, HO-210.1.F**
>
> The law contemplates that Medicare patients should not be assigned to
> ward accommodations except at the patient\'s request or for a reason
> consistent with the purposes of the health insurance program.
>
> When ward accommodations are furnished at the patient\'s request or
> for a reason determined to be consistent with the program\'s purposes,
> payment will be based on the average per diem cost of routine services
> (see [§10.1.1]{.underline} above). Where ward accommodations are
> assigned for other reasons, the law provides what may be a substantial
> penalty. (See
> [[§10.1.6.2]{.underline}](#assignment-not-consistent-with-program-purposes)
> below).
>
> Any request by the patient (or relative or other person responsible
> for his or her affairs) for ward accommodations must be obtained by
> the provider in writing and kept in its files.

# - Assignment Consistent With Program Purposes

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.1.F.1, HO-210.1.F.1**
>
> It is considered to be consistent with the program\'s purposes to
> assign the patient to ward accommodations if all semiprivate
> accommodations are occupied, or the facility has no semiprivate
> accommodations. However, the patient must be moved to semiprivate
> accommodations if they become available during the stay.
>
> Some hospitals have a policy of placing in wards all patients who do
> not have private physicians. Such a practice may be consistent with
> the purposes of the program if the A/B MAC (A) determines that the
> ward assignment inures to the benefit of the patient. In making this
> determination, the principal consideration is whether the assignment
> is likely to result in better medical treatment of the patient (e.g.,
> it facilitates necessary medical and nursing supervision and
> treatment). The A/B MAC (A) should ask a provider having this policy
> to submit a statement describing how the assignments are made, their
> purpose, and the effect on the care of patients so assigned.
>
> If the A/B MAC (A) makes a favorable determination on a practice
> affecting all ward assignments of Medicare patients in the
> institution, a reference should be made on the appropriate billing
> form for patients to whom the hospital assigned a ward pursuant to
> such practice.

# - Assignment Not Consistent With Program Purposes

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.1.F.2, HO-210.1.F.2**
>
> It is not consistent with the purposes of the law to assign a patient
> ward accommodation based on their social or economic status, their
> national origin, race, or religion, or their entitlement to benefits
> as a Medicare patient, or any other such discriminatory reason. It is
> also inconsistent with the purposes of the law to assign patients to
> ward accommodations merely for the convenience or financial advantage
> of the institution.
>
> Additionally, under DRGs, there no longer is a reduction to payment or
> an adjustment to the end of year settlement.

# - Charges

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.1.G, HO-210.1.G**
>
> Customary charges means amounts which the hospital or skilled nursing

> services and accommodations. The most prevalent rate or charge is the
> rate that applies to the greatest number of semiprivate or private
> beds in the institution.

    > CAH.

> Time as an outpatient at the CAH does not count towards the 96 hour

B.  **Inpatient Order:** A Medicare beneficiary is considered an
    inpatient of a hospital if formally admitted as an inpatient
    pursuant to an order for inpatient admission by an ordering
    practitioner. As stated in the [[FY 2014 IPPS Final
    Rule]{.underline},](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-08-19/pdf/2013-18956.pdf)
    78 FR 50908 and 50941, and as conveyed in [[42 CFR
    482.24]{.underline},](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=03bf4f31cab9d31b0efda70dad773d85&mc=true&node=pt42.5.482&rgn=div5&se42.5.482_124)
    if the order is not properly documented in the medical record prior
    to discharge, the hospital should not submit a claim for Part A
    payment. Meeting the two midnight benchmark does not, in itself,
    render a beneficiary an inpatient or serve to qualify them for
    payment under Part A. Rather, as provided in Medicare regulations, a
    beneficiary is considered an inpatient (and Part A payment may only
    be made) if they are formally admitted as such pursuant to an order
    for inpatient admission by an ordering practitioner.

> With regard to the time of discharge, a Medicare beneficiary is
> considered a patient of the hospital until the effectuation of
> activities typically specified by the ordering practitioner as having
> to occur prior to discharge (e.g., "discharge after supper" or
> "discharge after voids"). Thus, discharge itself can but does not
> always coincide exactly with the time that the discharge order is
> written, rather it occurs when the ordering practitioner's order for
> discharge is effectuated.

1.  **Content:** The ordering practitioner's order contains the
    > instruction that the beneficiary should be formally admitted for
    > hospital inpatient care. The order must specify admission for
    > inpatient services. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs)
    > must adhere to the admission requirements specified in
    > [[42]{.underline}](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=03bf4f31cab9d31b0efda70dad773d85&mc=true&node=pt42.2.412&rgn=div5&se42.2.412_1622)

    > The two midnight benchmark does not apply in IRFs.

2.  **Qualifications of the ordering/admitting practitioner:** The order
    > must be furnished by a physician or other practitioner ("ordering
    > practitioner") who is:

> \(a\) licensed by the state to admit inpatients to hospitals, (b)
> granted privileges by the hospital to admit inpatients to that
> specific facility, and (c) knowledgeable about the patient's hospital
> course, medical plan of care, and current condition at the time of
> admission. See section (B)(3) for a discussion of the requirements to
> be knowledgeable about the patient's hospital course. The ordering
> practitioner makes the determination of medical necessity for
> inpatient care and renders the admission decision. The ordering
> practitioner is not required to write the order but must authenticate
> (sign, or in the case of an initial order (under (B)(2)(a)) or a
> verbal order (under (B)(2)(b)), countersign) the order reflecting that
> he or she has made the decision to admit the patient for inpatient
> services.
>
> The admission decision (order) may not be delegated to another
> individual who is not authorized by the state to admit patients, or
> has not been granted admitting privileges by the hospital\'s medical
> staff. However, a medical resident, physician assistant, nurse
> practitioner, or other non-physician practitioner may act as a proxy

> law to admit patients and the requirements outlined below are met
> ([[FY 14 IPPS Final
> Rule]{.underline}](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-08-19/pdf/2013-18956.pdf)

    > In authenticating (countersigning) the order, the ordering
    > practitioner approves and accepts responsibility for the admission
    > decision. This process may also be used for practitioners (such as
    > emergency department physicians) who do not have admitting
    > privileges but are authorized by the hospital to issue temporary
    > or "bridge" inpatient admission orders.

b.  **Verbal orders-** At some hospitals, individuals who lack the
    > authority to admit inpatients under state laws and hospital
    > by‐laws (such as a registered nurse) may nonetheless enter the
    > inpatient admission order as a verbal order. In these cases, the
    > ordering practitioner directly communicates the inpatient
    > admission order to staff as a verbal (not standing) order, and the
    > ordering practitioner need not separately record the order to
    > admit. Following discussion with and at the direction of the
    > ordering practitioner, a verbal order for inpatient admission may
    > be documented by an individual who is not qualified to admit
    > patients in his or her own right, as long as that documentation
    > (transcription) of the order for inpatient admission is in
    > accordance with state law including; scope‐ of‐practice laws,
    > hospital policies, and medical staff bylaws, rules, and
    > regulations. In this case, the staff receiving the verbal order
    > must document the verbal order in the medical record at the time
    > it is received. The order must identify the ordering practitioner
    > and must be authenticated (countersigned) by the ordering
    > practitioner promptly and prior to discharge. Example: "Admit to
    > inpatient per Dr. Smith" would be considered an acceptable method
    > of identifying the ordering practitioner and would meet the verbal
    > order requirement if the verbal order (1) is appropriately
    > documented in the medical record by the individual receiving the
    > verbal order when the order is received; and (2) is authenticated
    > (countersigned) by Dr. Smith promptly, prior to discharge.

c.  **Standing orders and protocols -** The inpatient admission order
    > cannot be a standing order. While Medicare's rules do not prohibit
    > use of a protocol or algorithm that is part of a protocol, only
    > the ordering practitioner, or a resident or other practitioner
    > acting on his or her behalf under section

> (B)(2)(a) can make and take responsibility for the inpatient admission
> decision.

d.  **Commencement of inpatient status** - Inpatient status begins at
    > the time of formal admission by the hospital pursuant to the
    > order, including an initial order (under (B)(2)(a)) or a verbal
    > order (under (B)(2)(b)) that is authenticated (countersigned)
    > timely, by authorized individuals, as required in this section. If
    > the practitioner responsible for authenticating (countersigning)
    > an initial order or verbal order does not agree that inpatient
    > admission was appropriate or valid (including an unauthorized
    > verbal order), he or she should not authenticate (countersign) the
    > order and the beneficiary is not considered to be an inpatient.
    > The hospital stay may be billed to Part B as a hospital outpatient
    > encounter.

3.  **Knowledge of the patient's hospital course:** CMS considers only
    > the following practitioners to have sufficient knowledge about the
    > beneficiary's hospital course, medical plan of care, and current
    > condition to serve as the ordering practitioner: the admitting
    > physician of record ("attending") or a physician on call for him
    > or her, primary or covering hospitalists caring for the patient in
    > the hospital, the beneficiary's primary care practitioner or a
    > physician on call for the primary care practitioner, a surgeon
    > responsible for a major surgical procedure on the beneficiary or a
    > surgeon on call for him or her, emergency or clinic practitioners
    > caring for the beneficiary at the point of inpatient admission,
    > and other practitioners qualified to admit inpatients and actively
    > treating the beneficiary at the point of the inpatient admission
    > decision. A utilization review committee physician functioning in
    > that role does not have direct responsibility for the care of the
    > patient and is therefore not considered to be sufficiently
    > knowledgeable to order the inpatient admission. The order must be
    > written by one of the above practitioners directly involved with
    > the care of the beneficiary, and a utilization committee physician
    > may only write the order to admit if he or she is not acting in a
    > utilization review capacity and fulfills one of the direct patient
    > care roles, such as the attending physician. Utilization review
    > may not be conducted by any individual who was professionally
    > involved in the care of the patient whose case is being reviewed
    > ([[42 CFR
    > 482.30(d)(3)]{.underline}](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=03bf4f31cab9d31b0efda70dad773d85&mc=true&node=se42.5.482_130&rgn=div8)).

4.  **Timing:** The order must be furnished at or before the time of the
    > inpatient admission. The order can be written in advance of the
    > formal admission (e.g., for a pre‐scheduled surgery), but the
    > inpatient admission does not occur until hospital care services
    > are provided to the beneficiary. Conversely, in the unusual case
    > in which a patient is admitted as an inpatient prior to an order
    > to admit and there is no documented verbal order, the inpatient
    > stay should not be considered to commence until the inpatient
    > admission order is documented. CMS does not permit retroactive
    > orders. Authentication by the ordering practitioner of the order
    > (either by signature or, in the case of an initial order

> under (B)(2)(a) or a verbal order under (B)(2)(b), countersignature)
> is required prior to discharge for all inpatient cases.

5.  **Specificity of the Order**: The regulations at [[42 CFR
    > 412.3]{.underline}](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=03bf4f31cab9d31b0efda70dad773d85&mc=true&node=se42.2.412_13&rgn=div8)

    > at 78 FR 50942 states, "the order must specify the admitting
    > practitioner's recommendation to admit 'to inpatient,' 'as an
    > inpatient,' 'for inpatient services,' or similar language
    > specifying his or her recommendation for inpatient care. While CMS
    > does not require specific language to be used on the inpatient
    > admission order, it is in the interest of the hospital that the
    > ordering practitioner use language that clearly expresses intent
    > to admit the patient as inpatient that will be commonly understood
    > by any individual who could potentially review documentation of
    > the inpatient stay. CMS does not recommend using language that may
    > have specific meaning only to individuals that work in a
    > particular hospital (e.g., "admit to 7W") that will not be
    > commonly understood by others outside of the hospital.

> If admission order language used to specify inpatient or outpatient
> status is ambiguous, the best course of action would be to obtain and
> document clarification from the ordering practitioner before initial
> Medicare billing (ideally before the beneficiary is discharged). Under
> this policy, CMS will continue to treat orders that specify a
> typically outpatient or other limited service (e.g., admit "to ER,"
> "to Observation," "to Recovery," "to Outpatient Surgery," "to Day
> Surgery," or "to Short Stay Surgery") as defining a non‐ inpatient
> service, and such orders will not be treated as meeting the inpatient
> admission requirements.
>
> The admission order is evidence of the decision by the ordering
> practitioner to admit the beneficiary to inpatient status. In
> extremely rare circumstances, the order to admit may be missing or
> defective (that is, illegible, or incomplete, for example "inpatient"
> is not specified), yet the intent, decision, and recommendation of the
> ordering practitioner to admit the beneficiary as an inpatient can
> clearly be derived from the medical record. In these extremely rare
> situations, contractors have been provided with discretion to
> determine that this information constructively satisfies the
> requirement that the hospital inpatient admission order be present in
> the medical record. However, in order for the documentation to provide
> acceptable evidence to support the hospital inpatient admission, thus
> satisfying the requirement for the order, there can be no uncertainty
> regarding the intent, decision, and recommendation by the ordering
> practitioner to admit the beneficiary as an inpatient, and no
> reasonable possibility that the care could have been adequately
> provided in an outpatient setting.
>
> This narrow and limited alternative method of satisfying the
> requirement for documentation of the inpatient admission order in the
> medical record should be extremely rare, and may only be applied at
> the discretion of the contractor.

# - Nursing and Other Services

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03) A3-3101.2, HO-210.2**
>
> Nursing and other related services, use of hospital facilities, and
> medical social services ordinarily furnished by the hospital for the
> care and treatment of inpatients are covered under hospital insurance
> and included in the Prospective Payment system payment.
>
> **NOTE:** The services of a private-duty nurse or other private-duty
> attendant are not covered. Private-duty nurses or private-duty
> attendants are registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, or any
> other trained attendant whose services ordinarily are rendered to, and
> restricted to, a particular patient by arrangement between the patient
> and the private- duty nurse or attendant. Such persons are engaged or
> paid by an individual patient or by someone acting on their behalf,
> including a hospital that initially incurs the costs and looks to the
> patient for reimbursement for such noncovered services.
>
> Where the hospital acts on behalf of a patient, the services of the
> private-duty nurse or other attendant under such an arrangement are
> not inpatient hospital services regardless of the control which the
> hospital may exercise with respect to the services rendered by such
> private-duty nurse or attendant.

# - Anesthetist Services

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.2.A, HO-210.2.A**
>
> If the hospital engages the services of a nurse anesthetist or other
> nonphysician anesthetist (either on a salary or fee-for-service basis)
> under arrangements which provide for billing to be made by the
> hospital, the cost of the service when provided to an inpatient could
> be covered under Part A. (See the Medicare Claims Processing Manual
> for more information.)

# - Medical Social Services to Meet the Patient\'s Medically Related Social Needs

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.2.B, HO-210.2.B**
>
> Medical social services are services which contribute meaningfully to
> the treatment of a patient\'s condition. Such services include, but
> are not limited to:

-   Assessment of the social and emotional factors related to the
    patient\'s illness, need for care, response to treatment, and
    adjustment to care in the facility;

-   Appropriate action to obtain case work services to assist in
    resolving problems in these areas; and

-   Assessment of the relationship of the patient\'s medical and nursing
    requirements to their home situation, financial resources, and the
    community resources available to them in making the decision
    regarding their discharge.

# - Drugs and Biologicals

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03) A3-3101.3, HO-210.3**
>
> Drugs and biologicals for use in the hospital, which are ordinarily
> furnished by the hospital for the care and treatment of inpatients,
> are covered.
>
> Three basic requirements must be met for a drug or biological
> furnished by a hospital to be a covered hospital service:

1.  The drug or biological must represent a cost to the institution in
    rendering services to the beneficiary;

2.  The drug or biological must meet the statutory definition. Under the
    statute, payment may be made for a drug or biological only where it
    is included, or approved for inclusion, in the latest official
    edition of the United States Pharmacopoeia-National Formulary
    (USP-NF), the United States Pharmacopoeia Drug Information (USP DI),
    or the American Dental Association (ADA) Guide to Dental
    Therapeutics, except for those drugs and biologicals unfavorably
    evaluated in the ADA Guide to Dental Therapeutics. Combination drugs
    are also included in the definition of drugs if the combination
    itself or all of the therapeutic ingredients of the combination are
    included, or approved for inclusion, in any of the above drug
    compendia. Drugs and biologicals are considered approved for
    inclusion in a compendium if approved under the established
    procedure by the professional organization responsible for revision
    of the compendium; or be approved by the pharmacy and drug
    therapeutics or equivalent committee of the medical staff of the
    hospital for use in the hospital; and

3.  Use of the drug or biological must be safe and effective and
    otherwise reasonable and necessary as specified in the Medicare
    Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, "Covered Medical and Other Health
    Services," §50.

> Drugs or biologicals approved for marketing by the Food and Drug
> Administration (FDA) are considered safe and effective for purposes of
> this last requirement when used for indications specified in the
> labeling. Therefore, use of an FDA-approved drug or biological is
> covered if:

-   It was administered on or after the date of the FDA\'s approval;

-   It is reasonable and necessary for the individual patient; and

-   All other applicable coverage requirements are met.

> Drugs and biologicals, which have not received final marketing
> approval by the FDA, are not covered unless CMS instructs the A/B MAC
> (A) to the contrary. However, FDA- approved drugs are used for
> indications other than those specified on the labeling. As long as the
> FDA has not specified such use as nonapproved, coverage is determined
> taking into consideration the generally accepted medical practice in
> the community. For example, the labeling of certain chemotherapeutic
> drugs indicates their use in the therapy of specified types of cancer.
> However, based on experience and empirical evidence, physicians may
> prescribe these drugs for a wider range of cancer treatments than what
> is indicated in the labeling. Local medical review policy may or may
> not grant coverage, depending on the circumstances.
>
> Determinations as to whether use of a drug or biological is reasonable
> and necessary for an individual patient are the responsibility of the
> Quality Improvement Organization (QIO), if this is part of the review
> for a PPS acute care admission. However, if this is an excluded
> service claim being reviewed by the A/B MAC (A), the A/B MAC (A)
> reviews and makes a determination, unless it cannot and needs to refer
> it to the QIO for an initial determination.
>
> A hospital stay solely for the purpose of use of a drug or biological
> that is determined not reasonable and necessary is not covered.

# - Drugs Included in the Drug Compendia

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.2.A, HO-210.3.A**
>
> Medicare covers only those drugs and biologicals included, or approved
> for inclusion, in the latest official edition or revision of the
> compendia as previously listed.
>
> Where a drug is excluded from coverage because it is unfavorably
> evaluated in either the AMA Drug Evaluations or Accepted Dental
> Therapeutics, the exclusion applies to all uses for which the drug or
> biological was so unfavorably evaluated.
>
> Drugs and biologicals are considered \"approved for inclusion\" in a
> compendium if approved under the procedure established by the
> professional organization responsible for revision of the compendium.

# - Approval by Pharmacy and Drug Therapeutics Committee

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.3.B, HO-210.3.B**
>
> A pharmacy and drug therapeutics or equivalent committee is a medical
> staff committee that confers with the hospital pharmacist in the
> formulation of policies pertaining to
>
> drugs. Drugs and biologicals approved for use in the hospital by such
> a committee are covered only if the committee develops and maintains a
> formulary or list of drugs accepted for use in the hospital. The
> committee need not function exclusively as a pharmacy and drug
> therapeutics committee but may also carry on other medical staff
> functions.
>
> Drugs and biologicals are considered approved for use in the hospital
> if selected for inclusion in the hospital drug list of formulary under
> the procedure of the committee established for that purpose. Express
> approval is required; the fact that a drug or biological has not been
> specifically determined to be unacceptable for use in the hospital
> does not constitute approval.
>
> Drugs and biologicals are covered if approved for general use in the
> hospital, or if approved for use by a particular patient or group of
> patients. Approval by a pharmacy and drug therapeutics committee is an
> alternative to approval for inclusion of the drug or biological in an
> approved drug compendium (see
> [[§30.1]{.underline}](#drugs-included-in-the-drug-compendia) above);
> such approval does not preclude the need for a determination of
> medical necessity. An investigational drug is not considered to meet
> the reasonable and necessary test since its efficacy has not yet been
> established.
>
> The decision of individual hospitals should not transcend the
> determinations of the Food and Drug Administration and Public Health
> Service in respect to the safety and effectiveness of drugs.
> Therefore, even if approved by an appropriate hospital committee, the
> reasonable cost of an investigational or other nonapproved drug or
> biological (e.g., Laetrile) cannot be reimbursed. This exclusion from
> payment applies whether or not the drug or biological is administered
> during the course of an otherwise covered hospital stay, since payment
> may not be made for items and services that are not reasonable and
> necessary. A hospital stay solely for the purpose of administering a
> drug or biological that is not reasonable and necessary, including an
> investigational drug or biological, is not covered and the drug or
> biological itself is not covered.

# - Combination Drugs

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.3.C, HO-210-3.C**
>
> Combination drugs are covered if the combination itself or all of the
> therapeutic ingredients of the combination are included, or approved
> for inclusion, in any of the designated drug compendia. **Any**
> combination drug approved for use in the hospital by the pharmacy and
> drug therapeutics or equivalent committee is covered.

# - Drugs Specially Ordered for Inpatients

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.3.D, HO-210.3.D**
>
> Coverage is not limited to drugs and biologicals routinely stocked by
> the hospital; a drug or biological not stocked by the hospital, which
> the hospital obtains for the patient from an outside source, such as a
> community pharmacy, can also be covered.
>
> Drugs and biologicals not included in the drug list or formulary
> maintained by the hospital\'s pharmacy and drug therapeutics committee
> may be covered if the hospital has a policy which permits such drugs
> to be furnished to a patient at the special request of a physician.
> However, in order to be covered, such drugs and biologicals must be
> included, or approved for inclusion, in one of the designated drug
> compendia. (In addition, a combination drug, or all of its therapeutic
> ingredients, would have to be included or approved for inclusion in
> one of the compendia.)

# - Drugs for Use Outside the Hospital

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.3.E, HO-210.3.E**
>
> Drugs and biologicals furnished by a hospital to an inpatient for use
> outside the hospital are, in general, not covered as inpatient
> hospital services. However, if the drug or biological is deemed
> medically necessary to permit or facilitate the patient\'s departure
> from the hospital, and a limited supply is required until the patient
> can obtain a continuing supply, the limited supply of the drug or
> biological is covered as an inpatient hospital service.

# 40 - Supplies, Appliances, and Equipment

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03) A3-3101.4, HO-210.4**
>
> Supplies, appliances, and equipment, which are ordinarily furnished by
> the hospital for the care and treatment of the beneficiary solely
> during the inpatient hospital stay, are covered inpatient hospital
> services.
>
> Under certain circumstances, supplies, appliances, and equipment used
> during the beneficiary\'s inpatient stay are covered under Part A even
> though the supplies, appliances and equipment leave the hospital with
> the patient upon discharge. These are circumstances in which it would
> be unreasonable or impossible from a medical standpoint to limit the
> patient\'s use of the item to the periods during which the individual
> is an inpatient. Examples of items covered under this rule are:

-   Items permanently installed in or attached to the patient\'s body
    while an inpatient, such as cardiac valves, cardiac pacemakers, and
    artificial limbs; and

-   Items which are temporarily installed in or attached to the
    patient\'s body while an inpatient, and which are also necessary to
    permit or facilitate the patient\'s release from the hospital, such
    as tracheotomy or drainage tubes.

> Hospital "admission packs" containing primarily toilet articles, such
> as soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and combs, are covered under Part A
> if routinely furnished by the hospital to all its inpatients. If not
> routinely furnished to all patients, the packs are not covered. In
> that situation, the hospital may charge beneficiaries for the pack,
> but only if they request it with knowledge of what they are requesting
> and what the charge to them will be.
>
> Supplies, appliances, and equipment furnished to an inpatient for use
> **only** outside the hospital are not, in general, covered as
> inpatient hospital services. However, a temporary or disposable item,
> which is medically necessary to permit or facilitate the patient\'s
> departure from the hospital and is required until the patient can
> obtain a continuing supply, is covered as an inpatient hospital
> service.
>
> Oxygen furnished to hospital inpatients is covered under Part A as an
> inpatient supply.

# - Other Diagnostic or Therapeutic Items or Services

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03) A3-3101.5, HO-210.5**
>
> Other diagnostic or therapeutic items or services ordinarily furnished
> inpatients by the hospital or by others under arrangements made by the
> hospital are covered. This category of covered services encompasses
> items and services not otherwise specifically listed as covered
> inpatient hospital services. (See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual,
> Chapter 15, "Covered Medical and Other Health Services.")
>
> Such services to hospital inpatients may be covered under Part A even
> when furnished off the hospital premises. For example, diagnostic or
> therapeutic services of an audiologist off the hospital premises are
> covered if billed for by the hospital under arrangements (see Pub
> 100-01, the Medicare General Information, Eligibility, and Entitlement
> Manual, Chapter 5, §10.3, for further information concerning "under
> arrangements"), if the services are furnished at a speech and hearing
> center, and if the audiologist meets the qualifications for an
> audiologist:

-   Is licensed if applicable by the State in which practicing; and

-   Is eligible for a certification of clinical competence in audiology
    granted by the American Speech and Hearing Association; or

-   Meets the education requirements for certification and is in the
    process of accumulating the supervised experience required for
    certification.

    1.  # - Therapeutic Items

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.5.A, HO-210.5**
>
> Therapeutic items, which are covered when ordinarily furnished by the
> hospital to its inpatients, or when ordinarily furnished to hospital
> inpatients by others under arrangements with them made by the
> hospital, include but are not limited to the following:

-   Surgical dressings, and splints, casts, and other devices used for
    the reduction of fractures and dislocations;

-   Prosthetic devices (other than dental) which replace all or part of
    an internal body organ (including contiguous tissue) or replace all
    or part of the function of a permanently inoperative or
    malfunctioning internal body organ; and

-   Leg, arm, back, and neck braces, trusses, and artificial legs, arms,
    and eyes.

> With respect to items that leave the hospital with the patient upon
> discharge, such as splints or casts, the rules for determining whether
> the item is covered are the same as the rules set forth above for
> supplies, appliances, and equipment.

# - Diagnostic Services of Psychologists and Physical Therapists

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.5.B, HO-210.5**
>
> When a psychologist or physical therapist is a salaried member of the
> staff of a hospital, their diagnostic or therapeutic services to
> inpatients of that hospital are covered. See the Medicare Claims
> Processing Manual for information on distinguishing between
> professional and technical services, and for information about billing
> and payment for nonphysician practitioners.

# - Diagnostic Services Furnished to an Inpatient by an Independent Clinical Laboratory Under Arrangements With the Hospital

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **A3-3101.5.C, HO-210.5**
>
> Diagnostic services furnished to an inpatient by an independent
> clinical laboratory under arrangements with the hospital are
> reimbursable under hospital insurance provided the lab is certified by
> CLIA to perform the services.
>
> An independent laboratory is one which is independent both of an
> **attending** or **consulting** physician\'s office and also
> independent of any hospital which meets at least the requirements to
> qualify as an emergency hospital (e.g., maintains clinical records,
> has a utilization review plan, meets the health and safety
> requirements found necessary by the Secretary of Health and Human
> Services).
>
> A consulting physician is one whose services include history taking,
> examination of the patient and, in each case, furnishing to the
> attending physician an opinion regarding
>
> diagnosis or treatment. A physician providing clinical laboratory
> services for patients of other physicians is not considered to be a
> consulting physician.
>
> A laboratory operated by or under the supervision of a hospital (or
> the organized medical staff of the hospital) that does not meet at
> least the definition of an emergency hospital is considered to be an
> independent laboratory. However, a laboratory serving hospital
> patients and operated on the premises of a hospital that meets the
> definition of an emergency hospital is presumed to be subject to the
> supervision of the hospital or its organized medical staff and is not
> an independent laboratory. A laboratory that a physician or group of
> physicians maintains for performing diagnostic tests in connection
> with their own or the group practice is also not considered to be an
> independent laboratory.
>
> An out-of-hospital laboratory is ordinarily presumed to be independent
> unless there is written evidence establishing that it is operated by
> or under the supervision of a hospital that meets at least the
> definition of an emergency hospital or of the organized medical staff

>
> Where a laboratory operated on hospital premises is claimed to be
> independent or where an out-of-hospital facility is designated as a
> hospital laboratory, the CMS regional office makes the determination

>
> A clinical laboratory is a laboratory where microbiological,

> immunohematological, or pathological examinations are performed on
> materials derived from the human body, to provide information for the
> diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a disease or assessment of a
> medical condition.
>
> The \"Conditions of Participation for Hospitals (HIRM-1)\" call for
> independent clinical laboratory services furnished under arrangements
> made by a hospital to be furnished only by a laboratory meeting the
> specified conditions for coverage under the program. These require
> that:

-   Where State or applicable local law provides for licensing of
    independent clinical laboratories, the laboratory is either licensed
    under law or is approved as meeting the requirements for licensing
    by the State or local agency responsible for licensing laboratories;
    and

-   Such laboratories also meet the health and safety requirements
    prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. (See "The
    Conditions of Participation for Hospitals" at [[42 CFR
    482]{.underline}](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title42-vol5/pdf/CFR-2014-title42-vol5-part482.pdf)).

> Where independent laboratory services are provided to patients of a
> participating hospital under arrangements with the hospital, the law
> does not require as a condition of payment
>
> in an individual case that the independent laboratory be approved
> under the program. In processing individual claims, the A/B MAC (A),
> therefore, need not verify that the services were obtained from an
> approved laboratory. The A/B MAC (A) should make payment for
> laboratory services although it may know that the laboratory from
> which the hospital has obtained the service is not approved under the
> program. However, it should promptly refer this information to the
> appropriate regional office for review of the determination of the
> hospital\'s compliance with the conditions of participation and for
> whatever action the regional office deems appropriate. The above

> documentation in the patient's IRF medical record (which must include
> the preadmission screening described in section 110.1.1, the overall
> plan of care described in section 110.1.3, and the admission orders
> described in section 110.1.4) must demonstrate a reasonable
> expectation that the following criteria were met at the [time of
> admission]{.underline} to the IRF*. Certain exceptions to these
> requirements may apply due to conditions arising during the Public
> Health Emergency defined in 42 CFR § 400.200. These exceptions are
> described further in Section 110.2.6 of this manual.*

1.  The patient must require the active and ongoing therapeutic
    intervention of multiple therapy disciplines (physical therapy,
    occupational therapy, speech- language pathology, or
    prosthetics/orthotics), one of which must be physical or
    occupational therapy.

2.  The patient must generally require an intensive rehabilitation
    therapy program, as defined in section 110.2.2. Under current
    industry standards, this intensive rehabilitation therapy program
    generally consists of at least 3 hours of therapy per day at least 5
    days per week. In certain well-documented cases, this intensive
    rehabilitation therapy program might instead consist of at least 15
    hours of intensive rehabilitation therapy within a 7 consecutive
    *calendar* day period, beginning with the date of admission to the
    IRF.

3.  The patient must reasonably be expected to actively participate in,
    and benefit significantly from, the intensive rehabilitation therapy
    program that is defined in section 110.2.2 at the time of admission
    to the IRF. The patient can only be expected to benefit
    significantly from the intensive rehabilitation therapy program if
    the patient's condition and functional status are such that the
    patient can reasonably be expected to make measurable improvement
    (that will be of practical value to improve the patient's functional
    capacity or adaptation to

> impairments) as a result of the rehabilitation treatment, as defined
> in section 110.3, and if such improvement can be expected to be made
> within a prescribed period of time. The patient need not be expected
> to achieve complete independence in the domain of self-care nor be
> expected to return to his or her prior level of functioning in order
> to meet this standard.

4.  The patient must require physician supervision by a rehabilitation
    physician, defined as a licensed physician *who is determined by the
    IRF to have* specialized training and experience in *inpatient*
    rehabilitation*.* The requirement for medical supervision means that
    the rehabilitation physician must conduct face-to-face visits with
    the patient at least 3 days per week throughout the patient's stay
    in the IRF to assess the patient both medically and functionally, as
    well as to modify the course of treatment as needed to maximize the
    patient's capacity to benefit from the rehabilitation process.
    *Beginning with the second week of admission to the IRF, a
    non-physician practitioner who is determined by the IRF to have
    specialized training and experience in inpatient rehabilitation may
    conduct 1of the 3 required face-to-face visits with the patient per
    week, provided that such duties are within the non-physician
    practitioner's scope of practice under applicable state law. In the
    first week of the patient's IRF stay, the rehabilitation physician
    is required to visit the patients a minimum of three times to ensure
    that the patient's plan of care is fully established and optimized
    to the patient's care needs in the IRF. For the second, third,
    fourth weeks of the stay, and beyond, CMS will continue to require
    Medicare fee-for-services beneficiaries in the IRFs to receive a
    minimum of three rehabilitation physician visits per week, but will
    allow non-physician practitioners to independently conduct one of
    these three minimum require visits per week.*

5.  The patient must require an intensive and coordinated
    interdisciplinary approach to providing rehabilitation, as defined
    in section 110.2.5.

    1.  # - Multiple Therapy Disciplines

> **(Rev. 112, Issued: 10-23-09, Effective: 01-01-10, Implementation:
> 01-04-10)**
>
> A primary distinction between the IRF environment and other
> rehabilitation settings is the interdisciplinary approach to providing
> rehabilitation therapy services in an IRF. Patients requiring only one
> discipline of therapy would not need this interdisciplinary approach
> to care. For this reason, the information in the patient's IRF medical
> record (especially the required documentation described in section
> 110.1) must document a reasonable expectation that, at the time of
> admission to the IRF, the patient required the active and ongoing
> therapeutic intervention of multiple therapy disciplines (physical
> therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, or
> prosthetics/orthotics), one of which must be physical or occupational
> therapy.

# - Intensive Level of Rehabilitation Services

## *(Rev. 10892; Issued: 08-06-21; Effective: 11-08-21; Implementation: 11-08-21)*

> A primary distinction between the IRF environment and other
> rehabilitation settings is the intensity of rehabilitation therapy

> least 3 hours per day at least 5 days per week. However, this is not
> the only way that such intensity of services can be demonstrated (that
> is, CMS does not intend for this measure to be used as a "rule of
> thumb" for determining whether a particular IRF claim is reasonable
> and necessary).
>
> The intensity of therapy services provided in IRFs could also be
> demonstrated by the provision of 15 hours of therapy per week (that
> is, in a 7-consecutive *calendar* day period starting from the date of
> admission). For example, if a hypothetical IRF patient was admitted to
> an IRF for a hip fracture, but was also undergoing chemotherapy for an

> of therapy 3 days per week and 1 ½ hours of therapy on 2 (or more)
> other days per week in order to accommodate his or her chemotherapy
> schedule.
>
> Thus, IRFs may also demonstrate a patient's need for intensive
> rehabilitation therapy services by showing that the patient required
> and could reasonably be expected to benefit from at least 15 hours of

> starting from the date of admission), as long as the reasons for the
> patient's need for this program of intensive rehabilitation are
> well-documented in the patient's IRF medical record and the overall
> amount of therapy can reasonably be expected to benefit the patient.
> Many IRF patients will medically benefit from more than 3 hours of
> therapy per day or more than 15 hours of therapy per week, when all
> types of therapy are considered. However, the intensity of therapy
> provided must be reasonable and necessary under section 1862(a)(1)(A)
> of the Act and must never exceed the patient's level of need or
> tolerance, or compromise the patient's safety. See below for a brief
> exceptions policy for temporary and unexpected events.
>
> *In accordance with 42 CFR § 412.622(a)(3)(ii), t*he required therapy
> treatments must begin within 36 hours from midnight of the day of

> such, they *should generally be* included in the total daily/weekly
> provision of therapies used to demonstrate the intensity of therapy
> services provided in an IRF.
>
> The standard of care for IRF patients is individualized (i.e.,
> one-on-one) therapy. Group therapies serve as an adjunct to individual
> therapies. In those instances in which group therapy better meets the
> patient's needs on a limited basis, the situation/rationale that

> [Brief Exceptions Policy]{.underline} - While patients requiring an
> IRF stay are expected to need and receive an intensive rehabilitation
> therapy program, as described above, this may not be
>
> true for a limited number of days during a patient's IRF stay because
> patients' needs vary over time. For example, if an unexpected clinical
> event occurs during the course of a patient's IRF stay that limits the
> patient's ability to participate in the intensive therapy program for
> a brief period not to exceed 3 consecutive days (e.g., extensive
> diagnostic tests off premises, prolonged intravenous infusion of
> chemotherapy or blood products, bed rest due to signs of deep vein
> thrombosis, exhaustion due to recent ambulance transportation,
> surgical procedure, etc.), the specific reasons for the break in the
> provision of therapy services *should generally* be documented in the
> patient's IRF medical record. If these reasons are appropriately
> documented in the patient's IRF medical record, such a break in
> service (of limited duration) *should generally* not affect the
> determination of the medical necessity of the IRF admission. Thus, A/B

# - Physician Supervision

## *(Rev. 10892; Issued: 08-06-21; Effective: 11-08-21; Implementation: 11-08-21)*

> A primary distinction between the IRF environment and other
> rehabilitation settings is the high level of physician supervision
> that accompanies the provision of intensive rehabilitation therapy
> services. For this reason, the information in the patient's IRF
> medical record (especially the required documentation described in
> section 110.1) must document a reasonable expectation that at the time
> of admission to the IRF the patient's medical management and
> rehabilitation needs require an inpatient stay and close physician
> involvement. Close physician involvement in the patient's care is
> demonstrated by documented face-to-face visits from a rehabilitation
> physician at least 3 days per week throughout the patient's IRF stay.
> *Beginning with the second week of admission to the IRF, a
> non-physician practitioner who is determined by the IRF to have
> specialized training and experience in inpatient rehabilitation may
> conduct 1 of the 3 required face-to-face visits with the patient per
> week, provided that such duties are within the non-physician
> practitioner's scope of practice under applicable state law. In the
> first week of the patient's IRF stay, the rehabilitation physician is
> required to visit patients a minimum of three times to ensure that the
> patient's plan of care is fully established and optimized to the
> patient's care needs in the IRF. In the second, third, fourth weeks of
> the*
>
> *stay, and beyond, CMS will continue to require Medicare
> fee-for-service beneficiaries in IRFs to receive a minimum of three
> rehabilitation physician visits per week, but will allow non-physician
> practitioners to independently conduct one of these three minimum
> required visits per week.*
>
> The purpose of the face-to-face visits is to assess the patient both
> medically and functionally (with an emphasis on the important
> interactions between the patient's medical and functional goals and
> progress), as well as to modify the course of treatment as needed to
> maximize the patient's capacity to benefit from the rehabilitation
> process. Other physician specialties may treat and visit the patient,
> as needed, more often than 3 days per week. However, the requirement
> for IRF physician supervision is intended to ensure that IRF patients
> receive more comprehensive assessments of their functional goals and
> progress, in light of their medical conditions, by a rehabilitation
> physician *who is determined by the IRF to have specialized* training
> and experience *in inpatient rehabilitation* at least 3 times per
> week. The required rehabilitation physician *and non- physician
> practitioner* visits *should generally* be documented in the patient's
> medical record at the IRF *per the requirements at 42 CFR §
> 482.24(4)(c)(vi).*

# - Interdisciplinary Team Approach to the Delivery of Care

## *(Rev. 10892; Issued: 08-06-21; Effective: 11-08-21; Implementation: 11-08-21)*

> An IRF stay will only be considered reasonable and necessary if at the
> time of admission to the IRF the documentation in the patient's IRF
> medical record indicates a reasonable expectation that the complexity
> of the patient's nursing, medical management, and rehabilitation needs
> requires an inpatient stay and an interdisciplinary team approach to
> the delivery of rehabilitation care. That is, the complexity of the
> patient's condition must be such that the rehabilitation goals
> indicated in the preadmission screening, and the overall plan of care
> can only be achieved through periodic team conferences---at least once
> a week---of an interdisciplinary team of medical professionals (as
> defined below).
>
> Interdisciplinary services are those provided by a treatment team in
> which all of its members participate in a coordinated effort to
> benefit the patient and the patient's significant others and
> caregivers. Interdisciplinary services, by definition, cannot be
> provided by only one discipline. Though individual members of the
> interdisciplinary team work within their own scopes of practice, each
> professional is also expected to coordinate his or her efforts with
> team members of other specialties, as well as with the patient and the
> patient's significant others and caregivers. The purpose of the
> interdisciplinary team is to foster frequent, structured, and
> documented communication among disciplines to establish, prioritize,
> and achieve treatment goals.
>
> *In accordance with the requirements at 42 CFR 412.622(a)(5), a*t a
> minimum, the interdisciplinary team must document participation by
> professionals from each of the following disciplines (each of whom
> must have current knowledge of the patient as documented in the
> medical record at the IRF):

-   A rehabilitation physician *who is determined by the IRF to have*
    > specialized training and experience in *inpatient* rehabilitation;

-   A registered nurse with specialized training or experience in
    > rehabilitation;

-   A social worker or a case manager (or both); and

-   A licensed or certified therapist from each therapy discipline
    > involved in treating the patient.

> The interdisciplinary team must be led by a rehabilitation physician
> *either in person or remotely via a mode of communication such as
> video or telephone conferencing,* who is responsible for making the
> final decisions regarding the patient's treatment in the IRF. This
> physician must document concurrence with all decisions made by the
> interdisciplinary team at each meeting.
>
> The periodic team conferences---held a minimum of once per week---must
> focus on: Assessing the individual\'s progress towards the
> rehabilitation goals;

-   Considering possible resolutions to any problems that could impede
    progress towards the goals;

-   Reassessing the validity of the rehabilitation goals previously
    established; and

-   Monitoring and revising the treatment plan, as needed.

> A team conference may be formal or informal; however, a review by the
> various team members of each other\'s notes does not constitute a team
> conference. It is expected that all treating professionals from the
> required disciplines will be at every meeting or, in the infrequent

> each team conference *should generally* include the names and
> professional designations of the participants in the team conference.
> *Signatures from participants of the interdisciplinary team meeting
> are not required other than the rehabilitation physician's concurrence
> as noted above.* The occurrence of the team conferences and the
> decisions made during such conferences, such as those concerning
> discharge planning and the need for any adjustment in goals or in the
> prescribed treatment program, must be recorded in the patient's
> medical record in the IRF. The focus of the review of this requirement

## *(Rev. 10892; Issued: 08-06-21; Effective: 11-08-21; Implementation: 11-08-21)* Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) Flexibilities Issued on March 30, 2020

> *On March 30, 2020, CMS issued the interim final rule "Medicare and
> Medicaid*
>
> *Programs; Policy and Regulatory Revisions in Response to the COVID-19
> Public Health Emergency" (CMS-1744-IFC). This interim final rule

> CFR § 412.622(a)(4)(ii) for all Medicare Part A fee-for-service
> beneficiaries during the public health emergency (PHE) specified in 42
> CFR 400.200. Thus, contractors shall not require documentation of
> post-admission physician evaluations in the IRF medical records for
> Medicare Part A fee-for-service beneficiaries during the PHE. As
> discussed in Section 110.1.2, CMS subsequently removed the
> post-admission physician evaluation documentation requirement entirely
> beginning with FY 2021 (e.g., for all IRF discharges beginning on or
> after October 1, 2020).*
>
> *This interim final rule also revises the physician supervision
> requirement in 42 CFR § 412.622(a)(3)(iv) and § 412.29(e) to permit
> physician visits in the IRF required under these provisions to be
> conducted via telehealth to safeguard the health and safety of
> Medicare beneficiaries and the rehabilitation physicians treating them
> during the PHE. Contractors shall allow rehabilitation physicians to
> use telehealth services as defined in section 1834(m)(4)(F) of the Act
> to conduct the required 3 physician visits per week during the PHE for
> the COVID-19 pandemic.*

## *IRF Flexibilities Issued on April 30, 2020*

> *On April 30, 2020, CMS issued the interim final rule "Medicare and
> Medicaid Programs, Basic Health Program, and Exchanges; Additional
> Policy and Regulatory Revisions in Response to the COVID-19 Public
> Health Emergency and Delay of Certain Reporting Requirements for the
> Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting Program" (CMS-5531- IFC).
> This interim final rule, codified at 42 CFR § 412.622(a)(3)(ii),
> waives the IRF "3- hour rule" in accordance with section 3711(a) of
> the CARES Act.*
>
> *As a result of the "3-hour rule" waiver, contractors shall not review
> Medicare Part A fee-for-service beneficiaries admitted to IRFs during

> for compliance with 42 CFR § 412.622(a)(3)(ii).*
>
> *That is, Medicare Part A fee-for-service beneficiaries admitted to
> IRFs during the PHE do not need to receive at least 15 hours of
> intensive rehabilitation therapy per week. This waiver applies to all
> patients admitted to IRFs during the PHE.*
>
> *This interim final rule also modifies the IRF coverage and
> classification requirements in 42 CFR § 412.29(d), (e), (h), and (i)
> and § 412.622(a)(3)(i), (iii) -- (iv), (4), and (5) for the public

> following criteria are satisfied at the time of admission to the IRF:*

-   *Patient is admitted to a freestanding IRF solely to alleviate acute
    care hospital bed capacity issues, and*

-   *IRF is located in a state (or region, as applicable) that is
    experiencing a surge during the Public Health Emergency, as defined
    in 42 CFR § 400.200.*

> *The regulation at 42 CFR § 412.622(c), as amended by the April 30,
> 2020 interim final rule, specifies that a "state (or region, as
> applicable) that is experiencing a surge" refers to a state region
> that is in Phase 1 of the presidential "Guidelines for Opening Up
> America Again"
> (([[https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/]{.underline}](https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/)),
> specifically, a state (or region, as applicable) that satisfies all of
> the following, as determined by applicable state and local officials:*

1.  *All vulnerable individuals continue to shelter in place.*

2.  *Individuals continue social distancing.*

3.  *Individuals avoid socializing in groups of more than 10.*

4.  *Non-essential travel is minimized.*

5.  *Visits to senior living facilities and hospitals are prohibited.*

6.  *Schools and organized youth activities remain closed.*

> *The evolution of the Phase 1 criteria listed above are most likely to
> be clearly articulated by a state's governor. Further, contractors
> will need to be aware that there may not be a clearly posted phase for
> a state or community that aligns with the presidential "Guidelines for
> Opening Up America Again" cited at 42 CFR § 412.622(c).*
>
> *Some of the criteria are likely to be in place across a number of
> phases, particularly the criteria in (i), (ii), and (iii). An example
> of a more complicated criteria to apply is (iv). Non-essential travel
> can still be minimized, even after stay at home orders are lifted in
> an area to allow for additional access to health care services or to
> allow for additional commerce (such as manufacturing) to improve the
> overall economic circumstances of a region or state. There may also be
> circumstances where beach regions, which can provide more ability for
> social distancing, of a state are reopening whereas more concentrated
> population centers remain with higher restrictions. Thus, contractors
> should apply the standard regionally, as applicable. Furthermore,
> schools and organized youth activities may be closed simply because of
> the time of year (for instance, during the summer months).*
>
> *Additionally, contractors should recognize that, in some cases,
> states or regions can move to Phase 2 or Phase 3 of the plan and then
> return to Phase 1 if they experience another surge in cases.*
>
> *In the April 30, 2020 interim final rule, CMS instructed freestanding
> IRFs to add the letters "DS" to the end of their unique hospital
> patient identification numbers (the numbers that identify the
> patients' medical records in the IRF) to identify patients who are
> being treated in a freestanding IRF hospital solely to alleviate

> numbers for meeting any of the following requirements:*

-   *Needing at least 2 forms of therapy (one of which must be physical
    or occupational therapy,*

-   *Being sufficiently stable to tolerate the IRF intensive
    rehabilitation therapy program,*

-   *Requiring close medical supervision by a rehabilitation physician,
    as demonstrated by at least 3 rehabilitation physician visits per
    week,*

-   *Having a preadmission screening,*

-   *Having an individualized overall plan of care, or*

-   *Having an interdisciplinary approach to care, including weekly
    interdisciplinary team meetings.*

> *In addition, as noted at 85 FR 27573 contractors shall not include
> freestanding IRF patient medical records that have "DS" at the end of
> their unique hospital patient identifier numbers when reviewing
> whether the IRF meets the following coverage requirements:*

-   *Has in effect a preadmission screening procedure,*

-   *Has in effect a procedure for ensuring that patients receive close
    medical supervision by a physician,*

-   *Has a plan of treatment for each patient, or*

-   *Uses an interdisciplinary approach to care.*

# - Definition of Measurable Improvement

> **(Rev. 179, Issued: 01-14-14, Effective: 01-07-14, Implementation:
> 01-07-14)**
>
> A patient can only be expected to benefit significantly from an
> intensive rehabilitation therapy program provided in an IRF, as
> required in section 110.2.3, if the patient's IRF medical record
> indicates a reasonable expectation that a measurable, practical
> improvement in the patient's functional condition can be accomplished
> within a predetermined and reasonable period of time. In general, the
> goal of IRF treatment is to enable the patient's safe return to the
> home or community-based environment upon discharge from the IRF. The
> patient's IRF medical record is expected to indicate both the nature
> and degree of expected improvement and the expected length of time to
> achieve the improvement.
>
> Since discharge planning is an integral part of any rehabilitation
> program and must begin upon the patient's admission to the IRF, an
> extended period of time for discharge from the IRF would not be
> reasonable and necessary after established goals have been reached or
> the determination has been made that further progress is unlikely.
>
> For an IRF stay to be considered reasonable and necessary, the patient
> does not have to be expected to achieve complete independence in the
> domain of self-care or return to his or her prior level of
> functioning. However, to justify the need for a continued IRF stay,
> the documentation in the IRF medical record must demonstrate the
> patient's ongoing requirement for an intensive level of rehabilitation
> services (as defined in section 110.2.1) and an inter-disciplinary
> team approach to care (as defined in section 110.2.2). Further, the
> IRF medical record must also demonstrate that the patient is making
> functional improvements that are ongoing and sustainable, as well as
> of practical value, measured against his/her condition at the start of
> treatment. Since in most instances the goal of an IRF stay is to
> enable a patient's safe return to the home or community-based
> environment upon discharge, the patient's treatment goals and
> achievements during an IRF admission are expected to reflect
> significant and timely progress toward this end result. During most
> IRF stays, therefore, the emphasis of therapies would generally shift
> from traditional, patient-centered therapeutic services to
> patient/caregiver education, durable medical equipment training, and
> other similar therapies that prepare the patient for a safe discharge
> to the home or community-based environment.
>
> CMS notes that as evidenced by the criteria established above, an IRF
> claim could never be denied for the following reasons: (1) because a
> patient could not be expected to achieve complete independence in the
> domain of self-care or (2) because a patient could not be expected to
> return to his or her prior level of functioning.

# 120 - Services Related to and Required as a Result of Services Which Are Not Covered Under Medicare

> **(Rev. 189, Issued: 06-27-14, Effective: 05-30-14, Implementation:
> 06-29-14)**
>
> Medical and hospital services are sometimes required to treat a
> condition that arises as a result of services that are not covered
> because they are determined to be not reasonable and necessary or
> because they are excluded from coverage for other reasons. Services
> \"related to\" non-covered services (e.g., cosmetic surgery,
> non-covered organ transplants, non-covered artificial organ implants,
> etc.), including services related to follow-up care and complications
> of non-covered services which require treatment during a hospital stay
> in which the non-covered service was performed, are not covered
> services under Medicare. Services \"not related to\" non-covered
> services are covered under Medicare.
>
> Following are examples of services \"related to\" and \"not related
> to\" non-covered services while the beneficiary is an inpatient:

-   A beneficiary was hospitalized for a non-covered service and broke a
    > leg while in the hospital. Services related to care of the broken
    > leg during this stay is a clear example of \"not related to\"
    > services and are covered under Medicare.

-   A beneficiary was admitted to the hospital for covered services, but
    > during the course of hospitalization became a candidate for a
    > non-covered transplant or

> implant and actually received the transplant or implant during that
> hospital stay. When the original admission was entirely unrelated to
> the diagnosis that led to a recommendation for a non-covered
> transplant or implant, the services related to the admitting condition
> would be covered.

-   A beneficiary was admitted to the hospital for covered services
    > related to a condition which ultimately led to identification of a
    > need for transplant and receipt of a transplant during the same
    > hospital stay. If, on the basis of the nature of the services and
    > a comparison of the date they are received with the date on which
    > the beneficiary is identified as a transplant candidate, the
    > services could reasonably be attributed to preparation for the
    > non-covered transplant, the services would be \"related to\"
    > non-covered services and would also be non-covered.

> Following is an example of services received subsequent to a
> non-covered inpatient stay:
>
> After a beneficiary has been discharged from the hospital stay in
> which the beneficiary received non-covered services, medical and
> hospital services required to treat a condition or complication that
> arises as a result of the prior non-covered services may be covered
> when they are reasonable and necessary in all other respects. Thus,
> coverage could be provided for subsequent inpatient stays or
> outpatient treatment ordinarily covered by Medicare, even if the need
> for treatment arose because of a previous non-covered procedure. Some
> examples of services that may be found to be covered under this policy
> are the reversal of intestinal bypass surgery for obesity,
> complications from cosmetic surgery, removal of a non-covered bladder
> stimulator, or treatment of any infection at the surgical site of a
> non-covered transplant that occurred following discharge from the
> hospital.
>
> However, any subsequent services that could be expected to have been
> incorporated into a global fee are not covered. Thus, where a patient
> undergoes cosmetic surgery and the treatment regimen calls for a
> series of postoperative visits to the surgeon for evaluating the
> patient\'s progress, these visits are not covered.

# -- Religious Nonmedical Health Care Institution (RNHCI) Services

> **(Rev. 45, Issued: 02-10-06; Effective: 05-11-06;Implementation:
> 05-11-06)**
>
> Section 1821 of the Social Security Act provides for coverage of
> services furnished in a Medicare qualified religious nonmedical health
> care institution (RNHCI), when the beneficiary meets specific coverage
> conditions. The beneficiary must have a valid election for RNHCI
> services and would otherwise qualify for care in a conventional
> hospital or post hospital extended care facility that was not a
> religious nonmedical health care institution.
>
> The RNHCI benefit provides only for Part A inpatient services. The
> Medicare program will only pay for nonmedical health care services
> furnished in RNHCIs, as defined in Section 1861(ss)(1) of the Act and
> 42 CFR 403 Subpart G. The program does not pay for
>
> supporting religious services or payment for the religious
> practitioner. The cost of religious items/services and the cost of
> using a religious practitioner is a personal financial responsibility
> and not covered by Medicare.

# -- Beneficiary Eligibility for RNHCI Services

> **(Rev. 45, Issued: 02-10-06; Effective: 05-11-06;Implementation:
> 05-11-06)**
>
> A beneficiary may elect to receive care in an RNHCI based on his or
> her own religious convictions or to revoke that election at any time
> if for any reason he or she decides to pursue medical care. Section
> 1821(a) of the Act requires that as a condition for Part A Medicare
> coverage, the beneficiary must have a condition that would qualify
> under Medicare Part A for inpatient hospital services or extended care
> services furnished in a hospital or skilled nursing facility that is
> not an RNHCI if it were not for their religious convictions.
>
> When a beneficiary has an effective election on file with CMS but does
> not have a condition that would qualify for Medicare Part A inpatient
> hospital or posthospital extended care services if the beneficiary
> were an inpatient of a hospital or a resident of a SNF that is not an
> RNHCI, then services furnished in an RNHCI are not covered by
> Medicare. A Medicare claim for services that were furnished to that
> beneficiary would be treated as a claim for noncovered services. If
> the beneficiary only needs assistance with activities of daily living,
> then the beneficiary\'s condition could not be considered as meeting
> the Medicare Part A requirements. Prior to submitting a claim to
> Medicare it is the responsibility of the RNHCI's utilization review
> committee to determine that the beneficiary meets the Medicare Part A
> requirements.
>
> If no valid election is filed or the election has been revoked and no
> new election is in effect, the beneficiary does not have Medicare
> coverage for services furnished in an RNHCI. Consequently, a Medicare
> claim for services furnished to such a beneficiary would also be
> treated as a claim for noncovered services.
>
> In those cases where a beneficiary is admitted to an RNHCI with a
> valid election, the submission of prior claim for medical services to
> the Common Working File will revoke the election during the course of
> the RNHCI stay. If this is the first revocation, the beneficiary may
> make a new election without any disruption to the benefit. If this,
> however, is the second or subsequent revocation, the applicable
> waiting period applies and the remainder of the stay is not covered by
> Medicare (see 130.2.2).

# -- Election of RNHCI Benefits

> **(Rev. 45, Issued: 02-10-06; Effective: 05-11-06;Implementation:
> 05-11-06)**
>
> For an RNHCI to receive payment under the Medicare program, the
> beneficiary must make a written election to receive benefits under
> [[§1821]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of the Act.
> To elect religious nonmedical health care services, the beneficiary or
> the beneficiary's legal representative must attest that the individual
> is conscientiously opposed to acceptance of nonexcepted
>
> medical treatment, and the individual's acceptance of such treatment
> would be inconsistent with the individual's sincere religious beliefs.
>
> Religious non-medical care or religious method of healing means health
> care furnished under established religious tenets that prohibit
> conventional or unconventional medical care for the treatment of a
> beneficiary, and the sole reliance on these religious tenets to
> fulfill a beneficiary\'s total health care needs.
>
> Medical care or treatment means health care furnished by or under the
> direction of a licensed physician that can involve diagnosing,
> treating, or preventing disease and other damage to the mind and body.
> It may involve the use of pharmaceuticals, diet, exercise, surgical
> intervention, and technical procedures.
>
> The signed and notarized election must include a statement that the
> receipt of nonexcepted medical services would constitute a revocation
> of the election and may limit further receipt of payment of religious
> nonmedical health care services. The election is effective on the date
> it is signed, and it remains in effect until revoked in writing or by
> the receipt and filing of a claim for nonexcepted medical treatment.
>
> The completed election form must be filed with the specialty
> contractor, a copy retained by the RNHCI provider and a copy provided
> to the beneficiary. See Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing
> Manual, Chapter 3, Section 170 for instructions on submission of
> elections to the specialty contractor.
>
> Section 1821 defines "excepted" medical treatment as medical care or
> treatment that is received involuntarily or is required under Federal,
> State or local law. The term is intended to identify the kinds of
> medical services that can be provided to a beneficiary with an
> election for RNHCI services without revoking the election.
>
> Examples of excepted medical care include, but are not limited to the
> following:

-   A beneficiary that receives vaccinations required by a State or
    > local jurisdiction. This is compliant behavior to meet government
    > requirements and not considered as voluntarily seeking medical
    > care or services; or

-   A beneficiary who is involved in an accident and receives medical
    > attention at the accident scene, or in transport to the hospital,
    > or at the hospital before being able to make their beliefs and
    > wishes known; or

-   A beneficiary who is unconscious and receives emergency care and is
    > hospitalized before regaining consciousness or being able to
    > locate his or her legal representative.

> "Nonexcepted" medical treatment is defined as medical care or
> treatment other than excepted medical treatment. The term is intended
> to define the kinds of medical services
>
> that, if received by a beneficiary who has previously elected RNHCI
> services, would revoke the individual\'s election of services.
>
> Examples of nonexcepted medical care could include but are not limited
> to the following:

-   A beneficiary receiving medical diagnosis and/or treatment for
    persistent headaches and/or chest pains.

-   A beneficiary in an RNHCI who is transferring to a community
    hospital to have radiological studies and the reduction of a
    fracture.

-   A beneficiary with intractable back pain receiving medical,
    surgical, or chiropractic services.

-   A beneficiary who has requested a physician to prescribe a
    wheelchair or other durable medical equipment item.

> Note that the terms 'excepted' and 'nonexcepted' care represent
> mutually exclusive conditions under §1821 of the Social Security Act.
> Medicare contractors may use the examples above in making
> determinations of excepted and nonexcepted care.

# - Revocation of RNHCI Election

> **(Rev. 45, Issued: 02-10-06; Effective: 05-11-06;Implementation:
> 05-11-06)**
>
> Revocation is the cancellation of the RNHCI election and can be
> achieved in two ways: either by submitting a written statement to the
> intermediary indicating the desire to cancel the election or by
> seeking nonexcepted medical care for which Medicare payment is sought.
>
> See Pub. 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 3, Section
> 170 for instructions on submission of revocations to the specialty
> contractor. See section 180 of that manual for a description of how
> Medicare non-specialty contractors revoke elections upon billing for
> nonexcepted services.

# - RNHCI Election After Prior Revocation

> **(Rev. 45, Issued: 02-10-06; Effective: 05-11-06;Implementation:
> 05-11-06)**
>
> After an initial revocation, the individual may again file a written
> election to receive the religious nonmedical health care benefit. This
> second election takes effect immediately upon its execution. If an
> individual revokes a second election, the next (third) election cannot
> become effective until 1 year after the date of the most recent
> revocation.
>
> Subsequent elections are not effective until 5 years after the most
> recent revocation. Once an election is revoked, Medicare payment
> cannot be made to an RNHCI unless a valid election is filed. The RNHCI

# - Medicare Payment for RNHCI Services and Beneficiary Liability

> **(Rev. 45, Issued: 02-10-06; Effective: 05-11-06;Implementation:
> 05-11-06)**
>
> Medicare pays for RNHCI services under TEFRA payment rules (see Pub.
> 15-2, Provider Reimbursement Manual, chapter 30). RNHCI services are
> subject to the inpatient hospital cash deductible, when applicable. If
> services are for the 61^st^ through 90^th^ day of a benefit period or
> are for lifetime reserve days, RNHCI services are subject to
> coinsurance (see Pub. 100-01, Medicare General Information,
> Eligibility and Entitlement Manual, Chapter 3, Sections 10.1 and
> 10.2).
>
> Under normal Medicare rules, a provider of services may only bill a
> beneficiary deductible and coinsurance amounts. However, total
> Medicare payments to RNHCIs are subject to limits established in
> sections 1821(c)(2) (A) or (B) of the Act. In the event that the
> Medicare program reduces payments to RNHCIs based on these limits,
> RNHCIs may also bill beneficiaries an amount equal to any such
> reduction.

# - Coverage of RNHCI Items Furnished in the Home

> **(Rev. 45, Issued: 02-10-06; Effective: 05-11-06;Implementation:
> 05-11-06)**
>
> Prior to the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
> and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, the Medicare program's RNHCI
> benefit was limited to inpatient services provided in an RNHCI
> facility. The MMA revised sections 1821(a) and 1861 of the Social
> Security Act to extend coverage to RNHCI items and services that are
> provided in a beneficiary's home and that are comparable to items and
> services provided by a home health agency that is not an RNHCI.
>
> Beneficiaries elect the RNHCI benefit if they are conscientiously
> opposed to accepting most medical treatment, since accepting such
> services would be inconsistent with their sincere religious beliefs.
> The Medicare home health benefit provides skilled nursing, physical
> therapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathology and home
> health aide services to eligible beneficiaries under a physician's
> plan of care. The home health benefit also provides medical supplies,
> a covered osteoporosis drug and durable medical equipment (DME) while
> under a plan of care (see chapter 7).
>
> Medicare covers specified durable medical equipment and intermittent
> RNHCI nursing visits provided in the home to RNHCI beneficiaries.
> These services comprise the RNHCI home benefit. The remainder of the
> services covered under the Medicare home health benefit are medical in
> nature and must be provided under the order of a physician. As such,
> these services conflict with RNHCI beneficiaries' conscientious
> opposition to medical care.
>
> The RNHCI home benefit must exclude the same services that are
> excluded from the home health benefit, which include: drugs and
> biologicals; transportation; services that would not be covered as
> inpatient services; housekeeping services; services covered under the
> End Stage Renal Disease program; prosthetic devices; and medical
> social
>
> services provided to family members. These exclusions are defined at
> 42 CFR 409.49. Additionally, the RNHCI home benefit excludes the items
> or services provided by any HHA that is not an RNHCI; or any supplier,
> independent RNHCI nurse or aide that is working directly for a
> beneficiary rather than under arrangements with the RNHCI.
>
> Medicare requires a brief letter of intent from the provider in order
> to determine the number of RNHCIs that will be implementing the home
> service benefit.
>
> In the case where an RNHCI chooses to provide home services then only
> care on an intermittent basis, which is provided to an eligible
> beneficiary who is confined to their home for health reasons, will be
> covered under the home benefit. The home benefit is not to be confused
> with hospice care, which may involve more frequent visits and can
> involve institutional services. If for some reason the home serviced
> patient requires more than intermittent service, then institutional
> services may be required. However, the patient would need to meet the
> criteria for admission to a RNHCI, or the patient would require
> another institutional setting not necessarily covered by Medicare.
>
> Similar to the inpatient RNHCI benefit, the physician role in
> certifying and ordering the home benefit is replaced with the use of
> the RNHCI utilization review committee to review the need for care and
> plan for initial and continued care in the home setting. The home
> benefit will also require a prompt review of admission to the home
> service, since the patient must be fully eligible (have a health
> condition that keeps them confined to the home (42CFR409.42(a), have
> health needs that can be met with intermittent care, and have a valid
> election) before billable services can be rendered and Medicare
> payment requested. Additionally the utilization review committee is
> responsible for review and approval of care plans and orders for DME
> items, and review of the need for the continuation of services.
>
> As in the original RNHCI benefit, Medicare will only pay for
> nonmedical services in the home, but not for those religious items or
> services provided by the RNHCI.
>
> Medicare covers these items and services for dates of service from
> January 1, 2005 through December 30, 2006. Total Medicare payments
> under this benefit for each calendar year during this period are
> limited to \$700,000.

# - Coverage and Payment of Durable Medical Equipment Under the RNHCI Home Benefit

> **(Rev. 45, Issued: 02-10-06; Effective: 05-11-06;Implementation:
> 05-11-06)**
>
> Medicare covers a defined list of nonmedical DME items for RNHCI home
> services that are comparable to items used in the inpatient RNHCI
> setting and could be provided by an HHA. The DME items include canes,
> crutches, walkers, commodes, a standard wheelchair, hospital beds,
> bedpans, and urinals. Those RNHCIs offering home services may order
> these items without a physician order and without compromising the
> beneficiary election for RNHCI care. The need for each item of DME
> ordered must be supported by the RNHCI patient's plan of care for the
> home setting and the RNHCI
>
> nurses' notes for home services. It must be noted that the benefit is
> applicable only to what we shall refer to as "nonmedical DME items"
> and does not include any of the related services provided by RNHCI
> staff members.
>
> The RNHCI shall establish a payment arrangement with one or more DME
> suppliers to obtain any of the items on the DME list (below) they may
> require for a beneficiary. The supplier will provide the items and
> related instructions on use to the beneficiary/family/care giver. The
> RNHCI will submit claims for these DME items to the RNHCI specialty
> FI.
>
> The RNHCI must stress to suppliers that DME claims are not to be

# - Coverage and Payment of Home Visits Under the RNHCI Home Benefit

> **(Rev. 45, Issued: 02-10-06; Effective: 05-11-06;Implementation:
> 05-11-06)**
>
> Medicare covers intermittent RNHCI nursing visits provided in the home
> to RNHCI beneficiaries. The RNHCI nursing personnel may be skilled in
> ministering to a beneficiary's religious needs (not covered by
> Medicare), but do not have the training or nursing skill sets required
> of credentialed/licensed health care professionals (e.g., registered
> nurse). While RNHCI nurses may provide tender loving care, they are
> focused primarily on religious healing and meeting basic beneficiary
> needs for assistance with activities of daily living (e.g., bathing,
> toileting, dressing, ambulation), as part of creating a milieu for
> religious healing. The care provided by an RNHCI nurse is not at the
> level of either a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse. The
> physical care provided by an RNHCI nurse is at a level that could be
> considered as supportive, but decidedly not "skilled" as defined by
> the Medicare program.
>
> For purposes of payment for RNHCI nursing services in the home, the
> following services are comparable to the services of HHAs that are not
> RNHCIs (e.g., the RNHCI nurse and the home health aide share the
> following basic tasks):

-   Assist with activities of daily living which include: ambulation,
    > bed to chair transfer, and assist with range of motion exercises;
    > bathing, shampoo, nail care and dressing; feeding and nutrition;
    > and toileting;

-   Light housekeeping, incident to visit

-   Documenting visit

> By comparison the home health aide will routinely perform additional
> medically oriented services (e.g., observation and reporting of
> existing medical conditions, taking and reporting vital signs, and
> using basic infection control procedures).
>
> Due to the uniqueness of RNHCI nursing in the Medicare program,
> Medicare pays for RNHCI nursing visits at a percentage of the HHAs
> "low utilization payment adjustment" (LUPA) rate for home health
> aides. Only a visit by an RNHCI nurse to a home will be considered as
> billable to Medicare. A visit is defined as an episode in which an
> RNHCI nurse will render physical care to an RHNCI beneficiary in the
> home setting. The visit is a single billable unit that is not
> influenced by the number of involved caregivers or the duration of the
> episode. The difference in skill levels and the incorporation of RNHCI
> religious activity (noncovered by Medicare) into a visit, resulted in
> a payment rate that is 80% of the home health aide rate adjusted by
> metropolitan service area (MSA) wage index rate for the involved
> RNHCI.
>
> RNHCI nursing visits are paid using the LUPA system even in situations
> where the involved patient would not be classified as low utilization.
> The HHAs have moved to PPS, which is constructed on the medical model
> and therefore inappropriate for RNHCI use. The same
> "labor"/"non-labor" portions applied in the HHA PPS will be used for
> calculating the RNHCI nursing visit payments.
>
> Example of LUPA Payment: An RNHCI in Baltimore, MD, provides twelve
> RNHCI nursing visits over the course of a 30 day period.
