# - General Program Benefits

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled Act (title XVIII of the
> Social Security Act), known as \"Medicare,\" has made available to
> nearly every American 65 years of age and older a broad program of
> health insurance designed to assist the nation\'s elderly to meet
> hospital, medical, and other health costs. Health insurance coverage
> has also been extended to persons under age 65 qualifying as disabled
> and those having end stage renal disease (ESRD) or Lou Gehrig\'s
> disease. The program includes two related health insurance
> programs\--hospital insurance (HI) (Part A) and supplementary medical
> insurance (SMI) (Part B).

1.  []{#_bookmark2 .anchor}**- Hospital Insurance (Part A) for Inpatient
    Hospital, Hospice, Home Health and Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF)
    Services - A Brief Description *(Rev. 94, Issued: 10-16-15,
    Effective: 11-16-15, Implementation: 11-16-15)***

> Hospital insurance is designed to help patients defray the expenses
> incurred by hospitalization
>
> and related care. In addition to inpatient hospital benefits, hospital
> insurance covers posthospital extended care in SNFs and posthospital
> care furnished by a home health agency in the patient\'s home. Blood
> clotting factors, for hemophilia patients competent to use such
> factors to control bleeding without medical or other supervision, and
> items related to the administration of such
>
> factors, are also a Part A benefit for beneficiaries in a covered Part
> A stay. The purpose of these additional benefits is to provide
> continued treatment after hospitalization and to encourage the
> appropriate use of more economical alternatives to inpatient hospital
> care. Program payments for services rendered to beneficiaries by
> providers (i.e., hospitals, SNFs, and home health
>
> agencies) are generally made to the provider. In each benefit period,
> payment may be made for up to 90 inpatient hospital days, and 100 days
> of posthospital extended care services.
>
> Hospices also provide Part A hospital insurance services such as
> short-term inpatient care. In order to be eligible to elect hospice
> care under Medicare, an individual must be entitled to Part A of
> Medicare and be certified as being terminally ill. An individual is
> considered to be terminally ill if the individual has a medical
> prognosis that his or her life expectancy is 6 months or less if the
> illness runs its normal course.
>
> The Part A benefit categories *of* inpatient hospital services *and*
> SNF services are *each* subject to separate and mutually exclusive day
> limits, so that the use of benefit days under one of these benefits
> does not affect the number of benefit days that remain available under
> the other.
>
> *Accordingly*, the 90 days of inpatient hospital benefits (plus 60
> nonrenewable lifetime reserve days \-- see Pub. 100-02, Medicare
> Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 5) that are available to a beneficiary
> in a hospital *do not* count against the 100 days of posthospital
> extended care benefits that are available in a SNF, and vice-versa.

# - Home Health Services

## (Rev. 28; Issued: 08-12-05; Effective/Implementation: 09-12-05)

> To qualify for home health benefits under either Part A or Part B of
> the program, a beneficiary must be confined to his/her home, under the
> care of a physician, and in need of skilled nursing services on an
> intermittent basis, physical therapy, or speech-language pathology
> services.
>
> Being \"confined to the home\" does not mean a beneficiary can never
> leave the home. See
>
> chapter 7 of the Benefit Policy publication for the definition of
> homebound. A beneficiary who requires one or more of these services in
> the treatment of his/her illness or injury and otherwise qualifies for
> home health benefits is eligible to have payment made on his/her
> behalf for the skilled nursing, physical therapy or speech-language
> pathology services he needs, as well as for any of the other home
> health services specified in the law. These services include
> occupational therapy, medical social services, the use of medical
> supplies and medical appliances, and the part-time or intermittent
> services of home health aides. Conversely, a patient who does not
> require intermittent skilled nursing or physical therapy or
> speech-language pathology services cannot qualify to have payment made
> under the program for any home health services furnished him. Excluded
> as home health services are the costs of housekeepers, food service
> arrangements, and transportation to outpatient facilities.
>
> To be covered, the home health services must be needed for a condition
> for which the patient required inpatient hospital services or extended
> care services. See the chapter 7 of the Benefit Policy publication for
> a description of services covered. Discharge from the hospital must
> have occurred in a month in which the patient has attained age 65 or
> was entitled to health insurance benefits under the disability or
> chronic renal disease provisions of the law.
>
> Home health services are services provided by a home health agency or
> by others under arrangements with such an agency. A home health agency
> is a public agency or private organization which is primarily engaged
> in providing skilled nursing and other therapeutic
>
> services. Where applicable the agency must be licensed under State or
> local law, or be approved by the State or local licensing agency as
> meeting the licensing standards. Examples of home health agencies are
> visiting nurse associations, official health agencies, and
> hospital-based home care programs. To participate in the health
> insurance program, a home health agency must meet certain other
> requirements included in the law as well as health and safety
> conditions prescribed by the Secretary of the Department of Health and
> Human Services. It may not qualify under hospital insurance, however,
> if it is primarily engaged in the treatment of mental diseases; such
> an agency may qualify only under supplementary medical insurance.
>
> Home health services are usually furnished on a visiting basis in a
> place of residence used as the individual\'s home. However, outpatient
> services in a hospital, SNF, or rehabilitation center are covered home
> health services, if arranged for by a home health agency, when
> equipment is required that cannot be made available in the patient\'s
> home.
>
> The services of an intern or resident-in-training are covered if the
> agency has an affiliation with or is under common control of a
> hospital providing such medical services and the agency bills for such
> services.
>
> Prior to July 1, 1981, home health services under hospital insurance
> included up to 100 home health visits, after the beginning of one
> benefit period and before the beginning of the next. The visits must
> have been furnished to a patient within 1 year of his/her most recent
> discharge from a hospital where he was an inpatient for at least 3
> consecutive calendar days (counting the day of admission, but not the
> day of discharge). If, after his/her hospitalization, he had a covered
> stay in a SNF, the 1 year during which the patient may receive home
> health services began with the discharge from the SNF. A plan of
> treatment must have been established within 14 days after the hospital
> or SNF discharge. Home health services were also provided under
> supplementary
>
> medical insurance where the 100-visit limit under Part A was exceeded.
>
> Effective July 1, 1981, the 100-visit limitation under Parts A and B,
> and the prior inpatient stay requirement under Part A were eliminated.
> In addition, a person could qualify for home health services based on
> his or her need for skilled nursing services on an intermittent basis,
> physical therapy, speech-language pathology services, or occupational
> therapy. Effective December 1, 1981, occupational therapy was
> eliminated as a basis for entitlement to home health services.
>
> However, if a person has otherwise qualified for home health services
> because of the need for skilled nursing care, physical therapy or
> speech-language pathology services, the patient\'s eligibility for
> home health services may be extended solely on the basis of the
> continuing need for occupational therapy.
>
> Effective January 1, 1998, the first 100 visits must be paid under
> Part A if the beneficiary is entitled under Part A, and the remainder
> of the visits may be paid under Part B.

# - Supplementary Medical Insurance (Part B) - A Brief Description

## (Rev. 28; Issued: 08-12-05; Effective/Implementation: 09-12-05)

> To obtain SMI, an eligible individual must enroll during an enrollment
> period and pay the required premiums. An individual is eligible to
> enroll if they are entitled to HI or are 65 years of age and a citizen
> or resident alien who meets certain residence requirements. SMI
> provides for payment to participating providers for furnishing covered
> services after a yearly cash deductible is met. The voluntary medical
> insurance plan is designed to supplement the basic hospital
>
> insurance coverage. It provides coverage for home health visits not
> available under hospital insurance (e.g., no Part A entitlement or
> visits after the first 100 visits) and for medical and other health
> services. Payment may not be made under Part B for any service that
> may be paid under Part A. However, where payment is not possible under
> Part A (e.g., no Part A entitlement or
>
> benefits are exhausted) payment may be made under Part B if the
> service is covered.
>

# - Basis for Payment

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> (See Claims Processing, Pub 100-04 for a description of the basis for
> payment for the various services.)

# - Administration of the Medicare Program - Introduction

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The conduct of the program has been delegated by the Secretary of the
> Department of Health and Human Services to the Administrator of the
> Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Congress has also
> provided substantial administrative roles for the States and for
> voluntary insurance organizations in recognition of their experience
> in the health care and insurance fields.
>
> The law does not permit the Federal Government to exercise supervision
> or control over the
>
> practice of medicine, the manner in which medical services are
> provided, and the administration or operation of medical facilities.
> The patient is free to choose any qualified institution, agency, or
> person offering him/her services. The responsibility for treatment and
> the control of care remains with the individual\'s physician and the
> hospital or other facility or agency furnishing
>
> services. The individual may keep or obtain any other health insurance
> he/she desires including the choice to enroll in a Medicare+Choice
> plan. More information about Medicare+Choice plans is in the
> [[Medicare Managed Care
> Manual]{.underline}.](http://cms.hhs.gov/manuals/116_mmc/mmc116index.asp)

# - Financing the Program

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Part A is financed through separate payroll contributions paid by
> employees, employers, and self-employed persons. The proceeds are
> deposited to the account of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund,
> which is used only for hospital insurance benefits and administrative
> expenses. Federal employees and State and local employees who do not
> pay the full FICA tax must pay the HI portion; they are not eligible
> for monthly Social Security or railroad retirement benefits. The cost
> of providing Part A benefits to other persons who are not Social
> Security or railroad retirement beneficiaries is met by appropriations
> to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund from general revenues or
> through premium payments.
>
> Part B is financed by monthly premiums of those who voluntarily enroll
> in the program and by the Federal Government which makes contributions
> from general revenues. All premiums and Government contributions are
> deposited in a separate account known as the Federal Supplementary
> Medical Trust Fund. Money from this fund is used only to pay for Part
> B benefits and administrative expenses.

# - Discrimination Prohibited

## (Rev. 28; Issued: 08-12-05; Effective/Implementation: 09-12-05)

> Participating providers of Part A services under the supplementary
> medical insurance program (e.g., hospitals, SNFs, HHAs, hospices,
> outpatient physical therapy, comprehensive outpatient
>
> rehabilitation facilities (CORFs), occupational therapy and
> speech-language pathology providers, and renal dialysis facilities)
> must comply with the requirements of title VI of the Civil Rights Act
> of 1964. Under the provisions of that Act, a participating provider is
> prohibited from making a distinction on the grounds of race, color, or
> national origin, in the treatment of patients, the use
>
> of equipment, other facilities, and the assignment of personnel to
> provide services. The DHHS is responsible for investigating complaints
> of noncompliance.

# - Fraud and Abuse - General

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Providers and suppliers have an obligation, under law, to conform to
> the requirements of the Medicare program. Fraud and abuse committed
> against the program may be prosecuted under various provisions of the
> United States Code and could result in the imposition of restitution,
> fines, and, in some instances, imprisonment. In addition, there is
> also a range of administrative
>
> sanctions (such as exclusion from participation in the program) and
> civil monetary penalties that may be imposed when facts and
> circumstances warrant such action.
>
> Following are definitions and examples of fraud and abuse. These
> definitions and examples give a better understanding of the types of
> practices that are forbidden, under law, in the Medicare program.

# - Definition and Examples of Fraud

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Fraud is defined as making false statements or representations of
> material facts in order to obtain some benefit or payment for which no
> entitlement would otherwise exist. These acts may be committed either
> for the person\'s own benefit or for the benefit of some other party.
> In order to
>
> prove that fraud has been committed against the Government, it is
> necessary to prove that fraudulent acts were performed knowingly,
> willfully, and intentionally.
>
> Examples of fraud include, but are not limited to, the following:

-   Billing for services that were not furnished and/or supplies not
    provided. This includes billing Medicare for appointments that the
    patient failed to keep;

-   Altering claims forms and/or receipts in order to receive a higher
    payment amount;

-   Duplicating billings that includes billing both the Medicare program
    and the beneficiary, Medicaid, or some other insurer in an effort to
    receive payment greater than allowed;

-   Offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving bribes, kickbacks, or
    rebates, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in order to
    induce referrals of patients or the purchase of goods or services
    that may be paid for by the Medicare program;

-   Falsely representing the nature of the services furnished. This
    encompasses describing a noncovered service in a misleading way that
    makes it appear as if a covered service was actually furnished;

-   Billing a person who has Medicare coverage for services provided to
    another person not eligible for Medicare coverage; and

-   Using another person\'s Medicare card to obtain medical care.

# - Definition and Examples of Abuse

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Abuse describes practices that, either directly or indirectly, result
> in unnecessary costs to the
>
> Medicare program. Many times abuse appears quite similar to fraud
> except that it is not possible to establish that abusive acts were
> committed knowingly, willfully, and intentionally.
>
> Following are three standards that CMS uses when judging whether
> abusive acts in billing were committed against the Medicare program:

-   Reasonable and necessary;

-   Conformance to professionally recognized standards; and

-   Provision at a fair price.

> Examples of abuse include, but are not limited to, the following:

-   Charging in excess for services or supplies;

-   Providing medically unnecessary services or services that do not
    meet professionally recognized standards;

-   Billing Medicare based on a higher fee schedule than for
    non-Medicare patients;

-   Submitting bills to Medicare that are the responsibility of other
    insurers under the Medicare secondary payer (MSP) regulation; and

-   Violating the participating physician/supplier agreement.

> Although these types of practices may initially be categorized as
> abusive in nature, under certain circumstances they may develop into
> fraud if there is evidence that the subject was knowingly and
> willfully conducting an abusive practice.

# - Federal Government Administration of the Health Insurance Program

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The DHHS has overall responsibility for administering the hospital
> insurance and voluntary SMI programs. Two major agencies - CMS and the
> Public Health Service - are involved in specified administrative
> functions.

# - CMS Responsibilities

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The CMS is responsible for policy formulation. The central and
> regional offices are responsible for the general management and
> operation of the program. In brief, CMS\'s responsibilities include
> the following:

-   Determining an individual\'s entitlement to benefits in consultation
    with the Social Security Administration (SSA);

-   Determining the nature and duration of services for which a
    beneficiary\'s benefits may be paid;

-   Establishing, maintaining, and administering agreements with State
    agencies, providers of services, and A/B MACs (A) and (HHH);

-   Establishing operational policy for contractors;

-   Developing operational instructions and official interpretations of
    policy for contractors;

-   Formulating major policies regarding conditions of participation for
    providers in consultation with the Public Health Service;

-   Developing and maintaining statistical research and actuarial
    programs; and

-   Managing general finances of the program; and

-   Managing the Medicare Premium Collection Operation.

> The regional offices are responsible for assuring that contractors
> meet applicable Federal requirements under the provisions of their
> contracts. They also:

-   Provide liaison, direction, and technical assistance to contractors
    in the day-to-day management of their operations;

-   Interpret CMS guidelines, policies, and procedures applicable to
    contractor activities;

-   Analyze contractor budgets and spending patterns to assure that
    funds are economically and appropriately utilized;

-   Conduct assessments of contractor operations;

-   Review contractor actions; and

-   Provide feedback to each contractor.

    1.  # - Public Health Service Responsibilities

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The Public Health Service is responsible for administering the
> professional health aspects of the program. In brief, its
> responsibilities include the following:

-   Consulting and recommending to CMS matters concerning the
    development of health and safety standards and other guidelines
    needed for determining whether providers of services meet the
    conditions of participation under the program;

-   Consulting and advising State agencies concerning the application of
    standards for providers; and

-   Coordinating programs and activities necessary in studying the
    utilization of services under the program.

    1.  # - State Agencies

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The States, by agreement with the Secretary, are assigned significant
> administrative functions to the extent that each is willing and
> capable of discharging such responsibilities.

# - Certification by State Agencies

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Facilities desiring to participate in either the Medicare or Medicaid
> programs must meet participation conditions for certification. State
> agencies certify to DHHS whether providers satisfy, and continue to
> satisfy, their respective conditions of participation in the Medicare
> and Medicaid programs. The Secretary, DHHS, certifies facilities
> requesting participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. States
> certify those facilities that request participation in the Medicaid
> program only.
>
> The State function of making certifications is intended to be a
> natural adjunct to ongoing State activities (such as the licensing of
> health care facilities and the setting of standards).

# - Consultation by State Agencies

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> A State consults with providers of services that need and request
> participation condition
>
> assistance. For Medicare participation, the Secretary, DHHS, must
> approve the consultation service rendered by the State certifying
> agency.

# - Coordination by State Agencies

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> A State coordinates activities with other State programs that involve
> payment for health care, quality of care, and location of health
> facilities. Coordinating these activities is essential in
>
> assuring effective and economical use of existing State facilities and
> trained personnel and to prevent duplication of effort.

40. []{#_bookmark19 .anchor}**- Role of A/B MACs (A) and (HHH)**

## (Rev. 28; Issued: 08-12-05; Effective/Implementation: 09-12-05)

> The A/B MAC (A) and (HHH) is a public or private agency or
> organization that has entered into an agreement with CMS to enroll
> legitimate providers into the Medicare program and process Medicare
> claims under both Part A and Part B services under the supplementary
> medical insurance program (e.g., hospitals, SNFs, HHAs, hospices,
> CORFs, OPTs, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology
> providers, and ESRD facilities).
>
> A/B MACs (A) and (HHH) make payments to providers. The amount of
> payment to a provider is restricted to the lower of the billed charge,
> the reasonable cost of covered services or the fee schedule amount.
> Hospices are paid on a per diem amount that is prospectively set. SNFs
> and HHAs are paid based on a Prospective Payment System (PPS). (See
> Provider Reimbursement Manual, Part 1, §§2800ff.)
>
> Hospitals are paid based on the PPS. Under this system, Medicare
> payment is made at a
>
> predetermined, specific rate for each hospital discharge. This
> statement applies to inpatient for acute care hospitals and to
> inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. Whereas inpatient acute and rehab
> PPS payment is based on the discharge date, Outpatient PPS (OPPS)
> payments are based on Ambulatory Patient Classification payment for
> the date of service.
>
> The amount of payment to other types of providers is restricted to the
> lesser of (a) the reasonable cost of covered services and items; or
> (b) the billed charges with respect to such services; or (c) the fee
> schedule amount.
>
> In addition, A/B MACs (A) and (HHH) assist in applying safeguards
> against unnecessary use of covered services, furnish consultative
> services to serve as a center for communicating with providers,
> conduct audits of provider records, assist in the beneficiary appeals
> process, and provide information and advice to institutions and
> organizations that wish to qualify as providers of services.
>
> (See

# - A/B MAC (A) and (HHH) Service to HHAs

## (Rev. )

> All HHAs bill the assigned A/B MAC (HHH) and are paid by that MAC.
>
> In the case of HHAs and hospices based in another Medicare provider
> (e.g., a hospital or SNF), audit, cost report settlement, and other
> fiscal functions (such as setting interim payment rates) are performed
> by the A/B MAC (A) serving the parent provider.

# 50 - Role of A/B MACs (B) and DME MACs

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The law requires the Secretary, DHHS, to enter into contracts with A/B
> MACs (B) and DME MACs to serve in the operation and administration of
> the non-provider Part B program. A/B MACs (B) enroll physicians,
> non-physician health care practitioners and other entities that will
> submit claims to the A/B MAC (B), and process Medicare claims and make
> payments for services and supplies covered by Part B. Other major
> functions include, for example, controlling over-utilization and

>
> DME MACs have been given the responsibility of processing durable
> medical equipment, prosthetic, orthotic, and supply (DMEPOS) claims.
> See Claims Processing Manual, chapter 1, for description of
> jurisdiction.

# - Background and Responsibilities of the Peer Review Organization (PRO)

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> Section 1153 of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires the
> Secretary to enter into contracts with physician-approved or
> physician-access organizations defined as PROs.
>
> The PROs are organizations who are responsible for monitoring the
> quality of care provided to Medicare patients by hospitals, SNFs, home
> health agencies, Medicare+Choice plans, and other types of health care
> providers.
>
> PRO review is governed by titles XI and XVIII of the Act as amended,
> and by regulations contained in:

-   42 CFR 411 - Limitation on liability;

-   42 CFR 412 - Outlier review, diagnosis related group (DRG)
    validation, and hospital notices of non coverage;

-   42 CFR 417.605 - Immediate PRO review of Health Maintenance
    Organization (HMO)/Competitive Medical Plan (CMP) notices of
    discharge;

-   42 CFR 422.622 - Immediate review of Medicare+Choice discharge
    notices;

-   42 CFR 475 - Definition of eligible organizations and area
    designation;

-   42 CFR 476 - Assumption and conduct of review;

-   42 CFR 478 - PRO reconsideration and appeals;

-   42 CFR 480 - Disclosure of information;

-   42 CFR 482 - Hospital conditions of participation; and

-   42 CFR 1004 - PRO recommendations of sanctions.

    1.  # - Purpose of PRO Review for the Individual Medicare Beneficiaries

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The PROs review items or services provided to Medicare beneficiaries
> to determine:

-   Whether services provided or proposed to be provided are reasonable
    and medically necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of illness
    or injury, or to improve functioning of a malformed body member, or
    for prevention of an illness, or for the palliation and management
    of terminal illness;

-   Whether those services furnished or proposed to be furnished on an
    inpatient basis could be effectively furnished on an outpatient
    basis, or in an inpatient health care facility of a different type;

-   Medical necessity, reasonableness, and appropriateness of inpatient
    hospital care for which additional payment is sought under the
    outlier provisions of PPS;

-   Whether a hospital has misrepresented admission or discharge
    information, or has taken an action that results in the unnecessary
    admission of an individual entitled to benefits under Part A,
    unnecessary multiple admissions of an individual, or other
    inappropriate medical or other practices with respect to
    beneficiaries, or billing for services furnished to beneficiaries;

-   The validity of diagnostic and procedural information supplied by
    the provider to the A/B MAC (A) for payment purposes;

-   The completeness and adequacy of hospital care provided; and

-   Whether the quality of services meets professionally recognized
    standards of health care.

> These activities enable PROs to determine whether Medicare payment may
> be made for the
>
> services claimed and to identify and initiate corrective action where
> appropriate. PROs have the authority to deny Medicare payment for
> medically inappropriate and unnecessary admissions.
>
> They also investigate individual beneficiary complaints about the
> quality of care received.

# - PRO Responsibility for the Overall Approach to Health Care

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> In addition to individual case review, PROs also help providers
> improve the overall approach to health care for Medicare
> beneficiaries.
>
> This function includes the following activities:

-   Using clinical and other data bases to examine patterns of care and
    outcomes, rather than focusing on isolated cases;

-   Identifying systemic variations of concern or interest by monitoring
    patterns of care and outcomes;

-   Working with providers to identify provider-specific root causes of
    systemic variations; and

-   Working cooperatively with the health care community to measurably
    improve the processes and outcomes of care for Medicare
    beneficiaries.

# - Other PRO Responsibilities

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

A.  **Responsibilities Prior to Review**

> The PROs are responsible for:

-   Specifying in their plan and instructions to practitioners and
    providers the type of evidence they require to document the care
    ordered or furnished to provide medically necessary, appropriate,
    and quality health care services; and

-   Applying professionally developed criteria for providing care,
    diagnosis, and treatment based upon typical patterns of practice
    within their geographic area to evaluate the medical necessity,
    quality, or appropriateness of services ordered or furnished.

## Ongoing Review Activities

> As a part of their ongoing review activities, PROs must:

-   Notify the appropriate agency of the State or Federal government
    when they become aware of situations which appear to be improper,
    but which do not fall within their review responsibilities (e.g.,
    poor quality care in a renal dialysis center);

-   Use their authority or influence to enlist the support of other
    professional or Government agencies to ensure that all providers and
    practitioners for which they have review responsibilities comply
    with their obligations (see §1156 of the Act.); and

-   Perform beneficiary and physician outreach activities.

## Responsibilities as a Result of PRO Review

> To act upon information they obtain as a result of their review
> activities, PROs must:

-   Provide information on results of their review (e.g., annual report,
    periodic meetings with providers/practitioners);

-   Identify and seek correction of situations that, if continued, would
    result in violations under §1156 of the Act;

-   Submit reports to the Office of the Inspector General on providers
    and practitioners found to have substantially violated an obligation
    in a substantial number of cases, or to have grossly and flagrantly
    violated an obligation in one or more instances. This includes

> referring certain cases to State licensing boards.

## Additional Activities

> PROs perform all other activities specified in the Scope of Work,
> including any modifications, CMS regulations and instructions, and
> relevant statutory provisions.

## Payme nt Error Pre vention Program (PEPP)

> In order to reduce inpatient PPS payment errors, PROs must initiate a
> program of Payment Error Prevention Projects (PEPPs). CMS defines the
> payment error rate as the number of dollars found to be paid in error
> out of the total of all dollars paid for inpatient PPS services. CMS
> provides State-specific error rates to PROs to evaluate performance.

# - Statutory Obligations of Practitioners and Other Persons

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> It is the obligation of any health care practitioner or other person
> who furnishes or orders health care items or services that may be
> reimbursed under Medicare, to ensure that to the extent of his or her
> authority, those services are:

-   Furnished economically and only when and to the extent medically
    necessary;

-   Of a quality that meets professionally recognized standards of
    health care; and

-   Supported by evidence of the medical necessity and quality of the
    services in the form and fashion that the reviewing PRO may
    reasonably require (including copies of the necessary documentation)
    to ensure that the practitioner or other person is meeting the
    obligations imposed by Section 1156(a) of the Act.

> These obligations apply whether payment is made directly to the
> provider (i.e., assignment) or to the beneficiary, or even if payment
> is not made.

# - Responsibilities of Designated Agents Working With PROs;

> **Organizations Subcontracted for Review**

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The PRO has ultimate responsibility for monitoring the compliance of
> practitioners and providers with statutory obligations. It is not
> relieved of any of the responsibility under the sanction regulations
> in the event of non-performance by an organization with which it has
> subcontracted for review.
>
> An organization with which the PRO subcontracts to carry out review
> functions is responsible for:

-   Ensuring that practitioners and other persons meet their obligations
    with respect to the items and services it reviews; and

-   Reporting to the PRO (primary contractor) those instances where it
    appears a violation of an obligation may have occurred or is
    occurring.

# 70 - Institutional Planning and Budgeting

## (Rev. 1, 09-11-02)

> The Social Security Act requires each provider, as a condition of
> participation under Medicare, to have a written overall plan and
> budget reflecting an annual operating budget and a capital
> expenditures plan (that covers at least a 3-year period including the
> year to which the operating budget is applicable). For this
> requirement, provider means hospital, critical access hospital, SNF,
> comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility, home health agency,
> or hospice program.
>
> The annual operating budget will include all anticipated income and
> expenses related to items which would under generally accepted
> accounting principles be considered income and expense items. The
> capital expenditure plan would be expected to include and identify in
> detail the anticipated sources of finance for, the objectives of, each
> anticipated expenditure in excess of
>
> \$l00,000 related to acquisition of land, the improvement of land,
> buildings, and equipment, and the replacement, modernization, and
> expansion of the buildings and equipment which would, under generally
> accepted accounting principles, be considered capital items.
>
> The overall budget and plan will be prepared under the direction of
> the provider\'s governing body by a committee consisting of
> representatives of the governing body, administrative staff and if
> any, the medical staff. Further, it will be reviewed and updated at
> least annually. The purpose of the requirement is to assure that
> providers carry on budgeting and substance by the Government or any of
> its agents.

# 80 - CMS Managed Modules for Software Programs and Pricing/Coding Files

## (Rev. 2, 2-6-04)

> The CMS Managed Modules contains scheduled release dates for software
> programs and pricing/coding files.
>
> Medicare contractors will be receiving subsequent quarterly updates of
> the CMS Managed Modules via a Recurring Update Notification.
