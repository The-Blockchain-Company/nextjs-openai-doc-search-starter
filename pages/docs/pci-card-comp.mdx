> annual CPSA Company fee and continued compliance with applicable CPSA
> Requirements.
>
> A CPSA Employee must requalify with PCI SSC on an annual basis by
> their requalification date for each of their CPSA Program
> qualifications. In order to requalify:

###### Each CPSA-L must:

(a) Complete at least three (3) Logical PCI Card Production Assessments
    > for different facilities over the previous one-year period
    > ***and*** complete PCI SSC computer-based CPSA-L training
    > course/exam.

##### *or*

(b) Successfully complete PCI SSC instructor-led CPSA Logical training
    > course and exam.

###### Each CPSA-P must:

(a) Complete at least three (3) Physical PCI Card Production Assessments
    > for different facilities over the previous one- year period
    > ***and*** complete PCI SSC computer-based CPSA Physical training
    > course/exam.

##### *or*

(b) Successfully complete PCI SSC instructor-led CPSA-P training course
    > and exam.

> The annual requalification date is based upon the CPSA Employee's
> *previous qualification date*. Requalification requires proof of
> training successfully completed and continued compliance with
> applicable CPSA Requirements. Regardless of when the CPSA Employee
> completes their requalification requirements within the grace period
> described below, the requalification date remains the same. *For
> example, a one-year requalification for a certification with a current
> qualification date of 15 November of a given year will be changed to
> 15 November one year later upon successful completion of requirements,
> regardless of whether the requalification was completed on 31 October
> or 25 November of that year.*

#### *Requalification Timeframe*

> To help ensure adequate time to complete requalification requirements,
> CPSA Employees should note:

-   Registration for requalification training must be completed prior to
    > the CPSA Employee's qualification expiration date. A candidate who
    > is not registered prior to that expiry date must re-enroll as a
    > new candidate and successfully complete Instructor-led training.

-   A two-week grace period is provided beyond the candidate's expiry
    > date in order to complete requalification training; however,
    > candidates will be removed from the CPSA Assessor List and will
    > not be qualified by PCI SSC during this time and will not be
    > requalified until the requalification exam is successfully
    > completed.

-   Access to the requalification course and exam will be granted only
    > after payment is processed by PCI SSC, and candidates will have
    > access to the exam up to four calendar weeks prior to, and two
    > calendar weeks past their expiration date.

-   If a candidate is registered for requalification training and fails
    > to take the training or fails the exam within the defined period,
    > payment will be forfeited in full and the individual must reapply
    > as a new CPSA Employee candidate.

## Fees

> Each CPSA Company must pay an annual CPSA Company fee to maintain
> qualification as a CPSA Company. The CPSA Company fee as well as
> applicable CPSA Employee training fees are specified on the Website in
> the *PCI SSC Programs Fee Schedule* and are subject to change.
>
> All fees must be paid in US dollars (USD) by check, by credit card, or
> by wire transfer to the PCI SSC bank account specified for such
> purpose on the lower half of the invoice.
>
> The option for credit card payment is not offered on CPSA Company fee
> invoices. However, the option can be added to the invoice upon
> request. A fee of 3% of the total invoice will be added for
> processing.

## CPSA Continuing Professional Education (CPE)

-   CPSA Employees with active industry certifications^1^ are not
    > requir[]{#_bookmark15 .anchor}ed to provide proof of CPEs to PCI
    > SSC.

-   A CPSA Employee with no active industry certifications^1^ must earn
    > a minimum of 10 CPE credits per year in accordance with the
    > current version of the PCI SSC CPE Maintenance Guide.

> ^1^ Industry certifications refer to those in List A and List B from
> Section 3.2 of the *CPSA Qualification Requirements*.

## Primary Contact

> The CPSA Company must []{#_bookmark16 .anchor}designate a Primary
> Contact (via CPSA Company Application) to act as communication liaison
> to PCI SSC. The Primary Contact has sole authorization to submit, add,
> change, or delete assessor requests to PCI SSC related to the Program.
> PCI SSC must be notified immediately in writing if there is a change
> in the Primary Contact. The Primary Contact is not required to be an
> assessor.

> Notices from PCI SSC to the Primary Contact may be communicated via
> the Assessor Portal, e-mail, registered mail, or any other method
> permitted by the CPSA Agreement.
>
> It is the responsibility of the Primary Contact to respond to PCI SCC
> in a timely manner.

## Assessor Portal

> The Assessor Portal provides visibility and edit capability to CPSA
> Company account information and CPSA Employee details. It also
> provides information that is beneficial to CPSA Employees and helps
> facilitate their continued qualification. Qualified users are
> encouraged to review the information available via the Assessor Portal
> on a regular basis.
>
> The Primary Contact is given initial access to the Assessor Portal
> once they complete and submit the online registration form on the
> Website.
>
> Greater access to the Assessor Portal is granted to the Primary
> Contact once the company is qualified as a CPSA Company. CPSA
> Employees receive credentials and log-on instructions upon passing the
> CPSA Employee training exam, and PCI SSC enters their grades into the
> database. Primary Contacts receive a higher-level access than other
> employees.

# PCI Card Production Security Assessment Process

> The policies and procedures by which compliance assessments are
> conducted are largely determined by the Participating Payment Brands
> but generally consist of the following milestones. The following
> sections describe what is a Participating Payment Brand responsibility
> and what PCI has defined as a requirement for the assessment process:

-   Assessment Scheduling

-   Assessment Preparation

-   Facility Assessment

-   Documenting the Assessment Results

-   Assessment Result Submission

-   Non-compliance Finding Remediation

-   Evidence Retention

-   Security Incident Response

> CPSA Employees must work only on those PCI Card Production Assessments
> for which they are qualified by PCI SSC, have appropriate skills,
> including technology and language, and have an appropriate
> understanding of the client's business.

## Assessment Scheduling

> To demonstrate compliance with the PCI Card Production Security
> Requirements, Card Production Entities may be required to have
> periodic PCI Card Production Assessments conducted as required by each
> Participating Payment Brand.

## Assessment Preparation

> To prepare for the assessment the assessor is expected to review the
> findings from the previous assessment. The assessor will determine the
> audit scope based on Card Production activities performed. The Card
> Production Entity must have completed the self-assessment portion of
> the Card Production ROC.

## Facility Assessments

> PCI Card Production Assessments are required to be conducted by a CPSA
> Company through its CPSA Employees, in accordance with the PCI Card
> Production Security Requirements, which contain requirements, testing
> procedures, and guidance to ensure that the intent of each requirement
> is understood.
>
> Compliance with the PCI Card Production Security Requirements
> (Physical and Logical) is conducted onsite. Any controls that are
> assessed offsite must be identified and the results documented in the
> Card Production ROC. The Card Production ROC must accurately represent
> the assessed environment and the security controls evaluated by the
> CPSA Employee.
>
> The use of remote assessment methods may be a suitable alternative in
> scenarios where an onsite assessment is not feasible.
>
> Please refer to the *PCI SSC Remote Assessment Guidelines and
> Procedures* for both guidelines and procedures that may be adopted to
> determine whether all or part(s) of the facility assessments can be
> conducted remotely.
>
> Prior to the engagement, the CPSA Company must consult with the
> Participating Payment Brands to determine any compliance impacts
> associated with the use of remote assessments.

## Documenting the Security Assessment Results

> For each PCI Card Production Assessment, the resulting Card Production
> and Provisioning Report on Compliance (Card Production ROC) must
> utilize the most current Card Production ROC Reporting Template then
> in effect. When the Card Production Security Requirements and/or the
> associated ROC is updated, the document version in effect will be
> determined by the implementation schedule announced for each update.
> The Card Production ROC must be accompanied by a Card Production
> Attestation of Compliance that summarizes whether the assessed entity
> is in compliance with the security requirements and identifies any
> related findings. The Card Production AOC must be signed by a duly
> authorized officer of the CPSA Company. The Card Production AOC
> summarizes the Card Production Entity that was assessed as either in
> compliance or not in compliance with the PCI Card Production Security
> Requirements, and any identified findings. The current security
> requirements and Card Production ROC and AOC Templates are available
> on the PCI Website.
>
> The intent of requiring a signature from a "duly authorized officer"
> is to ensure that the CPSA Company is aware of and has formally signed
> off on the work being done and, accordingly, recognizes its
> obligations and responsibilities in connection with that work.
> Although the signatory's job title need not include the term
> "officer," the signatory must be formally authorized by the CPSA
> Company to sign such documents on the CPSA Company's behalf and should
> be competent and knowledgeable regarding the CPSA Program and related
> requirements and duties. Each organization is different and is
> ultimately responsible for defining its own policies and job functions
> based on its own needs and culture.
>
> By signing the CPSA AOC, the assessed entity is attesting that the
> information provided in the Card Production AOC and accompanying Card
> Production and Provisioning Report on Compliance is true and accurate.
> The date on the Card Production AOC cannot predate the Card Production
> ROC.
>
> The Card Production AOC is submitted to the requesting entity/entities
> according to applicable Participating Payment Brand rules.

## Assessment Result Submission

> The CPSA Employee is expected to submit the assessment results within
> one calendar month of the completion of the facility assessment.

## Non-Compliance Finding Remediation

> Non-compliance finding remediation is determined by the Participating
> Payment Brands.

## Assessment Evidence Retention

> As per Section 4.5 "Evidence (Assessment Workpaper) Retention" of the
> CPSA Qualification Requirements, CPSA Companies must gather evidence
> to support the contents of each Card Production ROC. The CPSA Company
> must secure and maintain, for a minimum of three (3) years from the
> Card Production ROC completion date, digital and/or hard copies of
> case logs, audit results, workpapers, e-mails, interview notes, and
> any technical information---e.g., screenshots, configuration
> settings---that were created and/or obtained during the PCI Card
> Production Assessment. This information must be available upon request
> by PCI SSC and Participating Payment Brands. The CPSA Company must
> also provide a copy of the evidence-retention policy and procedures to
> PCI SSC upon request.
>
> If a Card Production Entity refuses to provide the CPSA Company with
> the documentary evidence--- for example, because it contains
> information that is sensitive or confidential to the Card Production
> Entity---the CPSA Company and the Card Production Entity should work
> together to ensure that the evidence is retained securely at the Card
> Production Entity site and as required by the CPSA Qualification
> Requirements, including being made available to PCI SSC upon request
> for a minimum of three (3) years from the date of Card Production ROC
> completion of the applicable PCI Card Production Assessment. To
> accomplish the above, the CPSA Company will need to establish a formal
> agreement with the Card Production Entity that outlines each party's
> responsibilities in the retention of evidence. Any agreement must be
> consistent with and comply with the disclosure requirements specified
> in the CPSA Agreement.
>
> Even if the actual, documented evidence is to be retained by the Card
> Production Entity, the CPSA Company must keep records to identify the
> specific evidence that was used during the PCI Card Production
> Assessment---for example, digital and/or hard copies of the documents
> or testing results that are being retained by the Card Production
> Entity. The CPSA Company's records should clearly identify which
> pieces of evidence were used for each requirement, how the evidence
> was validated, and the findings that resulted from each piece of
> evidence. The CPSA Company should retain enough Information to ensure
> that the complete, actual evidence used during the PCI Card Production
> Assessment can be identified for retrieval if needed; for example, in
> the event of an investigation or if a finding needs to be reviewed.
>
> As part of the PCI SSC's Assessor Quality Management ("AQM") CPSA
> Program audit process ("CPSA Audit"), and in other AQM
> quality-assurance ("QA") review work as needed, it is common for AQM
> to request both the CPSA Company's Workpaper Retention Policy and a
> sample of PCI Card Production Assessment workpapers. This is to ensure
> the CPSA Company has a current documented, implemented Workpaper
> Retention process consistent with the requirements defined in the CPSA
> Qualification Requirements---including the appropriate level of
> detailed instructions with which the CPSA Employees must comply. AQM
> may additionally request blank and/or executed copies of the CPSA
> Company's Workpaper Retention Policy agreement that each CPSA Employee
> is required to sign, and may request additional evidence to
> demonstrate that all assessment results and related materials relating
> to the PCI Card Production Assessments for the sampled Card Production
> ROC were in fact retained in accordance with the procedures defined in
> the Workpaper Retention Policy prior to releasing the final Card
> Production ROC for that PCI Card Production Assessment.
>
> For details on what the CPSA Company's Evidence Retention Policy must
> include, please see Section 4.5 of the CPSA Qualification Requirements
> document available on the Website.

## Security Incident Response

> A CPSA Employee must notify a Card Production Entity if, during any
> CPSA Program related service, they become aware of an actual or
> suspected breach of cardholder data within the Card Production
> Entity's environment. In addition, the CPSA Employee must notify the
> Card Production Entity in writing of the incident and related findings
> and inform the Card Production Entity of its obligations to notify the
> Participating Payment Brands in accordance with each Participating
> Payment Brand's notification requirements. The notification must be
> retained in accordance with the CPSA Company's evidence-retention
> policy along with a summary of the incident and what actions were
> taken. The CPSA Company must have a documented process for all the
> above actions.

# Assessor Quality Management Program

> The CPSA Company must have implemented an internal quality-assurance
> program as documented in its Quality Assurance Manual. The main
> purpose of the CPSA Audit is for PCI SSC to validate two points: (1)
> that the CPSA has documented quality-assurance processes as required
> per the CPSA Qualification Requirements; and (2) that those documented
> quality-assurance processes are implemented and sustained. As part of
> CPSA Audits, PCI SSC's Assessor Quality Management (AQM) team performs
> a holistic review of the CPSA Company's internal documentation
> required by the CPSA Qualification Requirements, as well as reviews of
> Card Production ROCs to provide reasonable assurance that the
> documentation of testing procedures performed is sufficient to
> demonstrate compliance. Refer to Appendix A to understand sample
> criteria against which CPSA Companies are measured during CPSA Audits.
>
> A CPSA Audit by the PCI AQM team will result in a finding of:

-   **Satisfactory --** A notification letter will be sent with specific
    opportunities for improvement listed. Mandatory call with AQM team
    to discuss.

> *A "Satisfactory" finding indicates that the audit findings reasonably
> confirmed (1) the CPSA Company/Employee's on-going adherence to the
> current CPSA Qualification Requirements; (2) that the CPSA Company's
> quality policy documentation is implemented and maintained according
> to the CPSA Qualification Requirements; and (3) the CPSA
> Company/Employee's on-going general adherence to reporting
> requirements as evidenced by sampled CPSA ROCs.*

-   **Needs Improvement --** A notification letter will be sent with
    specific opportunities for improvement listed. Mandatory call with
    AQM team to discuss.

> *A "Needs Improvement" finding indicates that there were minor
> findings and/or opportunities for improvement identified that
> assessors should address to ensure continued adherence with program
> documentation. Still, the audit findings reasonably confirmed (1) the
> CPSA Company/Employee's on-going adherence to the current CPSA
> Qualification Requirements; (2) that the CPSA Company's quality policy
> documentation is implemented and maintained according to the CPSA
> Qualification Requirements; and (3) the CPSA Company/Employee's
> on-going general adherence to reporting requirements as evidenced by
> sampled CPSA ROCs.*

-   **Unsatisfactory --** A notification letter is sent with specific
    opportunities for improvement. Mandatory call with AQM team to
    discuss Remediation.

> *An "Unsatisfactory" finding indicates that there were serious
> findings identified during the CPSA Audit, including possible
> Violations to the CPSA Agreement. This finding will result in

## Ethics

> The CPSA []{#_bookmark28 .anchor}Company must adhere to professional
> and business ethics, perform its duties with objectivity, and limit
> sources of influence that might compromise its independent judgment in
> performing PCI Card Production Assessments.
>
> PCI SSC has adopted a *[PCI SSC Code of Professional
> Responsibility](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_SSC_Code_of_Professional_Responsibility.pdf?agreement=true&time=1477003417206)*
> (the "Code," available on the Website) to help ensure that PCI
> SSC-qualified companies and individuals adhere to high standards of
> ethical and professional conduct. All PCI SSC-qualified companies and
> individuals must advocate, adhere to, and support the Code. Among
> other things:

-   CPSA Companies and CPSA Employees are prohibited from performing PCI
    > Card Production Assessments of entities that they control or are
    > controlled by, and entities with which they are under common
    > control or in which they hold any investment.

-   CPSA Companies and CPSA Employees must not enter into any contract
    > with a Card Production Entity that guarantees a compliant CPSA
    > ROC.

-   CPSA Companies must fully disclose in the CPSA Report on Compliance
    > if they assess Card Production Entities who use any
    > security-related devices or security-related applications that
    > have been developed or manufactured by the CPSA Company, or to
    > which the CPSA Company owns the rights, or that the CPSA Company
    > has configured or manages.

-   Each CPSA Company agrees that when it (or any CPSA Employee thereof)
    > recommends remediation actions that include one of its own
    > solutions or products, the CPSA Company will also recommend other
    > market options that exist.

-   Each CPSA Company must adhere to all independence requirements as
    > established by PCI SSC. For a complete list, please see Section
    > 2.2 in the CPSA Qualification Requirements.

    1.  ## Feedback Process

> At the start of each PCI Card Production Assessment, the CPSA Company
> must direct the Card Production Entity to the CPSA Feedback Form on
> the Website and request that the Card Production Entity submit the
> completed form to PCI SSC through the PCI SSC website following the
> PCI Card Production Assessment.
>
> Any Participating Payment Brand or Card Production Entity may submit
> CPSA Feedback Forms to PCI SSC to provide feedback on a PCI Card
> Production Security Assessment, CPSA Company, or CPSA Employee.

## Security Remediation Process

> CPSA Companies that do not meet all applicable quality-assurance
> standards set by PCI SSC may be offered the option to participate in
> PCI SSC's CPSA Company Quality Remediation program ("Remediation").
> PCI SSC may offer participation in Remediation in connection with any
> quality- assurance audit, any Violation (as defined in the CPSA
> Qualification Requirements), or any other PCI SSC Program-related
> quality concerns, including but not limited to unsatisfactory feedback
> from Card Production Entities or Participating Payment Brands. The
> Remediation process includes:

-   Remediation overview call and signed Remediation Agreement.

-   Remediation Period of at least 120 calendar days.

-   CPSA Company listing on the CPSA List updated to "red" to notify
    > merchants/service providers.

-   An AQM case manager assigned to the CPSA Company to offer support as
    > it works to bring its quality level to the required baseline
    > standard of quality.

-   The expectation of strong commitment from the CPSA Company to
    > achieve successful completion.

-   Fees for review of work.

    1.  ## Revocation Process

> A CPSA Company (or any CPSA Employee thereof) may be subject to
> revocation of its PCI SSC qualification ("Revocation") if found to be
> in breach of the CPSA Agreement or other CPSA Requirements, including
> without limitation, for any of the following:

-   Failure to perform PCI Card Production Security Assessments in
    > accordance with the PCI Card Production Security Requirements or
    > CPSA Program.

-   Violation of any provision regarding non-disclosure of confidential
    > materials.

-   Failure to maintain at least one certified CPSA Employee on staff.

-   Failure to maintain physical, electronic, and/or procedural
    > safeguards to protect confidential and sensitive information.

-   Unprofessional or unethical business conduct.

-   Failure to successfully complete applicable required PCI SSC
    > training.

-   Cheating on any PCI SSC exam.

> Upon notification of pending CPSA Company Revocation by PCI SSC, the
> CPSA Company or CPSA Employee will have 30 calendar days in which to
> appeal in writing to PCI SSC.
>
> Revocation will result in the CPSA Company or CPSA Employee being
> removed from the CPSA List or search tool, as applicable.
>
> In the event of CPSA Company Revocation, the CPSA Company must
> immediately cease all advertising of its CPSA Company qualification.
> It must also immediately cease soliciting for and performing all
> pending and active PCI Card Production Assessments unless otherwise
> instructed by PCI SSC and comply with all post-revocation requirements
> specified in the CPSA Agreement.
>
> Refer to the CPSA Qualification Requirements for details on the
> Revocation process.

9.  # General Guidance

    1.  ## Resourcing /Transfers

> The CPSA Company is expected to arrange sufficient back-up of CPSA
> Employee resources so as not to impact a Card Production Entity's
> validation deadline in the event an assigned CPSA Employee is unable
> to complete a PCI Card Production Assessment.
>
> CPSA Employees may transfer to other companies. The following should
> be noted when a CPSA Employee moves to a new company:

1.  If the new company is not an active CPSA Company, the CPSA
    > Employee's qualification will be inactive until employed by an
    > active CPSA Company. Inactive status does not suspend or modify
    > requalification deadlines. A CPSA Employee cannot requalify while
    > its employer is not an active CPSA Company.

2.  If the CPSA Employee moves to an active CPSA Company and is to be
    > utilized by that CPSA Company as an CPSA Employee, the Primary
    > Contact of the new CPSA Company must notify the CPSA Program
    > Manager prior to permitting the CPSA Employee to participate in
    > any PCI Card Production Assessment. The following information must
    > be provided to the CPSA Program Manager:

    -   Name

    -   E-mail

    -   Phone

    1.  ## PCI SSC Logos and Marks

> Unless expressly authorized, a CPSA C[]{#_bookmark34 .anchor}ompany or
> CPSA Employee is not permitted to use any PCI SSC trademark, service
> mark, certification mark, or logo without the prior written consent of
> PCI SSC in each instance. A CPSA Program-specific logo is available on
> request via e-mail to the CPSA Program Manager.

## CPSA Company Changes

> In the event that a CPSA Company requires an alias or a trade name
> added to its listing on the Website---for example, \"trading as\" or
> "doing business as" (DBA) scenarios---please contact the CPSA Program
> Manager for the *Assessor Name Change Request Form.*

## FAQs and Guidance Documents

> CPSA Employees should refer to the [Frequently Asked
> Questions](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/faqs) (FAQ) section of
> the PCI SSC Website to obtain further guidance on questions relating
> to PCI Card Production Assessments. The Website should be monitored on
> a weekly basis as information is updated. RSS feed updates are
> available for the PCI Standards in the Document Library.
>
> CPSA Employees should periodically familiarize themselves with all
> Information Supplements and guidance published to the Website.

# Appendix B: Eight Guiding Principles Validated by Four Criteria (Four Cs)

> The Eight Guiding Principles represent a baseline for PCI SSC assessor
> companies and individuals (each an "Assessor") quality, and those
> principles can be validated by four criteria: consistency,
> credibility, competency, and conscientiousness−or "the Four Cs."
>
> The Eight Guiding Principles are as follows:

> PCI SSC reviews Assessor work product and stakeholder feedback with
> the expectation that the Assessor has followed the requirements of the
> applicable PCI SSC Program as documented in applicable Program
> documentation and has acted in the best interest of the customer in an
> ethical manner that results in factual, documented, and defendable
> opinions. Program participants must keep up with PCI SSC updates
> (included but not limited to updates to the CPSA Qualification
> Requirements and CPSA Program Guide, monthly Assessor Newsletter
> articles, published FAQs on the Website, and content from relevant
> webinars).
>
> The Four Cs are useful measurements to evaluate the strength and
> quality of the Assessor's approach and/or conclusions and can help the
> Assessor ensure that work can be defended in a meaningful way.
