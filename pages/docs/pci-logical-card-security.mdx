# Scope

> All systems and business processes associated with the logical
> security activities associated with card production and provisioning
> such as data preparation, pre-personalization, card personalization,
> PIN generation, PIN mailers, and card carriers and distribution must
> comply with the requirements in this document. Dependent on the
> services provided by the entity, some sections of this document may
> not be applicable.
>
> This document describes the logical security requirements required of
> entities that:

-   Perform cloud-based or secure element (SE) provisioning services;

-   Manage over-the-air (OTA) personalization, lifecycle management, and
    preparation of personalization data; or

-   Manage associated cryptographic keys.

> It does not apply to providers who are only performing the
> distribution of secure elements.
>
> Wherever the requirements specify personalization, the requirements
> also apply to cloud-based provisioning networksï£§e.g., those for host
> card emulation. Cloud-based systems differ from those based on
> requiring the use of a secure element on a mobile device.
>
> Within these requirements, all cited documentation must be validated
> at least every twelve months.
>
> Appendix A: Applicability of Requirements makes further refinement at
> the requirement level for physical cards and mobile provisioning.
>
> Although this document frequently states "vendor," the specific
> applicability of these requirements is up to the individual
> Participating Payment Brands; and the payment brand(s) of interest
> should be contacted for the applicability of these requirements to any
> card production or provisioning activity.
>
> Entities may adopt additional security controls as they deem
> appropriate, provided they are in addition to and enhance the
> procedures set forth in this manual.

## Purpose

> For the purposes of this document, personalization is defined as the
> preparation and writing of issuer or cardholder-specific data to the
> magnetic stripe or integrated circuit on the card. Subsequent use of
> the term "card personalization" includes data preparation,
> magnetic-stripe encoding, chip encoding, and mobile provisioning.
> Physical security requirements must also be satisfied. These
> requirements are intended to establish minimum security levels with
> which vendors must comply for magnetic-stripe encoding and chip
> personalization. However, physical requirements and procedures are
> beyond the scope of this document but can be found separately, in the
> *Payment Card Industry (PCI) Card Production and Provisioning Physical
> Security Requirements.*

## Focus

> The development, manufacture, transport, and personalization of
> payment cards and their components have a strong impact on the
> security structures of the payment systems, issuers, and vendors
> involved in their issuance. Data security is the primary focus of this
> document. Therefore, requirements for accessing, transporting, and
> storing data utilized during card production and provisioning are
> defined later in this document.

## Laws and Regulations

> In addition to the logical security requirements contained in this
> document, there will almost certainly be relevant regional and
> national laws and regulations, including consumer protection acts,
> labor agreements, health and safety regulations, etc. It is the
> responsibility of each individual organization independently to ensure
> that it obeys all local laws and regulations. Adherence to the
> requirements in this document does not imply compliance with local
> laws and regulations.
>
> If any of the requirements contained in this manual conflict with
> country, state, or local laws, the country, state, or local law will
> apply.

## Loss Prevention

> Compliance with the requirements specified in this manual will not
> warrant or imply the prevention of any or all unexplained product
> losses. Approved vendors are responsible for preventing any such
> losses. Vendors are liable for any unexplained loss, theft,
> deterioration, or destruction of card products or components that may
> occur while such products are in the vendor's facility. Vendors are
> required to carry liability insurance covering all the risks stated
> above, taking into consideration the plant location, physical
> conditions and security of the plant, the number and duties of the
> employees, and the nature and volume of the contracted work.

## Limitations

> Transaction authorization and settlement activities are performed on
> networks and systems that are separate from the card production and
> provisioning environment and are out of scope for this document.
>
> The individual Participating Payment Brands are responsible for
> defining and managing compliance programs associated with these
> requirements. Contact the Participating Payment Brand(s) of interest
> for any additional criteria.

> For implementations using Diffie-Hellman (DH) or Elliptic Curve
> Diffie-Hellman (ECDH):

-   **DH implementations entities** must securely generate and
    distribute the system-wide parameters: generator *g,* prime number
    *p* and parameter *q,* the large prime factor of (*p* - 1).
    Parameter p must be at least 2048 bits long, and parameter *q* must
    be at least 224 bits long. Each entity shall generate a private key
    *x* and a public key *y* using the domain parameters (*p, q, g*).

-   **ECDH implementations entities** must securely generate and
    distribute the system-wide parameters. Entities may generate the
    elliptic curve domain parameters or use a recommended curve (see
    *NIST SP 800-186*). The elliptic curve specified by the domain
    parameters must be at least as secure as P-224.

> Each entity shall generate a private key *d* and a public key *Q*
> using the specified elliptic curve domain parameters. (See *NIST SP
> 800-186* for methods of generating *d* and *Q*).

-   Each private key shall be statistically unique, unpredictable, and
    created using an approved random number generator as described in
    this document.

> Entities must authenticate the DH or ECDH public keys using DSA,
> ECDSA, a certificate, or a symmetric MAC (see *ISO 16609 -- Banking
> --Requirements* for message authentication using symmetric techniques.
> One of the following: MAC algorithm 1 using padding method 3, MAC
> algorithm 5 using padding method 4, should be used.

| > **Secret key**  | A cryptographic key used with a secret key       |
|                   | cryptographic algorithm that is uniquely         |
|                   | associated with one or more entities and should  |
|                   | not be made public. A secret key (symmetrical)   |
|                   | cryptographic algorithm uses a single secret key |
|                   | for both encryption and decryption. The use of   |
|                   | the term "secret" in this context does not imply |
|                   | a classification level; rather the term implies  |
|                   | the need to protect the key from disclosure or   |
|                   | substitution.                                    |
