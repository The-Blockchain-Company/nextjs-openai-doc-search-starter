# Prelude

We designed this paper to enable the reader to quickly vet our pitch by directly incorporating material from well known, established sources. Due to the rapid nature of technological change - especially as it relates to the blockchain, post quantum cryptography and quantum computing, we remain open minded to engineering the presently unknown. We do know that Quantum One’s QuantaVerse (our ecosystem) will include the following foundational (before chain genesis) tenets and capabilities:

1. Business & regulatory compliance 
2. Digital identity (web2 & web3)
3. Post quantum cryptography & encryption
4. Zero (0) anonymous user accounts
5. Interoperability (with compliant chains)
6. Web-agnostic
7. AI enabled 
8. 6G ready / iSIM interoperable 
9. Optional use of DAO of DAO’S organizational development framework 
10. ***Which gives us the framework to standardize healthcare data transfer at the API level. Post quantum secure, web3 interoperable, headless, —a replacement of HL7-FHIR—in DAO form with a side chain that stores all previously private now mandated public health plan negotiated rate data (Transparency In Coverage CMS Mandates)***
11. ***Collectively giving us even further rationale to build a Small Nuclear Reactor driven data center in the US.*** 

# Executive Summary

## As Steve Jobs so eloquently put, if you define the problem correctly, you almost have the solution. The elimination of blockchain investment risk is a by-product of engineering humanity’s optimal digital trust paradigm - a web-agnostic, omni-compliant, digital identity driven, post quantum secure, blockchain ecosystem.

In other words we believe that not only does the world lack a web-agnostic (classic internet web2 and web3 blockchain) legal identity only ecosystem capable of handling **high value, high volume, low barrier,** real world business use cases, they also lack: 

- Post quantum cryptography (PQC) & legacy to PQC migration management
- Business and regulatory compliance
- Machine identity, PKI administration - global digital governance
- Reliable, secure, & functional web2-to-web3 interoperability
- Zero (0) anonymous user accounts.
- iSIM identity
- Dedicated post quantum secure encrypted RF network for offline transactions and continuity.
- AI enabled
- Modular design
- Sovereign data ownership

## So What?

Within the omni-compliant QuantaVerse, stakers won’t have to worry about the impact of upcoming regulation. Financial blow-ups involving purported investor scams like FTX and Luna would be nearly impossible. Harmony One hacks would be probably thwarted. Marketers would flock to advertise on the QV after realizing our user data is 100% accurate. Security concious individuals would flock to the first post quantum secure ecosystem - blockchain or web2.

# **Quick Take**

- Enabling humanity’s optimal digital trust paradigm through our **omni-compliant, post quantum secure, zero (0) anonymous user, incentivized POS blockchain** ecosystem referred to as the ***QuantaVerse.***
- HealthONE is our **incentivized healthcare platform** where individuals, employers, insurers, and hospitals are **empowered and rewarded** for making decisions conducive to **reducing the total cost of care**.
- **MediClear** app to **make it easy for everyone** to view and analyze insurer and hospital negotiated rate data **associated with the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Transparency of Coverage mandates effective 7/1/2022**. Head to our [**MediClear prototype demo**](https://app.quantumone.network/mediclear-aetna-demo) and or learn more on the subject at [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/debgordon/2022/07/03/new-healthcare-price-transparency-rule-took-effect-july-1-but-it-may-not-help-much-yet/?sh=9f70f458e720).
    - This is our gateway to the masses. Aetna requires people to download multiple files before users realize they must download 30+GB JSON files that require file system modification to view.
    - *Most will find value in MediClear and thus Quantum One simply because **they will understand what we are doing unlike most blockchain companies focused on highly complex, relatively obscure to the masses issues***.
    - Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) [Transparency In Coverage mandates](https://www.cms.gov/healthplan-price-transparency) effective 7/1/2022 requiring all insurers to make public and easily accessible their negotiated health plan rates.
- ***The omni-compliant, zero (0) anonymous user, post quantum secure design of the QuantaVerse eliminates the vast majority of blockchain investment risk and, theoretically, will enable our chain to be approved and regulated by the SEC.***
- V1 launch in month 13 (from seed funding date) $450MM-$600MM projected POS revenue in months 13-24 based upon 600K and ***without product and service revenue.***
- Optimal usability, multi-context extensible trust, high value  →identity X compliance X web2 X web3 X quantum
- Public testnet of v1 ecosystem can begin within 60-90 days of seed funding
    - Includes token and NFT issuance, Smart Contracts, governance, protocol update-ability.
- Public testnet of the [HealthONE side chain and p2p network](https://github.com/quantum-one-dlt/quibitous) to begin within 60-90 days of seed funding.
- ***Partner valuation of Quantum One at $500MM - pre-HealthONE platform, side chain, and MediClear app***
- ***MediClear App.V1 release 60-90 days from seed funding***
- Post quantum secure VPN 60-120 days from seed funding

# Tenet 2: Compliance

## ***Identity and compliance exist to order chaos inherent within the human environment.***

**Both classic web and blockchain are not immune to these societal norms.** Both do not require prospective users to fully verify their identity prior to allowing access to their respective classic or blockchain ecosystems—such as LinkedIn or Ethereum. Layer 1 blockchains such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cardano, Algorand, & Solana also lack chain wide compliance for AML, KYC, CFTC, HIPPA, GDPR, SOC2, SEC, etc. These factors cause blockchain trust issues with lawmakers, businesses, regulators, and the masses. The trust issues exacerbate the siloed, unidentified nature of web2 ecosystem user environments leading to fragmented, inefficient, and scam ridden user experiences (try accessing user support on [Telegram](https://telegram.org) for the 2nd biggest exchange in the world [OKX](https://okx.com) to see what we mean). Furthermore, there is massive opportunity within the machine identity and mobile/IoT marker as a perfect storm of surging numbers of machines, virtual machines,  cloud implementations and by extension security credentials, post quantum cryptographic standard migrations, and the lack of an optimal administration tool results a global web vision ripe with opportunity.

# Tenets: Post Quantum Cryptography

- An excerpt of [Fierce Electronics’ 10/2021 interview](https://www.fierceelectronics.com/electronics/quantum-expert-hack-now-decrypt-later-here-today) with Duncan Jones of Cambridge Quantum:

> FE: In the long run, can quantum encryption stay ahead of quantum-based security attacks?
DJ: The danger facing companies and governments today is the risk of a "hack now, decrypt later" attack. This occurs when an attacker records encrypted data sent today, which is later decrypted on a quantum computer in the future. In this sense, quantum attacks have already begun. This is why it's important for companies to explore quantum-safe technology as soon as possible.
FE: What can governments do right now to better protect their citizens from the effects of quantum threats? 
DJ: Governments need to acknowledge the risk of "hack-now, decrypt-later" attacks and stop giving blanket advice that companies should wait before transitioning to quantum-safe algorithms. There are many ways to adopt quantum-safe algorithms today that will add value to existing systems. Similarly, governments should be highlighting how quantum technology can enhance existing solutions. For instance, the generation of keys seeded from provably perfect entropy is possible today, and enhances existing solutions. This is the only approach to generating keys that is resistant to attack from a quantum adversary.
FE: Which sectors, data and devices will become most vulnerable to attack if not made quantum-safe today? What should individual companies be doing about this today?
DJ: Any company that transmits long-term sensitive data (such as health records) must seriously consider the threat of "hack now, decrypt later.” Companies running these systems should be exploring quantum-safe algorithms and key generation today.
Similarly, IoT devices should be transitioning to quantum-safe technology as soon as possible. This is because IoT devices will be deployed in the field for many years, and likely beyond the point where quantum computers can break their encryption. This applies to many critical sectors, like heavy industry and utilities

# Deloitte: Crypto Vulnerability

- According to [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/risk/articles/quantum-risk-to-the-ethereum-blockchain.html), 65% of all Ethereum is vulnerable to quantum attacks using Shor’s algorithm

Deloitte's take on Bitcoin’s quantum problem

- According to [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/innovatie/artikelen/quantum-computers-and-the-bitcoin-blockchain.html), 25% of all Bitcoin are vulnerable to quantum attacks using Shor’s algorithm. What would happen to crypto investors overnight if a hack of only half of that magnitude happened?

## AI

Imagine asking an AI bot such as ChatGPT to provide the type and probability of economic arbitrage appearing across every sector, every product, and every asset. Think about the currently unknown arbitrage that will result due to the ever increasing knowledge of the arbitrage bot. Think web crawlers for arbitrage. 

Now shift gift gears into healthcare data — both medical and fiscal in type. Applying the principles of the arbitrage bot, and understanding the gravity of recent US CMS mandates as of 7/1/2022 requiring health insurers to make public in a easy to read, customer friendly format for all negotiated rates for all healthplans, consider the value both known and unknown presently locked in this light and utilized as training material for the healthcare bot. Considering all present knowledge, digital healthcare could easily be an 809B $USD market by 2030. How large is the implied unknown? How large is the implied unknown from a quantum computing perspective? We believe large enough for the digital healthcare market to exceed 1 trillion $USD by 2030.  

And how about the arbitrage bot? Will arbitrage exist in an incredibly fast post quantum era? Will humans facilitate an economy where goods and services transact at a present day high frequency trading quants equivalence? Probably not. Discuss with us further by scheduling a pitch meeting or a callback at [quantumonedao.zendesk.com](https://quantumonedao.zendesk.com). 

The topic of AI is polarizing. Lets dive in at Brookings:

# Digital Governance for All

The demand for post quantum secure digital governance capable of administering the data, machines, and humans associated with the tenets above should now be clear to the reader. 

From a healthcare perspective, lets consider this proposed governance model for the application of AI in healthcare

Non Tech Pitch & USP

Its natural to a be afraid of the unknown. In fact this fear is what has prevented people and businesses from participating in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology en masse. The unknown has also prevented regulators and lawmakers from giving their stamp of approval. We're trying to change that with the first web-agnostic(web2, web3, web5 etc) omni-compliant, software, networking and organizational development hybrid blockchain ecosystem. At it’s core, Quantum One is anchored by a digital identity ecosystem designed to deliver optimal value, usability, longevity, minimal barriers, and extensible trust contexts across both web2 and web3 anchored by the societal tenets of identity and compliance.. All while preparing for yet another, rapidly approaching unknown - quantum computing. QuantumONE is poised to take advantage of both the blockchain/cryptocurrency market and is fully prepared to integrate into quantum computers when they are realized and prepared for mass production; believe it or not, this technology is not so far off. QuantumONE's USP is that, because of the ability of the blockchain to fully authenticate each and every user (whether they be a business, a person, or a government entity), our blockchain (and, therefore, any crypto coin or non-fungible token we create) is both anti-money laundering compliant and SEC compliant. Because of these two factors, QuantumONE will be the first blockchain/cryptocurrency that will be recognized and approved by the SEC, and we believe that this will attract industry level investors, since there is a real, tangible, value associated with the cryptocurrency. This also prevents bad-actors from being prevalent in the QuantumONE ecosystem, since all users will be fully authenticated and registered before they are allowed to utilize any of the QuantumONE systems, applications, exchanges, products, or purchase any of QuantumONE's eventual cryptocurrencies; such bad-actors (colloquially known as 'hackers') are disincentive from participation in the QuantumONE ecosystem since they would be forced to reveal their true identity and their veil of anonymity would be shattered.

# Business Model & Solution

We’re utilizing the technological and fiscal advantages afforded by an **incentivized proof-of-stake (POS) blockchain ecosystem to offer services at unbeatable prices**. The QuantaVerse is designed to generate approximately **$700-$1000 of revenue per user per year — before on chain products and services are enabled**. Each month, the blockchain automatically reconciles itself and transfers all rewards — derived from staking and transaction fees — to both users and our Treasury account. It is this process and **cash flow** that’s driving our 1st year revenue projections of $450MM-$600MM based upon 600K users. **The number of users may end up being quite conservative considering our plan to use MediClear as a gateway to the masses**. MediClear is the app that makes it easy for everyone to view and analyze healthcare data associated with **US CMS [Transparency In Coverage](https://www.forbes.com/sites/debgordon/2022/07/03/new-healthcare-price-transparency-rule-took-effect-july-1-but-it-may-not-help-much-yet/?sh=11efbc48e720) mandates**. As most people understand that the lack of rate transparency is a significant, long standing issue, we believe **MediClear will be easily understood, valued and trusted**. This will naturally lead people to have a significant interest in our incentivized healthcare platform — HealthONE and, thus, have a significant interest in our omni-compliant, post quantum secure blockchain (QuantaVerse). **We wouldn’t be surprised if we double or triple our 600K user forecast.** However, **we will remain conservative with our projections** and maintain the aforementioned forecast. 

Quantum Ones omni-compliant, digital identity ecosystem is monetized by a unique POS (proof-of-stake) revenue model that was developed to foster a strong balance sheet, mitigate risk factors, and to cache dry powder. For those who need a primer on proof-of-stake revenue models, here's an article from Coindesk comparing POS to POW (proof-of-work)

[Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake: What Is the Difference?](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-what-is-the-difference/)

Here's a break down of Quantum One and our POS revenue model.

Every user fully identified within an omni-compliant environment = SEC approved and regulated blockchain ecosystem built for the trust required for mass adoption. The SEC essentially holds the golden key to mass adoption - with their approval, trust of the masses will follow close behind. And as a US based DAO, Quantum One Stands to benefit 

Projected Revenue

- $450MM-$600MM projected in 1st 12 months after mainnet POS launch
- Revenue per user/account to average $700-$1000 during 1st 12 months - without consideration for product and service revenue
- This cash flow allows us to widen our margins almost at will for our products and services
- We’re offering to manage the publication of the Transparency In Coverage healthcare rate data for insurers and hospitals provided they stake our coin.

Stability Fund Allocations

- $36MM in fund at launch assuming $200MM raise
- 18% of all capital ever raised & all ecosystem revenue until fund reaches $1B

Omni-compliant 

- AML, crypto-AML, CFTC, GDPR, HIPPA, SOC2, SEC, and eventually all others legally possible.

We expect further growth between months 24-36 associated with the myriad of usability contexts mentioned in the Quick Take above. 

# Ease of Use

One of the biggest issues influencing the adoption of web3 technology or lack thereof is the complexity of use. We're ensuring that people with basic computer experience can setup and run a node - with one click! And our mobile app will reflect the same mentality. (More to be added soon)

# Potential Users & Investors

How many people do you know that are concerned about the lack of cost transparency within their healthcare experience? When US Congress passes a law requiring companies to simply possess a level of business ethics, you know there’s a problem. And a significant one at that. This is why we are focusing on launching MediClear ASAP. As a reminder, MediClear makes it easy for everyone to access and view healthcare data associated with CMS’s Transparency In Coverage mandates. 

Considering the mandates for insurers became effective less then 6 month ago, we have a great opportunity to build several million users within a relatively short period of time. Users will value the MediClear product and our integrity and thus have an almost immediate interest in our incentivized healthcare platform —HealthONE — and, by extension, our blockchain ecosystem —the QuantaVerse. Keeping in mind that we previously projected 600K users in the 1st 12 months after launch equating to $450MM-$600MM in revenue, we have a great shot at reaching $1B+ in 1st year revenue. 

- SEC approval of an omni-compliant, digital identity web agnostic ecosystem will lead to industry level investment and a value prop greater than Bitcoin /

# Competitive Landscape

Who else is in our realm? The question becomes, is there another omni compliant digital identity based web agnostic ecosystem? No. Are there any blockchains seeking SEC approval? Not any we are aware of —the Bitcoin ETF could be a watershed moment however, this does not mean Bitcoin is an approved and regulated blockchain. First movers are always mimicked and we will not be an exception. Therefore, we must assume that everyone is an SEC approved blockchain and plan accordingly. Which is why we're also focusing on transitioning our high value multi-context  ecosystem to the post quantum era. Is there a omni-compliant, digital identity ecosystem for the quantum computing era? No, not yet. First we will list a few comparable companies that are enabling digital identity ecosystems.

# Marketing

### SEC

Becoming SEC approved and regulated will essentially be a massive marketing ploy in it of itself. We anticipate the MSM will do much of our initial marketing for us by simply following our roadmap. 

In early summer of 2022, we noticed an article indicating that 99% of all blockchain company ceo’s and heads do not involve AP press releases in their marketing strategy. This was not surprising to us considering the blockchain worlds perspective on identity, regulatory compliance, and the SEC in particular. It’s almost as if the BW has been and remains in their own bubble—why expect anything different when it comes to marketing? The Discords, Reddits, Telegrams etc. are often echo chambers within marketing vacuums that are almost entirely cutoff from the very people we want to reach. How will mass adoption occur if we keep our story within the confines of a pre-defined set of users? It’s almost anti-blockchain when you think about it.  Although we will have a presence on the traditional crypto social media outlets until our ecosystem is live and we disavow all ecosystems who don’t fully identify their users, we plan to take full advantage of the AP and main stream media’s marketing prowess.

### CNBC, Bloomberg, AMCNews

CNBC’s & Bloomberg’s Advancements TV hosted by Ted Danson has contacted us a few times to make an 8 minute episode appearance. For $50K, we get 8 minutes on Int’l broadcast TV with Ted Danson and life time rights to all recordings. At the right moment, it could be very beneficial for the first SEC approved and regulated blockchain. 

We were also offered  1 minute and 30 seconds on AMCNews TV for $5K

# Equity Distribution

The following is excerpted from our investor pitch deck.

![Screenshot_20220715-114904_Office.jpg](Quantum%20One%20Whitepaper%207df3771e24184020b3ffbf808d140ae6/Screenshot_20220715-114904_Office.jpg)

## Vitalik Butterin

It's important to mention we donated 12.5K DA-FI tokens to Vitalik Butterin in early January 2022. In the 6 months that followed, we contacted him multiple times through email and social media. His lack of response and involvement became a detractor for Quantum One DAO and therefore, as head DAO stewards, we had an obligation to remove Vitalik from equity ownership. Therefore, upon deployment of 500B (billion) Quantum One Roton coin, we plan to immediately burn 125B (billion) Roton to account for the removal. We have publicly announced his removal via Twitter while tagging his Twitter username. 

The original rationale behind the decision to donate to Vitalik was multi-faceted and was intended for the following objectives: 
- Appreciation for Vitalik's dedication to the development of blockchain technology- 50% to be allocated toward a quantum computing and cryptography related research vessel for Ethereum- 50% dedicated to the Roton stake required for efficient facilitation of omni-compliant, post-quantum secure QuantaVerse to Ethereum bridge. 

In retrospect, although we had great intentions, it was a decision that ended up costing us the most valuable resource of all - time. We must account for the removal by updating our Articles of Incorporation.
